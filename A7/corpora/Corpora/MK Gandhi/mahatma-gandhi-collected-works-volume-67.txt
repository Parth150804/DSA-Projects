('67', 0, 3, 4, 88) Yes, we have to submit to the most exacting orders 1 if we are to learn the art of non violence.
('67', 0, 3, 5, 185) Our submission has therefore to be cheerful and intelligent.

('67', 0, 6, 9, 344) WARDHA, April 25, 1935
('67', 0, 7, 10, 367) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('67', 0, 8, 11, 383) I have your letter.
('67', 0, 8, 12, 403) Extra copies of Harijan will be sent to you.
('67', 0, 8, 13, 448) Your description of the meeting in the S. E. of London is entertaining.
('67', 0, 8, 14, 520) Do not expect me to write another autobiography unless you would send me to prison for a fairly long term and procure the necessary permission to write it there.
('67', 0, 8, 15, 682) The papers can certainly be collected and printed.
('67', 0, 8, 16, 733) Mahadev can do it best.
('67', 0, 8, 17, 757) But he is overloaded with work.
('67', 0, 8, 18, 789) Nevertheless I shall see what is possible.
('67', 0, 8, 19, 832) I do hope C. F. Andrews was able to go to his sisters.
('67', 0, 8, 20, 887) Yes, it is good he proposed to stay there for two weeks.
('67', 0, 8, 21, 944) According to his cable, he should have started ere this reaches you.
('67', 0, 8, 22, 1013) But if he is still there, please tell him he can stay longer if he likes.
('67', 0, 8, 23, 1087) For the moment I am reconciled to the outdoor life.
('67', 0, 8, 24, 1139) Mira is absorbed in her garden work from early morning to late in the evening.
('67', 0, 8, 25, 1218) Do not expect any letter from her for some time.
('67', 0, 8, 26, 1267) You see, we are trying to become villagers but we are [far] from the thing.
('67', 0, 8, 27, 1343) She is the whole hogger among us all.
('67', 0, 8, 28, 1381) I am purposely not writing anything to C. F. A. as I expect he will have left before this is in your hands.

('67', 1, 6, 13, 2075) MARY, If you had told me what to send I would have sent the amount.
('67', 1, 6, 14, 2143) But you are in the midst of friends.
('67', 1, 6, 15, 2180) Let the bills come, they would be honoured nevertheless.
('67', 1, 6, 16, 2237) If you want me to send you cash please write.
('67', 1, 7, 17, 2283) I have told you in my wire that I could easily arrange for your examination in Bombay or Nagpur.
('67', 1, 7, 18, 2380) My impression is that there is the apparatus in Wardha also.
('67', 1, 7, 19, 2441) But if the friends there advise otherwise, their advice should be followed.
('67', 1, 7, 20, 2517) We were all glad to see Duncan 4. He does not look strong.
('67', 1, 7, 21, 2576) He will be here for two days.
('67', 1, 7, 22, 2606) Chandra is selfish.
('67', 1, 7, 23, 2626) She prefers to be on the floor from which there is no fall.
('67', 1, 7, 24, 2686) And she would watch the fun of my slipping from the bed down to the floor and probably having a bump on the forehead.
('67', 1, 7, 25, 2804) Tell her I shall succumb to none of her wiles.

('67', 2, 1, 2, 3142) 5. LETTER TO AMRIT KAUR
('67', 2, 2, 3, 3166) April 26, 1935
('67', 2, 3, 4, 3181) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('67', 2, 4, 5, 3196) I have your letter.
('67', 2, 4, 6, 3216) The sooner you go to Simla, the better.
('67', 2, 4, 7, 3256) You will do what work you can from there.
('67', 2, 4, 8, 3298) It is well to recognize your limitations.
('67', 2, 4, 9, 3340) Evidently both of you need the change.
('67', 2, 4, 10, 3379) Of course your yarn will be utilized.
('67', 2, 4, 11, 3417) You will have to spin for many months at the present rate before I can get a sari for Ba and a loin cloth for myself.
('67', 2, 4, 12, 3535) But that is not just now of consequence.
('67', 2, 4, 13, 3576) All that will come after your second training here.
('67', 2, 4, 14, 3628) It is a tragedy that you cannot find anyone in all Jullundur who knows all the processes.
('67', 2, 4, 15, 3718) When one comes to think of it, the progress of spinning among the so called cultured classes is very little.
('67', 2, 4, 16, 3827) Dalip Singh will find when he settles down to work among the Harijans that they have skill enough to earn a living but that as labourers they do not get employment as easily as the others and that as artisans they do not find customers for their wares.
('67', 2, 4, 17, 4080) No doubt improvement can be and should be made in their method of dealing with hide.
('67', 2, 4, 18, 4165) But this will follow his taking up the work.
('67', 2, 4, 19, 4210) He need not work as a representative of our organization.
('67', 2, 4, 20, 4268) He can work independently and yet get all the technical assistance he may need from us to the extent of our capacity.
('67', 2, 4, 21, 4386) The rain did interfere with our work at Indore but not much.
('67', 2, 4, 22, 4447) It damaged the village crafts exhibition that was held as a side show.
('67', 2, 4, 23, 4518) The womens meeting too went off quite nicely.
('67', 2, 4, 24, 4564) Thousands of them came out, many perhaps for the first time in their lives.
('67', 2, 5, 25, 4640) Yours, BAPU [PS.]

('67', 3, 2, 3, 4813) April 26, 1935
('67', 3, 3, 4, 4828) NARANDAS, Enclosed is a letter from Mathew.
('67', 3, 3, 5, 4872) I have written to him and told him not to expect Rs. 65 at present.
('67', 3, 3, 6, 4940) He cant be given anything more than what I mentioned.
('67', 3, 3, 7, 4994) I have also told him that just now he would have to join as no better than a labourer.
('67', 3, 3, 8, 5081) If he proves his worth, we may think further provided circumstances permit.
('67', 3, 3, 9, 5157) He may be given railway fare if anything is owing to him in the accounts here, otherwise he will have to find even that from where he is.
('67', 3, 3, 10, 5295) The prize of Rs. 1,00,000 has not been awarded to anybody.
('67', 3, 3, 11, 5354) But it may be awarded if a good enough model of spinning wheel is received.
('67', 3, 3, 12, 5430) I have still not received a copy of the resolution.
('67', 3, 3, 13, 5482) It contains three main points: that the model cannot be considered handy; that only a model which is small enough for a village house and can be easily lifted and moved whenever necessary can be considered handy; and that such a model cannot be manufactured within Rs. 150. Would it require frequent repairs?
('67', 3, 3, 14, 5791) And would the expenses on repairs exceed five per cent of the cost annually?
('67', 3, 3, 15, 5868) I enclose a copy of the specific defects pointed out by Vinoba and Kakasaheb.
('67', 3, 3, 16, 5946) If Keshu 1can remove these defects, let him do so.
('67', 3, 3, 17, 5997) Kales machine is not with me.
('67', 3, 3, 18, 6027) It had gone to Ahmedabad.
('67', 3, 3, 19, 6053) I have asked them to send it back.
('67', 3, 3, 20, 6088) But I may not get it back and, therefore, may not be able to have a look at it.
('67', 3, 3, 21, 6168) It is better that Keshu should remain there and go on with his experiment.
('67', 3, 3, 22, 6243) Let him stay with you.
('67', 3, 3, 23, 6266) He should fix a limit for the expenditure on the experiments.
('67', 3, 3, 24, 6328) If he wishes to come to me, he may certainly do so.
('67', 3, 3, 25, 6380) But I wont be able to tell him anything more or guide him further.
('67', 3, 3, 26, 6447) There is nothing more to be explained about this experiment.
('67', 3, 3, 27, 6508) Even if his invention does not deserve a prize of Rs. 1,00,000, whatever improvements he discovers are bound to be useful.
('67', 3, 3, 28, 6631) If the machine for making slivers has been perfected, it is also a good thing.
('67', 3, 3, 29, 6710) Let him describe in detail what progress he has made with it.
('67', 3, 3, 30, 6772) Since I have explained everything in this letter, I am not writing separately to him.
('67', 3, 3, 31, 6858) You may now organize the school as you think best.

('67', 4, 1, 3, 7062) Languages should be taught from a different point of view altogether.
('67', 4, 1, 4, 7132) At present they are taught from a literary point of view.
('67', 4, 1, 5, 7190) We should teach them simply as languages.
('67', 4, 1, 6, 7232) The curriculum should include Gujarati, Hindi and English and a little bit of Sanskrit.
('67', 4, 1, 7, 7320) The pupils should be taught the Urdu script.
('67', 4, 1, 8, 7365) Instruction in these subjects should be easy.
('67', 4, 1, 9, 7411) They can be taught while the pupils learn crafts.
('67', 4, 1, 10, 7461) The crafts should be such as would bring the pupils some payment.
('67', 4, 1, 11, 7527) There should be no fee, the pupils earning through crafts being counted as fee.
('67', 4, 1, 12, 7607) Beyond a fixed limit, the earning would go to the pupil.
('67', 4, 1, 13, 7664) The fee should include all the expenses.
('67', 4, 1, 14, 7705) You can introduce these changes gradually without much trumpeting or publicity.
('67', 4, 1, 15, 7785) Find the staff locally, if possible.
('67', 4, 1, 16, 7822) There should be no highly paid teacher.
('67', 4, 1, 17, 7862) Kusum 1, Lilavati 2
('67', 4, 2, 18, 7882) and others who have got trained should be your staff.
('67', 4, 2, 19, 7936) If Keshu helps, nothing like it.
('67', 4, 2, 20, 7969) Think over this.
('67', 4, 2, 21, 7986) If you wish to discuss this matter further with me, you may do so.
('67', 4, 2, 22, 8053) Do something about the inspection of Tituss 3 work and finish with it.

('67', 4, 9, 30, 8347) BALVANTSINHA,
('67', 4, 10, 31, 8361) I enquired and found your assertion to be true.
('67', 4, 10, 32, 8409) The unaskedfor report gave me pain.
('67', 4, 10, 33, 8445) Now Mahadev on being questioned tells me that Kanti had tried persuasion.
('67', 4, 10, 34, 8519) Did you inform before you left?

('67', 5, 5, 5, 8846) [Before April 27, 1935]
('67', 5, 6, 6, 8870) GANDHIJI: How much did you spin yesterday?
('67', 5, 7, 7, 8913) BHANSALI: Not at all, I am sorry to say.
('67', 5, 8, 8, 8954) G. But I thought you had started spinning?
('67', 5, 9, 9, 8997) B. I did about fifty yards the other day.
('67', 5, 9, 10, 9039) But that's all.
('67', 5, 10, 11, 9055) G. How nice it would be if you would make a loin cloth for me .
('67', 5, 10, 12, 9119) I should be very glad if you could make a pair, but even one would satisfy me.
('67', 5, 11, 13, 9198) B. It would be a rare privilege to be able to spin for your loin cloth, but you know my state of mind!
('67', 5, 12, 14, 9301) Next day again there was a talk.
('67', 5, 12, 15, 9334) With child like naivete he asked Gandhiji, You do not want the loin cloth.
('67', 5, 12, 16, 9409) You want me to work.
('67', 5, 12, 17, 9430) Don't you?
('67', 5, 13, 18, 9441) G. You are right.
('67', 5, 13, 19, 9459) But if you must work, why not do this thing for me?
('67', 5, 14, 20, 9511) B. If I must work, why not command me to do some other work?
('67', 5, 14, 21, 9572) I am not worthy to do this sacred thing for you.
('67', 5, 15, 22, 9621) G. But surely those who spun for the cloth I am wearing were by no means purer than you.
('67', 5, 16, 23, 9710) B. No, Bapu.
('67', 5, 16, 24, 9723) I am humbler than even the humblest, humbler than the dust of their feet.
('67', 5, 17, 25, 9797) Harijan, 27 4 1935
('67', 5, 18, 26, 9816) 2 The discussion is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 5, 18, 27, 9881) 3 Mahadev Desai had concluded: The next day old associaters like Kakasaheb tackled him.
('67', 5, 18, 28, 9969) Bhansali persisted in pleading his unworthiness.
('67', 5, 18, 29, 10018) But, said Kakasaheb, supposing Bapu were to ask one of us to fetch a glass of water, and if all of us were to say to him, we are sorry, Bapu, we have not the purity to do anything for you, what would happen to Bapu? That seemed to go straight home.
('67', 5, 18, 30, 10267) Bhansali wrote (for he talks only to Gandhiji): All right, then.
('67', 5, 18, 31, 10332) I spin.
('67', 5, 18, 32, 10340) I shall err on the safe side. And he is now regularly spinning.

('67', 6, 1, 2, 10450) 9. A GROWING VICE?
('67', 6, 2, 3, 10469) The Principal of the Sanatana Dharma College, Lahore, writes:
('67', 6, 3, 4, 10531) Allow me to request you to peruse the accompanying newspaper cutting, notices, etc., which speak for themselves.
('67', 6, 3, 5, 10644) The Youth Welfare Association is doing very useful work here in the Punjab.
('67', 6, 3, 6, 10720) It has attracted notice in academic and administrative quarters, while it has secured the active interest of enlightened guardians of boys.
('67', 6, 3, 7, 10860) Pandit Sitaram Das of Bihar is the leading spirit of this movement which counts very many distinguished people here among its patrons.
('67', 6, 4, 8, 10995) The evil of juvenile seduction is admittedly more rampant in the Punjab and North West Frontier Province than elsewhere in India.
('67', 6, 5, 9, 11125) May I pray that you will draw the attention of the country to this canker through a note or letter in Harijan or in any other newspaper?
('67', 6, 5, 10, 11262) The Secretary of the Youth League wrote to me long ago on this very delicate subject.
('67', 6, 5, 11, 11348) On receiving his letter I entered into correspondence with Dr. Gopichand 1 who confirmed the statements made in the League Secretarys letter.
('67', 6, 5, 12, 11490) But I could not see my way clear to discussing the problem in these columns or elsewhere.
('67', 6, 5, 13, 11580) I had known of the evil but was not sure that a newspaper discussion could deal with it to any purpose.
('67', 6, 5, 14, 11684) Nor am I sure now.
('67', 6, 5, 15, 11703) But I may not resist the appeal of the Principal of the College.
('67', 6, 5, 16, 11768) The vice is not new.
('67', 6, 5, 17, 11789) It is widespread.
('67', 6, 5, 18, 11807) As it is necessarily kept secret, it is not possible to detect it easily.
('67', 6, 5, 19, 11881) It goes hand in hand with easy life.
('67', 6, 5, 20, 11918) In the case referred to by the Principal, the teachers are alleged to be the corruptors of their own wards.
('67', 6, 5, 21, 12026) When the salt loses its savour wherewith shall it be salted? This is a matter which no commission, no government can deal with successfully.
('67', 6, 5, 22, 12167) It is the function of the moral reformer.
('67', 6, 5, 23, 12209) The parents have to be awakened to a sense of their responsibility.
('67', 6, 5, 24, 12277) The students should be brought in close touch with clean life.
('67', 6, 5, 25, 12340) The idea that ethics and clean living are the foundation of true education, should be seriously propagated.
('67', 6, 5, 26, 12448) Trustees of educational institutions have to exercise the greatest care in the selection of teachers, and having selected them they have to see to it that they remain up to the mark.
('67', 6, 5, 27, 12631) These are some of the ways in which the awful vice can be brought under control even if it cannot be eradicated.

('67', 7, 8, 11, 13147) JAMNALAL,
('67', 7, 9, 12, 13157) Kamalnayan 2 has left for Allahabad.
('67', 7, 9, 13, 13194) I have written to .
('67', 7, 9, 14, 13214) 3 that I would be glad if she could come here; I should like to meet her before the betrothal takes place.
('67', 7, 9, 15, 13321) Ramakrishna 4 had accompanied me to Indore.
('67', 7, 9, 16, 13365) He has been detained there by Gulab for two or three days.
('67', 7, 9, 17, 13424) He will see Ujjain and other places nearby.
('67', 7, 9, 18, 13468) Both are expected to arrive today.
('67', 7, 9, 19, 13503) Prabhavati 5 had a letter from Brijkishorebabu 6 He has written to her that she should be ready to go to Bihar when he asks her to do so.
('67', 7, 9, 20, 13641) That means she may have to go there even when there are no holidays.
('67', 7, 9, 21, 13710) Prabhavati has replied to him that she will be ready to leave as soon as she hears from him.
('67', 7, 9, 22, 13803) Chaudhari has come here .
('67', 7, 9, 23, 13829) 7 I do not know what talk you have had, but from what he and Valunjkar said, I understand that you are prepared to give his wife Rs. 100 for serving in the maternity home.
('67', 7, 9, 24, 14001) I do not remember having discussed this subject with you.
('67', 7, 10, 25, 14059) 1 Also known as Bhikshu Nirmalanand 2 Addressees sons 3 The name has been imitted 4 Addressees sons 5 Wife of Jayaprakash Narayan 6 Omissions as in the source 7 ibid.

('67', 8, 1, 2, 14272) I do remember that Chaudhari had talked to me.
('67', 8, 1, 3, 14319) On the basis of our talk, Chaudharis wife has resigned from the Seva Sadan at Poona.
('67', 8, 1, 4, 14404) Chaudhari has already arrived here, and his wife also will be arriving soon.
('67', 8, 1, 5, 14481) From your postcard to Valunjkar, it appears that you have not come to any decision so far.
('67', 8, 1, 6, 14572) You do not even know that lady.
('67', 8, 1, 7, 14604) Please write to me what you would now like to do about this matter.
('67', 8, 1, 8, 14672) His wife can be lodged in the orchard for the time being, though it may not be possible to accommodate.
('67', 8, 1, 9, 14776) The maternity home will have to be built, and perhaps, we shall have to consider the desirability of building it in the orchard.
('67', 8, 1, 10, 14905) If you have decided to engage that lady, then some portion of the upper storey of the old bungalow or of the new one in which you are now living should be spared for cases of delivery.
('67', 8, 1, 11, 15090) But before taking in such cases, she should visit the women in their homes and examine ordinary cases, give them medicines, meet village women, and so on.
('67', 8, 1, 12, 15245) For starting a maternity home, it will also be necessary to spend some money on buying cots, etc.
('67', 8, 1, 13, 15343) All this can be done only after you arrive here and think over the whole matter.
('67', 8, 1, 14, 15424) The main thing, however, is, whether or not you wish to engage that lady.
('67', 8, 1, 15, 15498) Chaudhari cannot be given Rs. 100 from the Industries Association.
('67', 8, 1, 16, 15565) The Association can give him Rs. 25 per month at the most, for he can be useful only in the experiments of making hand made paper.
('67', 8, 1, 17, 15696) I will pay a short visit to Bombay to see Kamala 1 .
('67', 8, 1, 18, 15749) I think it will be difficult to see her while she is on her way.
('67', 8, 1, 19, 15814) Madalasa 2 must have arrived there.
('67', 8, 1, 20, 15850) I should like you to give up travelling by trains and cars for some time.

('67', 9, 3, 4, 16170) LILAVATI, I have certainly no plans for a tour.
('67', 9, 3, 5, 16218) Perhaps I may have to go to Borsad.
('67', 9, 3, 6, 16254) In the beginning of May at any rate I shall be here.
('67', 9, 3, 7, 16307) You will stay with me in the orchard here.
('67', 9, 3, 8, 16350) There is no room.
('67', 9, 3, 9, 16368) We are living in the verandah.
('67', 9, 3, 10, 16399) There is a room but only large enough to keep our things in.

('67', 9, 6, 15, 16602) April 27, 1935
('67', 9, 7, 16, 16617) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I have made mention to you of Sharma from Khurja.
('67', 9, 7, 17, 16686) He has some familiarity with nature cure.
('67', 9, 7, 18, 16728) I have known him for years.
('67', 9, 7, 19, 16756) He intends to gain some experience at Battle Creek and later visit some nature cure clinics of Europe, spending in all one and a half years.
('67', 9, 7, 20, 16897) He is self sacrificing and clever but of a slightly erratic temperament.
('67', 9, 7, 21, 16970) He is full of the spirit of service.
('67', 9, 7, 22, 17007) He had a clinic of his own which he has squandered away.
('67', 9, 7, 23, 17064) He had published a few books which he has burnt because they contained little knowledge gained from experience.
('67', 9, 7, 24, 17176) I want to send Sharma to America and Europe using some funds out of the amount you intend to give me for this year.
('67', 9, 7, 25, 17292) If this has your approval, find out and let me know what the journey to Battle Creek will cost and the convenient route.
('67', 9, 7, 26, 17413) He will of course travel third or deck whichever is available.
('67', 9, 7, 27, 17476) What would be the cost of living there in poverty?
('67', 9, 7, 28, 17527) Do they take students at Battle Creek?
('67', 9, 7, 29, 17566) Would it be better for him to go via Japan?
('67', 9, 7, 30, 17610) How are you keeping now?
('67', 9, 7, 31, 17635) You will have seen that I have taken up the burden of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.

('67', 10, 2, 3, 17885) SHARMA,
('67', 10, 3, 4, 17893) What is this?
('67', 10, 3, 5, 17907) The matter was trivial but pregnant with great import.
('67', 10, 3, 6, 17962) I did take note of what you said.
('67', 10, 3, 7, 17996) The load was more than you could carry and you needed assistance.
('67', 10, 3, 8, 18062) This was what pained me.
('67', 10, 3, 9, 18087) We are poor people; why need we carry so much luggage?
('67', 10, 3, 10, 18142) You did not need anything beyond a book, a blanket, a towel, a lota, a bowl, a sheet, a dhoti, a kurta and a cap.
('67', 10, 3, 11, 18256) Why did you bring more articles?
('67', 10, 3, 12, 18289) And since you had brought, you should have quietly called a porter and left, or you could have even left behind the excess luggage as I had suggested.
('67', 10, 3, 13, 18440) Neither Bhagwanji nor Kishoreprasad should have gone.
('67', 10, 3, 14, 18494) Both were busy but went to help you to carry the luggage.
('67', 10, 3, 15, 18552) That Kishoreprasad was also carrying letters is beside the point.
('67', 10, 3, 16, 18618) You had no reason at all to feel hurt.
('67', 10, 3, 17, 18657) You ought to have taken a lesson from the incident.
('67', 10, 3, 18, 18709) If even now you have learnt it, the incident will have served a useful purpose.
('67', 10, 3, 19, 18789) I have already despatched the letter 1

('67', 11, 3, 5, 19220) I have sent a wire to Titus asking him to hand over charge to you immediately and to wait there till the arrival of Narandas and then come over here.
('67', 11, 3, 6, 19370) I have also written to him.
('67', 11, 3, 7, 19398) Do you have any suspicion regarding his integrity?
('67', 11, 3, 8, 19449) If possible I wish to keep him with us.

('67', 11, 7, 16, 19712) How did your health take a bad turn once again?
('67', 11, 7, 17, 19760) Did the Punjabi vaidyas treatment fail?
('67', 11, 7, 18, 19800) I hope you have gone to Rajkot and that your health has improved.
('67', 11, 7, 19, 19866) Purshottams letter is such that instead of being unhappy by it, we should feel happy.
('67', 11, 7, 20, 19952) He should get the blessings of us all in his happy decision.

('67', 11, 9, 24, 20138) 2 Addressees daughter 3 In his letter to addressees son Purshottam, dated April 18, 1935, Gandhiji says May you live long and may your aspirations be fulfilled and approves of his plan of going to Chorwad in Saurashtra; vide Letter to H. S. L. Polak, 23 9 1909 Then on April 28 of the same year, he writes to Purshottams wife Vijay at her Chorwad address.
('67', 11, 9, 25, 20494) Evidently by that date Purshottam and Vijaya had got married.
('67', 11, 9, 26, 20556) The reference to his happy decision.
('67', 11, 9, 27, 20593) presumably the decision to marry, suggests that this was written before his marriage to Vijaya.

('67', 12, 2, 5, 20888) Even if I go out, it will be only for a few days.
('67', 12, 2, 6, 20938) Only the visit to Borsad depends on Vallabhbhais desire.
('67', 12, 2, 7, 20995) Even if I have to go, it will be after the 15th of May.
('67', 12, 2, 8, 21051) Yes, the money received from Tharparkar has been disbursed exactly as you have stated.
('67', 12, 2, 9, 21138) Draw it from some account.
('67', 12, 2, 10, 21165) I have already written to you about Mathew.
('67', 12, 2, 11, 21209) Titus has been relieved from Sabarmati.
('67', 12, 2, 12, 21249) Narahari has no trust at all in his ability.
('67', 12, 2, 13, 21294) I have called him here.
('67', 12, 2, 14, 21318) If he comes, I will keep him and watch him.
('67', 12, 2, 15, 21362) In any case you should go and look into his accounts.
('67', 12, 2, 16, 21416) Keshus letter was a clean one.
('67', 12, 2, 17, 21447) Give him Rs. 300 more.
('67', 12, 2, 18, 21470) But fix a limit now.

('67', 12, 2, 20, 21513) The suggestion I made in the letter to Jamna 1 regarding steam cooking deserves careful consideration.
('67', 12, 2, 21, 21616) Kanu will explain how we do it here.
('67', 12, 2, 22, 21653) The method is easy and results in considerable economy.
('67', 12, 2, 23, 21709) No new utensils are required.
('67', 12, 2, 24, 21739) Why should any bhatts come?
('67', 12, 2, 25, 21767) There should be no such class of professional cooks as there should be none of scavengers.
('67', 12, 2, 26, 21858) The idea that a cook should always be a Brahmin is born of ignorance.

('67', 13, 8, 16, 23024) It is obvious that she will be able to eat more there in proportion as she takes exercise.

('67', 16, 7, 16, 26369) RAMDAS, I have your letter.
('67', 16, 7, 17, 26397) You are very lucky, indeed.
('67', 16, 7, 18, 26425) I am glad that your last enterprise has come to nought.
('67', 16, 7, 19, 26481) It could not have continued.
('67', 16, 7, 20, 26510) The difference between business and service is that in the latter income is limited and in the former it is unlimited.
('67', 16, 7, 21, 26629) Business, of course, calls for hard work.
('67', 16, 7, 22, 26671) You should therefore take up a job and learn what you wish to learn.
('67', 16, 7, 23, 26740) You will acquire self confidence if you learn some trade.
('67', 16, 7, 24, 26798) If you take in a press, learn printing or composing.
('67', 16, 7, 25, 26851) Then there are of course the crafts such as tailoring, shoe making and carpentry.
('67', 16, 7, 26, 26933) The easiest are tailoring and shoe making.
('67', 16, 7, 27, 26976) Both involve only stitching.
('67', 16, 7, 28, 27005) After learning these crafts you may even do business in the filed.
('67', 16, 7, 29, 27072) Instead of hankering after money, you should be keen on learning.
('67', 16, 7, 30, 27138) Ba suggests that you should go to Amreli and serve under Ramjibhai.
('67', 16, 7, 31, 27206) I also would like Amreli provided that there too you learnt some craft.
('67', 16, 7, 32, 27278) I have been giving you this advice for many years.
('67', 16, 7, 33, 27329) You should become an expert in something.
('67', 16, 7, 34, 27371) Then alone will your worth be properly recognized.
('67', 16, 7, 35, 27422) If you become an expert, even if only as a barber, you will come to be respected.

('67', 18, 2, 6, 29061) If you do what I desire and succeed in that, it would be my success.
('67', 18, 2, 7, 29130) But that would be of no profit to you.

('67', 18, 5, 17, 29539) They lie buried in other papers.
('67', 18, 5, 18, 29572) I will look for them today.
('67', 18, 5, 19, 29600) If no paper is available there, it might perhaps be unnecessary to order new paper to be made.
('67', 18, 5, 20, 29695) Where such paper cannot be procured at all, I would not consider it right for a poor man to get it from outside and use it 1. That you are able to get milk is welcome news.

('67', 21, 2, 5, 32658) Pounded leaves is not the same thing as the juice of the leaves.
('67', 21, 2, 6, 32723) They are as different as polished rice is from unpolished rice.
('67', 21, 2, 7, 32787) The leaves should not be strained.
('67', 21, 2, 8, 32822) I used to strain the vegetables a little when I was taking vegetable juice.
('67', 21, 2, 9, 32898) That way you will not get the feeling of heat.

('67', 21, 2, 13, 33081) The quantity of the milk cannot be increased too soon.
('67', 21, 2, 14, 33136) If green vegetable is palatable you may take five tolas to begin with.
('67', 21, 2, 15, 33207) Once you are able to digest it you may increase the quantity by five tolas at a times, going up to 20 tolas.
('67', 21, 2, 16, 33316) This should be taken thrice.
('67', 21, 2, 17, 33345) You do get goats milk at 10.30 and fresh cows milk in the morning and evening.

('67', 22, 4, 5, 34216) If it was possible, for your sake, to send somebody to London I would do so.
('67', 22, 4, 6, 34293) But I see that it cannot be done at present.
('67', 22, 4, 7, 34338) Rajaji will not look at the proposal 1 nor would anyone else.
('67', 22, 4, 8, 34400) There never has been within living memory such unbending attitude on the part of the Government one sees now.
('67', 22, 4, 9, 34510) It is the naked sword that is being dangled before India at the present moment.
('67', 22, 4, 10, 34590) I regard it as a trial from above.
('67', 22, 4, 11, 34625) If we have real love, i.e., ahimsa in us, all will be well.
('67', 22, 4, 12, 34685) If we have not and we have used it merely as a cloak, the naked sword is well deserved.
('67', 22, 4, 13, 34773) Anyway the mentality being as I have described it, no one of the front rank think of going to England, so long as the policy persists.
('67', 22, 4, 14, 34908) I did read a paragraph about Sir Samuels illness.
('67', 22, 4, 15, 34958) But the reports did not give it any serious importance.

('67', 23, 6, 15, 36232) You have developed a liking for Kanti of which I hope he will prove worthy.
('67', 23, 6, 16, 36308) I would welcome the marriage of your daughter with Kanti, if he proves his worthiness when the time for marriage comes.
('67', 23, 6, 17, 36428) The interval must be one of sacred preparation on either side.
('67', 23, 6, 18, 36491) One thing I must beg of you.
('67', 23, 6, 19, 36520) The girl should know nothing of our intentions.
('67', 23, 6, 20, 36568) She must be free to make her choice when she grows to maturity.
('67', 23, 6, 21, 36632) I know that Kanti has been in frequent correspondence with you.
('67', 23, 6, 22, 36696) Nothing of it should be secret from Ramachandran.
('67', 23, 6, 23, 36746) Kanti will be guilty of unfaithfulness if he did anything in connection with the girl or held communication with you secretly from Ramachandran.
('67', 23, 6, 24, 36891) I could never forgive myself if any such thing happened.

('67', 24, 2, 3, 37270) May 1, 1935
('67', 24, 3, 4, 37282) MY DEAR RAMACHANDRAN,
('67', 24, 4, 5, 37304) I have deliberately refrained hitherto from replying to your letter regarding Kanti.
('67', 24, 4, 6, 37389) I am now able to give you the reply.
('67', 24, 4, 7, 37426) The girl should know nothing about our intentions till she grows to maturity.
('67', 24, 4, 8, 37504) Kanti may harbour and the age of maturity hold any communication with her directly or indirectly [sic].
('67', 24, 4, 9, 37608) He may write as he is already writing to your sister but nothing of what he writes should be secret from you.
('67', 24, 4, 10, 37718) All his letters should be accessible to you if and whenever you desire.
('67', 24, 4, 11, 37790) Each has to be worthy of the other.
('67', 24, 4, 12, 37826) If, therefore, the girl has to be prepared for Kanti, Kanti has to prepare himself for being worthy of her and you.
('67', 24, 4, 13, 37942) If when the time for marriage comes, Kanti is found not to have progressed along the right lines, you are free to withhold the girl from his assuming of course that when she comes to maturity, she will listen to you.
('67', 24, 4, 14, 38159) For you and me the proposed union can be tolerated only if it becomes a pattern for others to copy.
('67', 24, 4, 15, 38259) It must therefore be developed in the spirit of service.
('67', 24, 4, 16, 38316) Development along this line must mean greater simplicity, greater self abnegation, greater advance towards truth and ahimsa, uttermost brahmacharya in thought and word and deed.
('67', 24, 4, 17, 38494) The contemplation of the girl must mean to Kanti exclusion of every other woman from his thought for the gratification of his sexual impulse.
('67', 24, 4, 18, 38636) If these conditions are fulfilled, I should welcome the union.
('67', 24, 4, 19, 38699) There is nothing wrong, as it seems to me, from the inception.
('67', 24, 4, 20, 38762) Kanti honestly confessed as soon as he felt drawn to the girl.
('67', 24, 4, 21, 38825) His subsequent conduct too has appeared to me to have been free from reproach, This will be seen by Kanti who will send it to you.
('67', 24, 4, 22, 38956) If there is anything in my letter of which you disapprove please let me know, I am asking Kanti to send a copy of this to Devdas.
('67', 24, 4, 23, 39086) Of course Mahadev will see this as also Harilal.

('67', 26, 3, 5, 40753) Why are you making yourself miserable?
('67', 26, 3, 6, 40792) When you want to die a heroic death and tread the path of the brave, how can you show such weakness of heart?
('67', 26, 3, 7, 40902) You must display heroism under all conditions.

('67', 26, 3, 9, 41028) She is a true heroine who does not forget God in pain, shows a concern for the nurse, is content with whatever nursing she gets, takes the least amount of service and is always prepared to embrace death.
('67', 26, 3, 10, 41232) Being roused to battle and die is heroism of an inferior kind.
('67', 26, 3, 11, 41295) I am sending a telegram to Dr. Roy today.

('67', 27, 9, 12, 42509) [Before May 2, 1935] 1
('67', 27, 10, 13, 42532) The only reason for inviting me to write a Foreword to a literary work such as Shri Munshis can be that I am called Mahatma.
('67', 27, 10, 14, 42657) I can make no literary pretensions.
('67', 27, 10, 15, 42693) My acquaintance with Gujarati and for that matter any literature, is, for no fault of mine, next to nothing.
('67', 27, 10, 16, 42802) Having led a life of intense action since early youth I have had no opportunity of reading except in prisons whether in South Africa or in India.
('67', 27, 10, 17, 42948) Shri Munshis survey of Gujarati literature has made fascinating reading for me.
('67', 27, 10, 18, 43028) His miniature pen portraits of writers give one a fair introduction to their writings.
('67', 27, 10, 19, 43115) Shri Munshis estimate of our literary achievement appears to me to be very faithful.
('67', 27, 10, 20, 43200) The survey naturally confines itself to the language understood and spoken by the middle class.
('67', 27, 10, 21, 43296) Commercially minded and self satisfied, their language has naturally been effeminate and sensuous.
('67', 27, 10, 22, 43395) Of the language of the people we know next to nothing.
('67', 27, 10, 23, 43450) We hardly understand their speech.
('67', 27, 10, 24, 43485) The gulf between them and us, the middle class, is so great that we do not know them and they know still less of what we think and speak.
('67', 27, 10, 25, 43623) The dignified persistence of Shri Devendra Satyarthi, a writer whom I do not remember to have ever met, has made me peep into his

('67', 28, 0, 1, 43793) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 29
('67', 28, 1, 2, 43840) remarkable collection of folk songs of the provinces he has been travelling in.
('67', 28, 1, 3, 43920) They are the literature of the people.
('67', 28, 1, 4, 43959) The middle classes of the provinces to which the songs belong are untouched by them, even as we of Gujarat are untouched by the songs of folk, i.e., the language of the masses of Gujarat.
('67', 28, 1, 5, 44147) Meghani of the Saurashtra school has done folklore research in Kathiawar.
('67', 28, 1, 6, 44221) His researches show the gulf that exists between the language of the people and ours.
('67', 28, 2, 7, 44307) But the folklore belongs to an order of things that is passing away, if it has not already done so.
('67', 28, 2, 8, 44407) There is an awakening among the masses.
('67', 28, 2, 9, 44447) They have begun not with thought but with action, as I suppose they always do.
('67', 28, 2, 10, 44526) Their language has yet to take definite shape.
('67', 28, 2, 11, 44573) It is to be found somewhat, but only somewhat, in the newspapers, not in books.
('67', 28, 2, 12, 44653) Shri Munshi's work therefore may be said to have only commenced with the volume before me.
('67', 28, 2, 13, 44744) It was necessary.
('67', 28, 2, 14, 44762) But he has to continue the work so well begun.
('67', 28, 2, 15, 44809) He has the requisite passion for his work.
('67', 28, 2, 16, 44852) If he has health, he will now go direct to the people and find out what they are thinking, and he will give expression to their thoughts.
('67', 28, 2, 17, 44990) The unquestionable poverty of Gujarati is a token of the poverty of the people.
('67', 28, 2, 18, 45070) But no language is really poor.
('67', 28, 2, 19, 45102) We have hardly had time to speak since we have begun to act.
('67', 28, 2, 20, 45163) Gujarat like the rest of India is brooding.
('67', 28, 2, 21, 45207) The language is shaping itself.
('67', 28, 2, 22, 45239) There is enough work awaiting writers like our author.
('67', 28, 2, 23, 45294) Munshi has alluded to Parsi Gujarati.
('67', 28, 2, 24, 45332) So there is.
('67', 28, 2, 25, 45345) It is unfortunate that there is Parsi Gujarati.
('67', 28, 2, 26, 45393) It is confined to novels and stories of the shilling shocker style.
('67', 28, 2, 27, 45461) They are meant merely for passing the idle hour.
('67', 28, 2, 28, 45510) The language is tortured out of shape.
('67', 28, 2, 29, 45549) And just as there is Parsi Gujarati there is also Muslim Gujarati though on a much humbler scale.
('67', 28, 2, 30, 45647) It is impossible to ignore these two streams.
('67', 28, 2, 31, 45693) They are not wells of Gujarati undefiled.
('67', 28, 2, 32, 45735) But no reviewer of Gujarati literature can afford to ignore the existence of works which hundreds, if not thousands, of Parsis and Muslims read and by which, maybe, even shape part of their conduct.

('67', 30, 7, 10, 48040) May 3, 1935
('67', 30, 8, 11, 48052) PREMA, I got your letter just now.
('67', 30, 8, 12, 48087) All the descriptions are beautiful.
('67', 30, 8, 13, 48123) You will be able to manage most of the things.
('67', 30, 8, 14, 48170) 2 The Koran has been translated into Urdu.
('67', 30, 8, 15, 48213) You should go through the translation.
('67', 30, 8, 16, 48252) You will then be able to get into its spirit.
('67', 30, 8, 17, 48298) You should also go through the Urdu readers.
('67', 30, 8, 18, 48343) They have been published from the Punjab.
('67', 30, 8, 19, 48385) Some may have been published from Hyderabad, too.
('67', 30, 8, 20, 48435) I understand about straining oil.
('67', 30, 8, 21, 48469) We have an indigenous oil press here.
('67', 30, 8, 22, 48507) But your method may perhaps be useful in pressing small quantities.
('67', 30, 8, 23, 48575) I will try it.
('67', 30, 8, 24, 48590) Probably I may have to leave on the 6th for Borsad.
('67', 30, 8, 25, 48642) I intend to return on the 17th.
('67', 30, 8, 26, 48674) I shall be spending a few hours on the way in Bombay, which will be on the 16th.
('67', 30, 8, 27, 48755) 3 If this programme is finalized, you will be able to know about it from the newspapers also.

('67', 31, 2, 3, 49268) May 3, 1935
('67', 31, 3, 4, 49280) BHAI PURUSHOTTAMDAS 1,
('67', 31, 4, 5, 49303) I saw your letter only today.
('67', 31, 4, 6, 49333) I returned from Ahmedabad this very day.
('67', 31, 4, 7, 49374) I went through the article sent by you.
('67', 31, 4, 8, 49414) The tears shed by the author towards the end are improper.
('67', 31, 4, 9, 49473) If the Government is awake why cannot we wake up?
('67', 31, 4, 10, 49523) It is for persons like you to wake the people up.
('67', 31, 4, 11, 49573) If, however, you also look to others, won't it be like the sea losing its salt and then bemoaning the fact?
('67', 31, 4, 12, 49681) Wake up yourself, show the way and others will follow.
('67', 31, 4, 13, 49736) Exchange and similar issues are matters of high finance.
('67', 31, 4, 14, 49793) What can the Congress do about them?
('67', 31, 4, 15, 49830) Those who know the subject do not, cannot, join the Congress.
('67', 31, 4, 16, 49892) Those who are in the Congress naturally do not know much about such matters.
('67', 31, 4, 17, 49969) This is a work for experts on finance.
('67', 31, 4, 18, 50008) They should set up a special body for that purpose and take the necessary steps.
('67', 31, 4, 19, 50089) The author of the article says that if India had been awake when the country went off the gold standard, the step would not have been taken.
('67', 31, 4, 20, 50230) What ought to have been done to prevent it?
('67', 31, 4, 21, 50274) What can we do today so that the right policy will be followed?
('67', 31, 4, 22, 50338) Do you think there is any connection between this problem and that of village industries?
('67', 31, 4, 23, 50428) Wont the villagers have to learn to be clean, irrespective of whether or not the right policy is followed; and know what proper diet is?
('67', 31, 4, 24, 50565) If the revival of [Village] industries is desirable, shouldnt it be carried out?
('67', 31, 4, 25, 50646) Do you think carrying it out will interfere with currency agitation?
('67', 31, 4, 26, 50715) Hardly any currency experts have joined in it.
('67', 31, 4, 27, 50762) And those who have joined can still continue working in the other field.
('67', 31, 4, 28, 50835) What is the remedy if finance experts do not take up this burden?
('67', 31, 4, 29, 50901) Who will wake them up?
('67', 31, 4, 30, 50924) I myself do not know enough about the subject to be able to do so.
('67', 31, 4, 31, 50991) I understand about cement.
('67', 31, 4, 32, 51018) I am writing to Bapa 2 asking him to send an application.

('67', 32, 3, 4, 51399) I am writing to Dr. Gopichand.
('67', 32, 3, 5, 51430) Your account here shows a balance of Rs. 53. Rs. 42 is your railway fare.
('67', 32, 3, 6, 51504) But I dont remember the details.
('67', 32, 3, 7, 51537) My advice is that you may leave Rs. 100 as a standing account.

('67', 32, 6, 10, 51681) 57. TWO GOOD RESOLUTIONS
('67', 32, 7, 11, 51706) The Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, recently held at Indore, passed some useful resolutions.
('67', 32, 7, 12, 51791) Among them was one giving a definition of Hindi, and another expressing the opinion that all the languages that had descended from or had been largely influenced by Sanskrit should be written in the Devanagari script.
('67', 32, 8, 13, 52009) The first resolution is designed to emphasize the fact that Hindi does not supplant the provincial languages, that it supplements them, and that it extends the knowledge and usefulness of the speaker as an all India worker.
('67', 32, 8, 14, 52233) By recognizing the fact that the language written in the Urdu script but understood both by Mussalmans and Hindus is also Hindi, the Sammelan disarms the suspicion that it has any design upon the Urdu script.
('67', 32, 8, 15, 52442) The authorized script of the Sammelan still remains Devanagari.
('67', 32, 8, 16, 52506) The propagation of the Devanagari script among the Hindus of the Punjab, as elsewhere, will still continue.
('67', 32, 8, 17, 52614) The resolution in no way detracts from the value of the Devanagari script.
('67', 32, 8, 18, 52689) It recognizes the right of Mussalmans to write the language in the Urdu script as they have done hitherto.
('67', 32, 8, 19, 52796) In order to give practical effect to the second resolution, a committee was appointed with Kakasaheb Kalelkar as Chairman and Convener, to explore the possibility of such introduction and to make
('67', 32, 9, 20, 52992) 1 This was a postscript to Mahadev Desais letter to the addressee informing him of a bookshop at Lahore and advising him on behalf of Gandhiji to purchase the books he needed through Dr. Gopichand Bhargava so as to get a discount on the price.
('67', 33, 0, 1, 53236) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('67', 33, 1, 2, 53277) such changes and additions in the Devanagri script as may be necessary to make it easier to write and more perfect than it is so as to represent the sounds not expressed by the existing letters.
('67', 33, 2, 3, 53472) Such a change is necessary if interprovincial contacts are to increase and if Hindi is to be the medium of communication between provinces.
('67', 33, 2, 4, 53612) The second was ever an accepted proposition for the past twenty five years with those who subscribe to the creed of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan.
('67', 33, 2, 5, 53756) The question of script has often been discussed but never seriously tackled.
('67', 33, 2, 6, 53833) And yet it seems to be a natural corollary to the first proposition.
('67', 33, 2, 7, 53902) Learning sister languages becomes incredibly simple and easy.
('67', 33, 2, 8, 53964) Gitanjali, written in the Bengali script, is a sealed book to everyone except the Bengalis.
('67', 33, 2, 9, 54056) It is almost an open book when it is written in the Devanagari script.
('67', 33, 2, 10, 54127) There is in it a vast number of words derived from Sanskrit and easily understood by the people of the other provinces.
('67', 33, 2, 11, 54247) Everyone can test the truth of this statement.
('67', 33, 2, 12, 54294) We ought not unnecessarily to tax the future generations with the trouble of having to learn different scripts.
('67', 33, 2, 13, 54406) It is cruel to require a person desiring to learn Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kanarese, Oriya and Bengali to learn six scripts, besides Devanagari, let alone the Urdu script if he would know what the Muslim brethren are saying and doing through their writings.
('67', 33, 2, 14, 54665) I have not presented an ambitious programme for a lover of his country or humanity.
('67', 33, 2, 15, 54749) Today the impenetrable barrier of different scripts has made the learning of sister languages and the learning of Hindi by the sister provinces a needlessly heavy task.
('67', 33, 2, 16, 54918) It will be for Kakasahebs committee on the one hand to educate and canvass public opinion in favour of the reform, and on the other to demonstrate by practical application its great utility in saving the time and energy of those who would learn Hindi or the provincial languages.
('67', 33, 2, 17, 55198) Let no one run away with the idea that the reform will diminish the importance of the provincial languages.
('67', 33, 2, 18, 55306) Indeed it can only enrich them even as the adoption of a common script has enriched the languages of Europe by making intercourse between its provinces easy.

('67', 34, 1, 2, 55529) 58. HOW TO DOUBLE INCOME
('67', 34, 2, 3, 55554) Though the spinning movement has been going on for the past seventeen years, and though it is giving a small but steady income to at least 1,20,000 women from year to year, the deplorable ignorance of the science of spinning on the part of workers keeps the income lower than it need be.
('67', 34, 2, 4, 55842) Bad cotton, badly carded and spun on a rickety wheel without regard to the revolutions of the spindle, results in a low output.
('67', 34, 2, 5, 55970) Attention to details can easily double the output and therefore the income.
('67', 34, 2, 6, 56046) If cotton is carefully picked, hand ginned and well carded, there will be an increased output and improvement in the strength and evenness of yarn.
('67', 34, 2, 7, 56194) Speed, strength, evenness and count of yarn depend perhaps most upon the number of revolutions of the spindle, i.e., the turns a spindle makes for every turn of the wheel.
('67', 34, 2, 8, 56366) The calculation is easily made by drawing a vertical line on the spindle disc and turning the wheel so slowly as to enable one easily to count the turns of the spindle.
('67', 34, 2, 9, 56535) A spindle should never have less than one hundred revolutions against one of the wheels.
('67', 34, 2, 10, 56624) But Shri Shankerlal Banker reports that during his tour be noticed spindles performing only thirty five revolutions.
('67', 34, 2, 11, 56741) No wonder if the output is miserably low and the yarn weak and fluffy.
('67', 34, 2, 12, 56812) The way to increase the revolutions of a spindle is to decrease the diameter of the sari which keeps the mal in its place.
('67', 34, 2, 13, 56935) Local workers should examine every wheel in their place and make the necessary changes in the spindle and other parts, wherever necessary.
('67', 34, 2, 14, 57074) It may be that in the end the takli may be found to be the best instrument of yarn production.
('67', 34, 2, 15, 57169) It requires the least attention, and the new method of takli spinning gives an average speed of 200 rounds, i.e., 266 yards of yarn, and as much as 440 rounds per hour.

('67', 36, 2, 3, 58557) May 4, 1935
('67', 36, 4, 4, 58569) Kanu had written as foolish a letter as you have done, and I hope that your doubt will be resolved as quickly as his was.
('67', 36, 4, 5, 58691) Man daily dies a living death and cries when real death comes.
('67', 36, 4, 6, 58754) Man himself is responsible for being miserable.
('67', 36, 4, 7, 58802) I do not want to bury either of you here.
('67', 36, 4, 8, 58844) This time, too, I cannot understand why Mahadev had to answer your letter.
('67', 36, 4, 9, 58919) I have deliberately decided not to give either of you charge of the kitchen, so that I might be able to take one of you with me when I go on a real tour.
('67', 36, 4, 10, 59073) I may not be able to take both of you, though I am thinking of taking both.
('67', 36, 4, 11, 59149) I am sure you will both understand, if owing to chance or exigencies of work I am not able to do as I wish.
('67', 36, 4, 12, 59257) This year I do not want to travel at all.
('67', 36, 4, 13, 59299) I wish to put things here in order.
('67', 36, 4, 14, 59335) I will go on tour next year if I am alivealive in both senses.
('67', 36, 4, 15, 59398) For isnt imprisonment also a kind of death?
('67', 36, 4, 16, 59442) In English they call it civil death, that is, death in the eyes of law.
('67', 36, 4, 17, 59514) Isnt that always there as my lot?
('67', 36, 4, 18, 59548) I reprimanded Bal, just as I reprimanded you.
('67', 36, 4, 19, 59594) He wanted me to write, and so gets letters from me.
('67', 36, 4, 20, 59646) You in your letter kept me free from the obligation of replying and, therefore, I write less often to you.
('67', 36, 4, 21, 59753) How often do I write to Devdas?
('67', 36, 4, 22, 59785) I write according to the need of the other persons.
('67', 36, 4, 23, 59837) Do you know the meaning of your statement that my words leave you dumbfounded?
('67', 36, 4, 24, 59916) It means that you feel yourself miles away from me.
('67', 36, 4, 25, 59968) Is it your fault or mine that you could not recognize the love behind my harsh words?
('67', 36, 4, 26, 60054) As a votary of ahimsa, I should believe it to be mine, but as a father I would say it was yours.
('67', 36, 4, 27, 60151) How strange it is that I should have to weigh my words and restrain my language when speaking to you lest you feel offended?
('67', 36, 4, 28, 60276) From the beginning you have had a tendency to rudeness and bad manners.
('67', 36, 4, 29, 60348) You have tried hard to overcome it and succeeded in a great measure, yet some traces are still left.
('67', 36, 4, 30, 60449) There is nothing of that kind in this letter to me.
('67', 36, 4, 31, 60501) But there was something of it on that day on the terrace.
('67', 36, 4, 32, 60559) I had pacified myself of course.
('67', 36, 4, 33, 60592) It is strange that Harilal should think you have lost your value in my eyes.
('67', 36, 4, 34, 60669) I am a little hurt, too, for he knows very well that you mean much to me.
('67', 36, 4, 35, 60743) For myself, I feel that I am tending you carefully like a flower.
('67', 36, 4, 36, 60809) Your work has
('67', 37, 0, 1, 60823) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('67', 37, 1, 2, 60864) given me nothing but satisfaction.
('67', 37, 1, 3, 60899) Your intelligence is impressed on your face.
('67', 37, 1, 4, 60944) I have been trying to argue with Devdas that he is making some mistake.
('67', 37, 1, 5, 61016) What does the letter also which I have written to Ramachandran prove?
('67', 37, 1, 6, 61086) Let me assure you that you really mean a great deal to me.
('67', 37, 1, 7, 61145) It is a matter of shame for both of us that you hesitate to come to me.
('67', 37, 1, 8, 61217) There is no reason whatever for this.
('67', 37, 1, 9, 61255) Cardamom, oil or toothpaste, none of the three is necessary.
('67', 37, 1, 10, 61316) The ashes of burnt cowdung, powdered fine like flour and mixed with salt, and a neem twig will keep the teeth very clean.
('67', 37, 1, 11, 61438) Coconut oil is a perfect hair oil.
('67', 37, 1, 12, 61473) It is improved still further by the addition of a few drops of lime juice.
('67', 37, 1, 13, 61548) Instead of cardamom, the neem leaf is a fine mouth purifier and one that is used by the village people.
('67', 37, 1, 14, 61652) In your relations with the girl 1 whom you wish to marry, you will have to cultivate the virtues of Bharata.
('67', 37, 1, 15, 61761) I hope that your marriage will provide an example of self control.
('67', 37, 1, 16, 61828) I wish that you should feel no discontent whatever, not even about studies.
('67', 37, 1, 17, 61904) If you can endure the hardships of life in this place, you will become a man.
('67', 37, 1, 18, 61982) Even otherwise, however, you will surely grow up to be a successful man of the world.

('67', 38, 5, 27, 64048) Still, I do wish that his marriage should be a happy one.
('67', 38, 5, 28, 64106) I will have no objection, on the contrary I would like it, if he earns a living by engaging himself in one of our manifold activites.

('67', 42, 4, 7, 69919) AVADHESH, Tulsidas himself has said that the name of Rama is greater than Rama, meaning that Rama, who transcends the body, is formless and nameless and is greater than Rama in body.
('67', 42, 4, 8, 70102) Rama was certainly the son of Dasharatha and the husband of Sita, but He is also the Purushottama of our imagination because the Unmanifest is not different from the Manifest.
('67', 42, 4, 9, 70278) Everything is a manifestation of the Unmanifest.
('67', 42, 4, 10, 70327) I dont insist on the name Rama, it might be Omkar or Krishna, or Ishwar.
('67', 42, 4, 11, 70400) I do get angry, but I feel angry with myself for it.
('67', 42, 4, 12, 70453) Full conquest of anger is possible only through self realization.

('67', 44, 10, 16, 73073) NARANDAS,
('67', 44, 11, 17, 73083) Enclosed please find a letter from Bhagwanji 2. Go to help him or send someone else.
('67', 44, 11, 18, 73168) There is nothing great in going to nearby villages.
('67', 44, 11, 19, 73220) Go and see him.
('67', 44, 11, 20, 73236) He is a simple man and wants to do a lot.
('67', 44, 11, 21, 73278) If he volunteers to devote some time to the school, you may accept his services.
('67', 44, 11, 22, 73359) However, if your experience is to the contrary, then leave it.
('67', 44, 11, 23, 73422) A letter for Lilavati is enclosed.
('67', 44, 11, 24, 73457) What is the news about Keshu?

('67', 45, 7, 12, 74092) How can the Harijan Ashram be run without a cow?
('67', 45, 7, 13, 74141) I think we should keep a cow and a bull in the Ashram and hand over the other cattle to the pinjrapole 1. Think over what should be done about Bidaj.
('67', 45, 7, 14, 74291) If it is at all possible do hand over the cattle to Ramjibhai without consulting me, but with the consent of the Trustees.

('67', 46, 3, 5, 75011) For that the ekadash vrat 1 that we ponder upon daily is essential.
('67', 46, 3, 6, 75079) That is why there lies some difficulty in your way at present.
('67', 46, 3, 7, 75142) Discharging of family debts has, to a certain extent, become obligatory for you.
('67', 46, 3, 8, 75223) If it can be done easily it may be done.
('67', 46, 3, 9, 75264) Even for this you need to observe the pancha mahavrat 2. I hope that you will stick to them with a cheerful spirit.
('67', 46, 3, 10, 75380) You should suspend your studies for a year and concentrate on building up your health and refreshing your mind.

('67', 46, 9, 16, 75624) I read your letter to Chandrashankar.
('67', 46, 9, 17, 75662) From which letter of mine did you draw that conclusion?
('67', 46, 9, 18, 75718) You desire that the sum of Rs. 3,742 3 8 should be written off.
('67', 46, 9, 19, 75782) If that is done Harijan will go bankrupt.
('67', 46, 9, 20, 75824) Do you expect Harijan to make a gift of it to Kodambakam?
('67', 46, 9, 21, 75882) So far as I remember, we had a discussion about the supplement too.
('67', 46, 9, 22, 75950) At one time you were ready to offer monetary help so that Harijan might be continued.
('67', 46, 9, 23, 76036) Do you wish now to put a burden upon it?
('67', 46, 9, 24, 76077) You may certainly do so if and when it makes a profit and has some savings.
('67', 46, 9, 25, 76153) If you put Harijan to a loss of Rs. 4,000, it will have to be stopped.
('67', 46, 9, 26, 76224) I, however, fully approve of your disinclination to write to anybody to enlist subscribers.
('67', 46, 9, 27, 76316) People will subscribe to it if it has any worth.
('67', 46, 9, 28, 76365) Otherwise let it die.

('67', 47, 1, 2, 76626) 80. INTERVIEW TO A MISSIONARY NURSE 1
('67', 47, 2, 3, 76664) [Before May 11,1935]
('67', 47, 3, 4, 76685) [NURSE:] You have the reputation of never being angry.
('67', 47, 3, 5, 76740) Is that true?
('67', 47, 3, 6, 76754) [GANDHIJI:] It is not that I do not get angry.
('67', 47, 3, 7, 76801) I do not give vent to anger.
('67', 47, 3, 8, 76830) I cultivate the quality of patience as angerlessness, and generally speaking I succeed.
('67', 47, 3, 9, 76918) But I only control my anger when it comes.
('67', 47, 3, 10, 76961) How I find it possible to control it would be a useless question, for it is a habit that everyone must cultivate and must succeed in forming by constant practice.
('67', 47, 4, 11, 77124) When did you come to experience this great love for the poor?
('67', 47, 4, 12, 77186) Could you tell me the period or the occasion?
('67', 47, 4, 13, 77232) I have always had a love for the poor all my life and in abundance.
('67', 47, 4, 14, 77300) I could cite illustration after illustration from my past life to show that it was something innate in me.
('67', 47, 4, 15, 77407) I have never felt that there was any difference between the poor and me.
('67', 47, 4, 16, 77480) I have always felt toward them as my own kith and kin.
('67', 47, 5, 17, 77535) Dont you have anything like antipathy for filth and dirt?
('67', 47, 5, 18, 77593) I have no antipathy against dirty people but I have a horror of dirt.
('67', 47, 5, 19, 77663) I should not eat out of a dirty plate nor touch a dirty spoon or kerchief.
('67', 47, 5, 20, 77738) But I believe in removing dirt to its proper place, where it ceases to be dirt.
('67', 47, 6, 21, 77818) I do feel that whilst it is bad to encourage begging, I will not send away a beggar without offering him work and food.
('67', 47, 6, 22, 77938) If he will not work, I should let him go without food.
('67', 47, 6, 23, 77993) Those who are physically disabled like the halt and the maimed and the blind have got to be supported by the State.
('67', 47, 6, 24, 78109) There is, however, a lot of fraud going on under cover of pretended blindness or even genuine blindness.
('67', 47, 6, 25, 78214) So many blind have become rich because of ill gotten gains.
('67', 47, 6, 26, 78274) It would be a good thing if they were taken to an asylum, rather than to be exposed to this temptation.
('67', 47, 7, 27, 78378) Would you prevent missionaries coming to India in order to baptize?
('67', 47, 7, 28, 78446) Who am I to prevent them?
('67', 47, 7, 29, 78472) If I had power and could legislate, I should certainly stop all proselytizing.
('67', 47, 7, 30, 78551) It is the cause of much avoidable conflict between classes and unnecessary heart burning
('67', 47, 8, 31, 78640) 1 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 47, 8, 32, 78695) 2 Here Mahadev Desai had explained that the visitor next discussed the question of beggary.

('67', 48, 1, 2, 78834) among missionaries.
('67', 48, 1, 3, 78854) But I should welcome people of any nationality if they came to serve here for the sake of service.
('67', 48, 1, 4, 78953) In Hindu households the advent of a missionary has meant the disruption of the family coming in the wake of change of dress, manners, language, food and drink.
('67', 48, 2, 5, 79113) Is it not the old conception you are referring to?
('67', 48, 2, 6, 79164) No such thing is now associated with proselytization.
('67', 48, 2, 7, 79218) The outward condition has perhaps changed but the inward mostly remains.
('67', 48, 2, 8, 79291) Vilification of Hindu religion, though subdued, is there.
('67', 48, 2, 9, 79349) If there was a radical change in the missionaries outlook, would Murdochs books be allowed to be sold in mission depots?
('67', 48, 2, 10, 79470) Are those books prohibited by missionary societies?
('67', 48, 2, 11, 79522) There is nothing but vilification of Hinduism in those books.
('67', 48, 2, 12, 79584) You talk of the conception being no longer there.
('67', 48, 2, 13, 79634) Only the other day a missionary descended on a famine area withmoney in his pocket, distributed it among the famine stricken, converted them to his fold, took charge of their temple and demolished it.
('67', 48, 2, 14, 79835) This is outrageous.
('67', 48, 2, 15, 79855) The temple could not belong to the converted Hindus, and it could not belong to the Christian missionary.
('67', 48, 2, 16, 79961) But this friend goes and gets it demolished at the hands of the very men who only a little while ago believed that God was there.
('67', 48, 3, 17, 80091) But, Mr. Gandhi, why do you object to proselytization as such?
('67', 48, 3, 18, 80154) Is not there enough in the Bible to authorize us to invite people to a better way of life?
('67', 48, 3, 19, 80245) Oh yes, but it does not mean that they should be made members of the Church.
('67', 48, 3, 20, 80322) If you interpret your texts in the way you seem to do, you straight away condemn a large part of humanity unless it believes as you do.
('67', 48, 3, 21, 80458) If Jesus came to earth again, he would disown many things that are being done in the name of Christianity.
('67', 48, 3, 22, 80565) It is not he who says Lord, Lord that is a Christian, but He that doeth the will of the Lord that is a true Christian.
('67', 48, 3, 23, 80684) And cannot he who has not heard the name of Jesus Christ do the will of the Lord?

('67', 49, 1, 2, 80827) 81. GROSS ILL TREATMENT
('67', 49, 2, 3, 80851) I was working in a cheri under the auspices of the Harijan Sevak Sangh for a period of about four months.
('67', 49, 2, 4, 80957) A Harijan was expelled from the cheri, before I began Harijan work in the village, on account of his moral delinquencies.
('67', 49, 2, 5, 81079) The said Harijan once returned to visit his son studying in our school.
('67', 49, 2, 6, 81151) I allowed him to stop with me for the purpose.
('67', 49, 2, 7, 81198) He was resting in the school shed on the particular night.
('67', 49, 2, 8, 81257) In my absence, a party consisting of five persons belonging to the Harijan class who were the near relatives of the woman seduced, along with a few others of the so called castemen, took him out and beat him severely for the old offence of seducing a married woman, and drove him out of the shed.
('67', 49, 2, 9, 81554) Immediately I learnt of the incident, I approached the persons who had taken the law into their own hands and protested against the maltreatment and demanded the re admission of the Harijan into the cheri.
('67', 49, 2, 10, 81760) This was refused.
('67', 49, 2, 11, 81778) Therefore, I have withdrawn myself from the village.
('67', 49, 2, 12, 81831) The foregoing is a much condensed summary of a long letter.
('67', 49, 2, 13, 81891) I do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement.
('67', 49, 2, 14, 81941) But if the facts are as stated, surely it was wrong altogether to beat the Harijan as he appears to have been beaten.
('67', 49, 2, 15, 82059) If he had committed any crime, he should have been prosecuted.
('67', 49, 2, 16, 82122) But no one had any right to take the law into his own hands.
('67', 49, 2, 17, 82183) The correspondent was right in retiring from the cheri which was not prepared to do simple justice.
('67', 49, 2, 18, 82283) I hope that the matter was brought to the notice of the local Sangh and that the latter had tried to secure fair treatment for the Harijan concerned.
('67', 49, 2, 19, 82433) The whole affair is one for careful investigation.
('67', 49, 2, 20, 82484) I fear that such cases are frequent enough.
('67', 49, 2, 21, 82528) It is up to Harijan sevaks on the one hand to afford protection to the injured and on the other to awaken their sense of morality where it is lacking.
('67', 49, 2, 22, 82679) The offenders do not belong to any particular class.
('67', 49, 2, 23, 82732) All sections are tarred with the same brush.
('67', 49, 2, 24, 82777) Only those workers who have proved their worth and are above reproach will be able to create any impression at all on the delinquents.

('67', 49, 4, 26, 82931) 82. WELLS FOR HARIJANS
('67', 49, 5, 27, 82954) The Government of Bombay are to be congratulated upon their decision to build wells for Harijans in the Presidency of Bombay.
('67', 49, 5, 28, 83080) The sum set apart is a trifle for the work to be done.
('67', 49, 5, 29, 83135) As is well known, wells have been constructed for Harijans for years past in Gujarat by
('67', 50, 0, 1, 83223) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 51
('67', 50, 1, 2, 83270) the late Anti untouchability Board set up by the Congress, and since 1932 by the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('67', 50, 1, 3, 83372) The latter has an extensive programme of well building for Harijans, and Sjt.
('67', 50, 1, 4, 83450) Juthabhai, a quiet and great worker, has made up his mind to devote his attention to this noble humanitarian work.
('67', 50, 1, 5, 83565) It is greatly to be desired that in this work there would be perfect co ordination between the various agencies working towards the same end.
('67', 50, 1, 6, 83707) If co operative effort is not possible, there may be at least a division of labour and areas.
('67', 50, 1, 7, 83801) Whatever is done, the end should be quick work, good work and cheapest cost.
('67', 50, 1, 8, 83878) The last can be satisfied only if there is unskilled voluntary labour forthcoming either on the part of Harijan Hindus or savarna Hindus or both.

('67', 50, 3, 10, 84043) 83. VILLAGE WORKERS QUESTIONS
('67', 50, 4, 11, 84073) A village worker writes:
('67', 50, 5, 12, 84098) 1. I am working in a small village of a hundred houses.
('67', 50, 5, 13, 84154) You have said that attention to sanitation and hygiene should precede medical relief.
('67', 50, 5, 14, 84240) But what is a worker to do when a villager suffering from fever seeks aid?
('67', 50, 5, 15, 84315) I have been hitherto advising them to use indigenous herbs obtainable in the village bazaar.
('67', 50, 5, 16, 84408) 2. What is to be done with the night soil during the rains?
('67', 50, 5, 17, 84468) 3. Can night soil be used for all crops?
('67', 50, 5, 18, 84509) 4. What is the advantage of eating gur 1 in preference to sugar?
('67', 50, 5, 19, 84574) Where cases of fever, constipation or such common diseases come to village workers for help, they will certainly have to render such help as they can.
('67', 50, 5, 20, 84725) Where one is certain of the diagnosis, there is no doubt that the village bazaar medicine is the cheapest and best.
('67', 50, 5, 21, 84841) If one must stock drugs, castor oil, quinine and boiling water are the best medical agents.
('67', 50, 5, 22, 84933) Castor oil may be locally procurable.
('67', 50, 5, 23, 84971) The senna leaf may serve the same purpose.
('67', 50, 5, 24, 85014) Quinine one should use sparingly.
('67', 50, 5, 25, 85048) Every fever does not require quinine treatment.
('67', 50, 5, 26, 85096) Nor does every fever yield to quinine.
('67', 50, 5, 27, 85135) Most fevers will disappear after a fast or a semi fast.
('67', 50, 5, 28, 85191) Abstention from cereals, pulses and milk, and taking fruit juices or
('67', 50, 6, 29, 85260) 1 Jaggery
('67', 51, 0, 1, 85270) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('67', 51, 1, 2, 85311) boiling raisin water, even boiling gur water with fresh lemon juice or tamarind, is a semi fast.
('67', 51, 1, 3, 85408) Boiling water is a most powerful medical agent.
('67', 51, 1, 4, 85456) It may move the bowels, it will induce perspiration and therefore abate fever; it is the safest and cheapest disinfectant.
('67', 51, 1, 5, 85579) In every case where it is required to be drunk, the water must be allowed to cool till it is fairly bearable to the skin.
('67', 51, 1, 6, 85701) Boiling does not mean mere heating.
('67', 51, 1, 7, 85737) The water begins to bubble and evaporate after it is on the boil.
('67', 51, 1, 8, 85803) Where the workers do not know for certain what to do, they must allow the local vaidya to have full sway.
('67', 51, 1, 9, 85909) Where he is non existent or unreliable and the workers know a philanthropic doctor nearby, they may invoke his assistance.
('67', 51, 1, 10, 86032) But they will find that the most effective way of dealing even with disease is to attend to sanitation.
('67', 51, 1, 11, 86136) Let them remember that nature is the finest physician.
('67', 51, 1, 12, 86191) They may be sure that nature is repairing what man has damaged.
('67', 51, 1, 13, 86255) She appears to have become powerless when man continuously hampers her.
('67', 51, 1, 14, 86327) Then she sends deathher last and peremptory agent to destroy what is beyond repairand provides a fresh garment for the wearer.
('67', 51, 1, 15, 86454) Sanitary and hygienic workers are therefore the best helpers of the best physician every person has, whether he knows it or not.
('67', 51, 1, 16, 86583) 2. Even during the rains villagers should perform functions in places not trodden by man.
('67', 51, 1, 17, 86673) Faeces must be buried.
('67', 51, 1, 18, 86696) This is a most difficult question owing to the erroneous training of villagers.
('67', 51, 1, 19, 86776) In Sindi village we are trying to persuade the villagers not to use the streets, to go to the adjoining fields and to throw dry clean earth on their own evacuations.
('67', 51, 1, 20, 86942) After two months continuous labour and co operation of the municipal councillors and others, they have been good enough generally to cease to defile the streets.
('67', 51, 1, 21, 87104) They go to the fields which their owners have been good enough to open for such use.
('67', 51, 1, 22, 87189) But the villagers still obstinately refuse to throw earth on their own evacuations.
('67', 51, 1, 23, 87273) Surely it is bhangis work; it is sinful to look at faeces, more so to throw earth on them, they say.
('67', 51, 1, 24, 87374) They have been taught to believe so.
('67', 51, 1, 25, 87411) Workers have therefore not to write on a clean slate.
('67', 51, 1, 26, 87465) They have to rub off what is drawn into the slate with steel points.
('67', 51, 1, 27, 87534) But I know that if we have faith in our mission, if we have patience enough to persist in the work of daily morning scavenging and, above all, if we dont get irritated against the villagers, their prejudice will disappear as mist before the rays of the sun.

('67', 52, 1, 2, 87862) cannot yield to a few months object lessons.
('67', 52, 1, 3, 87907) We are preparing for the rains in Sindi.
('67', 52, 1, 4, 87948) Naturally the owners of fields must protect their crops.
('67', 52, 1, 5, 88005) They cannot, therefore, allow free access to their fields as many do now.
('67', 52, 1, 6, 88079) We have suggested to them that they should put up fences a few feet inside their boundaries, leaving the marks intact.
('67', 52, 1, 7, 88198) The few feet they may leave will by the end of the season be richly manured strips of their fields.
('67', 52, 1, 8, 88298) A time is coming when owners of fields will invite people to use them.
('67', 52, 1, 9, 88369) Every man constantly using a particular field leaves on it two rupees worth of manure in a year, if Dr. Fowlers estimate may be accepted.
('67', 52, 1, 10, 88507) The accuracy of the figure may be doubted.
('67', 52, 1, 11, 88550) The fact that a field benefits by the deposit of night soil in it is beyond doubt.
('67', 52, 1, 12, 88633) 3. No one has suggested that night soil may be administered to crops directly as manure.
('67', 52, 1, 13, 88722) What is meant is that addition of night soil to earth enriches it after a fixed time.
('67', 52, 1, 14, 88808) Night soil after being received into the earth has to undergo certain changes before the earth becomes fit for ploughing and cultivation.
('67', 52, 1, 15, 88946) The test in infallible.
('67', 52, 1, 16, 88970) Open up the earth after a stated time where you have buried night soil.
('67', 52, 1, 17, 89042) If you find that it is all sweet earth and no smell, no trace to faeces, the soil is fit to receive the seed.
('67', 52, 1, 18, 89152) I have used night soil in this manner for all manner of crops for the past thirty years with the greatest benefit.
('67', 52, 1, 19, 89267) 4. It is the universal testimony of experts that gur is more nutritious than sugar because it contains salts and vitamins which sugar does not contain.
('67', 52, 1, 20, 89419) As whole wheat meal is to fine flour, or unpolished rice to polished, so practically is gur to sugar.

('67', 52, 5, 25, 89605) I have gone through your note.
('67', 52, 5, 26, 89636) I believe in the system of barter.
('67', 52, 5, 27, 89671) It can apply only to village communities.
('67', 52, 5, 28, 89713) In its very nature it can work among small groups of men.
('67', 52, 5, 29, 89771) The village movement [if it] 1 succeeds, must result in villagers exchanging their goods.
('67', 52, 5, 30, 89861) It won't spread by preaching but it will by practising it wherever possible.

('67', 55, 4, 6, 92652) May 11, 1935
('67', 55, 5, 7, 92665) BHAI THAKKAR BAPA, I have been prejudiced against S. 2 from the very beginning.
('67', 55, 5, 8, 92745) This work hasnt seemed clean to me.
('67', 55, 5, 9, 92781) It might not perhaps be proper to give anything, against the advice of Shukla and others, from the amount realized through the sale of the cattle.
('67', 55, 5, 10, 92928) If, therefore, you have full faith in him, you may give him something from the money which is lying in my name.
('67', 55, 5, 11, 93040) I sent a wire yesterday regarding Malkani.
('67', 55, 5, 12, 93083) I had to send another today.
('67', 55, 5, 13, 93112) He had gone to Nalvadi to see the work being done there.
('67', 55, 5, 14, 93169) While returning from there, he was bit by something 3 in the darkness.
('67', 55, 5, 15, 93240) He was accompanied by.
('67', 55, 5, 16, 93263) and others.
('67', 55, 5, 17, 93275) They lifted him up and laid him .
('67', 55, 5, 18, 93309) When some conveyance was available he was taken to hospital.
('67', 55, 5, 19, 93370) An incision was made to let out blood.
('67', 55, 5, 20, 93409) The night passed fairly well.
('67', 55, 5, 21, 93439) He will have to remain in the hospital for two days at least.
('67', 55, 5, 22, 93501) Even apart from this, I felt that it is not desirable that neither of you should be present in Delhi.
('67', 55, 5, 23, 93603) Whatever has to be done on the basis of your observations during your visit.
('67', 55, 5, 24, 93680) What may have happened during your absence.
('67', 55, 5, 25, 93724) It is essential that a plan should be drawn up.
('67', 55, 5, 26, 93772) There is, of course .
('67', 55, 5, 27, 93794) about one well.
('67', 55, 5, 28, 93810) There must be many more like that.
('67', 55, 5, 29, 93845) Therefore, think over my suggestion.
('67', 55, 5, 30, 93882) I told Malkani the same thing yesterday and then wired to you.
('67', 55, 5, 31, 93945) If, however, you see any error in this reasoning, ask me.

('67', 56, 8, 16, 95301) I think the present bitterness is purely the result of temperamental differences.
('67', 56, 8, 17, 95383) I see no good coming out of your leaving the Sangh, nor from Jivanlals leaving it.
('67', 56, 8, 18, 95466) It should be a matter of shame for us that well to do and poor workers cannot work together.
('67', 56, 8, 19, 95559) Bhai Jivanlal and you should bear up with each other.
('67', 56, 8, 20, 95613) I dont think that you wish to do anything without consulting Bhai Jivanlal, nor do I find that the latter objects to discussing things with you.
('67', 56, 8, 21, 95758) Today, therefore, I will content myself with this request that both of you should resolve henceforth to work in harmony like blood brothers.
('67', 56, 8, 22, 95899) I have given the same advice to Bhai Jivanlal.
('67', 56, 8, 23, 95946) I have also shown him this letter.

('67', 63, 5, 9, 105008) I have made no categorical statement that the committee is absolved of responsibility.
('67', 63, 5, 10, 105095) What I said was that, if Haribabu and Kotwal have told you that the total of one lakh is also inclusive of the amount meant for Indore University, your responsibility is over.

('67', 67, 3, 4, 109248) AVADHESH,
('67', 67, 4, 5, 109258) May our nation become and remain the greatest in respect of all moral values.
('67', 67, 4, 6, 109336) Mans self respect lies in uplifting himself and in doing this not fearing even death.
('67', 67, 4, 7, 109422) Why is anger necessary for protecting our self respect and fighting wickedness?
('67', 67, 4, 8, 109502) If I am told to rub my nose on the ground I may not be angry and yet refuse to comply and bear cheerfully whatever punishment is vouchsafed for my disobedience.
('67', 67, 4, 9, 109663) Dharma is that which uplifts the soul.
('67', 67, 4, 10, 109702) We shall think that God is a name for Truth, God is identical with truth.

('67', 69, 7, 13, 111971) [May 16, 1935 ] 4
('67', 69, 8, 14, 111989) Ceresole proceeded to tell Gandhiji of some of the books he had recently read.
('67', 69, 8, 15, 112068) There was India in the Dark Wood .
('67', 69, 8, 16, 112103) wanting the main framework of the dominant Hindu philosophy to be shattered.
('67', 69, 8, 17, 112180) Pierre Ceresole said he had turned from this book with relief to Frank Lonwoods book Jesus Lord or Leader where the author rejects the claim of Christianity as the final religion and pines for a fuller and richer faith than we have yet reached and to believe that God, who has nowhere left Himself without witness,will use the highest institutions of other systems and of many races to enrich the thinking and worship of mankind. He sees definite gain in the abandonment of a special claim for the inspiration of the Bible, and classes himself among those who humbly desire to follow Jesus as leader, though their view of truth will not allow them to worship him as Lord.
('67', 69, 8, 18, 112852) Gandhiji said: There is a swing in the pendulum, and I have a Christian friend telling me that the Gita shows him how to live the New Testament, and that many passages in the latter which used to be dark were intelligible to him through a study of the Gita.

('67', 70, 1, 2, 113451) And yet Ceresole feels that each one must find his solace from his own faith.
('67', 70, 1, 3, 113529) He attended our prayer meetings regularly, morning and evening, but said one evening: This repetition of one and the same thing over and over again jars on me.
('67', 70, 1, 4, 113689) It may be the defect of my rationalist, mathematical temperament.
('67', 70, 1, 5, 113755) But somehow I cannot like the repetition..
('67', 70, 2, 6, 113798) GANDHIJI: But even in mathematics you have your recurring decimals.
('67', 70, 3, 7, 113866) PIERRE CERESOLE: But each recurs with a definite new fact.
('67', 70, 4, 8, 113925) G. Even so each repetition, or japa as it is called, has a new meaning, each repetition carries you nearer and nearer to God.
('67', 70, 4, 9, 114051) This is a concrete fact, and I may tell you that you are here talking to no theorist but to one who has experienced what he says every minute of his life, so much so that it is easier for the life to stop than for this incessant process to stop.
('67', 70, 4, 10, 114297) It is a definite need of the soul.
('67', 70, 5, 11, 114332) P.C. I quite see it, but for the average man it becomes an empty formula.
('67', 70, 6, 12, 114406) G. I agree, but the best thing is liable to be abused.
('67', 70, 6, 13, 114461) There is room for any amount of hypocrisy, but even hypocrisy is an ode to virtue.
('67', 70, 6, 14, 114544) And I know that for ten thousand hypocrites you would find millions of simple souls who find their solace from it.
('67', 70, 6, 15, 114659) It is like scaffolding quite essential to a building.
('67', 70, 7, 16, 114713) P.C. But if I may carry the simile a little further, you agree that the scaffolding has to be removed when the building is complete?
('67', 70, 8, 17, 114846) G. Yes, it would be removed when this body is removed.
('67', 70, 9, 18, 114901) P. C. Why?
('67', 70, 10, 19, 114912) JOE WILKINSON: Because we are eternally building.
('67', 70, 11, 20, 114962) G. Because we are eternally striving after perfection.
('67', 70, 11, 21, 115017) God alone is perfect, man is never perfect.

('67', 72, 4, 6, 116704) The following appeal has been issued by Prof.
('67', 72, 4, 7, 116750) Malkani, Joint Secretary, Harijan Sevak Sangh, to the municipalities.
('67', 72, 5, 8, 116820) It is to be hoped that it will receive an effective response from the municipalities.

('67', 72, 7, 10, 116925) 119. HARIJAN EDUCATION
('67', 72, 8, 11, 116948) The question of primary education is in many respects much more difficult than secondary and college education.
('67', 72, 8, 12, 117060) And Harijan education is the most difficult for all.
('67', 72, 8, 13, 117113) Be it in the crudest manner possible, a non Harijan child receives some home culture.
('67', 72, 8, 14, 117199) A Harijan child, being shunned by society, has none.
('67', 72, 8, 15, 117252) Even when, therefore, all primary schools are open to Harijan children, as they must be sooner or later and in my opinion sooner rather than later, preliminary schools will be needed for Harijan children if they are not to labour under a perpetual handicap.
('67', 72, 8, 16, 117510) The preliminary training can be discovered and tried in all the numerous Harijan schools conducted under the aegis of Harijan Sevak Sanghs scattered throughout India.
('67', 72, 8, 17, 117677) That preliminary training should consist in teaching Harijan children manners, good speech and good conduct.
('67', 72, 8, 18, 117786) A Harijan child sits anyhow; dresses anyhow; his eyes, ears, teeth, hair, nails, nose are often full of dirt; many never know what it is to have a wash.
('67', 72, 8, 19, 117939) I remember what I did when in 1915 I picked up a Harijan boy at Tranquebar and took him with me to Kochrab where the Ashram was then situated.
('67', 72, 8, 20, 118082) I had him shaved.
('67', 72, 8, 21, 118100) He was then thoroughly washed and given a simple dhoti, vest and a cap.
('67', 72, 8, 22, 118172) In a few minutes in appearance he became indistinguishable from any child from a cultured home.
('67', 72, 8, 23, 118268) His head, eyes, ears, nose were thoroughly cleaned.
('67', 72, 8, 24, 118320) His nails which had become
('67', 72, 9, 25, 118347) 1 The appeal is not reproduced here; it exhorted the municipalities to provide social amenities, such as housing facilities, better service conditions, provision for sick, casual and maternity leave, etc., to its sweepers and scavengers.
('67', 73, 0, 1, 118585) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 74
('67', 73, 1, 2, 118626) repositories of dirt were pared and cleaned.
('67', 73, 1, 3, 118671) His feet which were laden with dust were rubbed and cleaned out.
('67', 73, 1, 4, 118736) Such a process has to be gone through every day, if need be, with Harijan children attending schools.
('67', 73, 1, 5, 118838) Their lesson should begin for the first three months with teaching them cleanliness.
('67', 73, 1, 6, 118923) They should be taught also how to eat properly, though as I write this sentence I recall what I had seen during the walking pilgrimage 1 in Orissa.
('67', 73, 1, 7, 119071) Harijan boys and grown ups, who were fed at some of the stages, ate with much better cleanliness than the others who soiled their fingers, scattered about the savings and left their plates in a messy condition.
('67', 73, 1, 8, 119282) Harijans had no savings and their dishes were left thoroughly clean.
('67', 73, 1, 9, 119351) Their fingers, whilst they were eating, were after every morsel taken licked clean.
('67', 73, 1, 10, 119435) I know that all Harijan children do not eat so cleanly as the particular ones I have described.
('67', 73, 1, 11, 119531) If this preliminary training is to be given in all Harijan schools, pamphlets giving detailed instructions for teachers in their languages should be prepared and distributed and inspectors of schools be required during their inspection to examine teachers and pupils on this head and to send full reports of the progress made in this direction.
('67', 73, 1, 12, 119876) This programme involves care in the selection of teachers and the training of the present staff.
('67', 73, 1, 13, 119973) But all this is well worth the attention, if the Sangh is to discharge its trust by the thousands of Harijan children that are brought under its care.

('67', 74, 6, 9, 121003) Then, owing to circumstances over which he had no control, he took two days to return.
('67', 74, 6, 10, 121090) The result was that I could not write to you.

('67', 74, 6, 13, 121231) But what will it avail to grieve?
('67', 74, 6, 14, 121265) Co workers come and go.
('67', 74, 6, 15, 121289) You feel that they only go, dont come.
('67', 74, 6, 16, 121328) Even if that be so, what does it matter?
('67', 74, 6, 17, 121369) God doesnt disappear.

('67', 74, 6, 19, 121425) Without Him, of what help could all others be to us?
('67', 74, 6, 20, 121478) They would be so many bodies without souls.
('67', 74, 6, 21, 121522) You should not, therefore, grieve over the passing of a co worker.
('67', 74, 6, 22, 121589) Our duty is to do the best that we can.
('67', 74, 6, 23, 121629) I wont be free before the 21st.
('67', 74, 6, 24, 121661) I shall arrive in Bombay on the 22nd morning.
('67', 74, 6, 25, 121707) The 20th is Monday.
('67', 74, 6, 26, 121727) I must be here on the 21st.
('67', 74, 6, 27, 121755) Most probably I shall be accompanied only by Ba.
('67', 74, 6, 28, 121804) I will take along Mirabehn only if I cannot help it.
('67', 74, 6, 29, 121857) If she insists on coming I shall be obliged to take her and may also bring one more person.
('67', 74, 6, 30, 121949) For food, I will have goats milk, neem leaves and any fruit available locally.
('67', 74, 6, 31, 122028) Please dont get anything from Bombay.
('67', 74, 6, 32, 122066) That is my diet here too.
('67', 74, 6, 33, 122092) In place of lime juice I take the juice of tamarind and in place of green vegetables crushed neem leaves.
('67', 74, 6, 34, 122198) These days I also eat mangoes which grow in the orchard here.
('67', 74, 6, 35, 122260) I have not as yet tasted Bombay mangoes this year.
('67', 74, 6, 36, 122311) I will do that in Bombay.
('67', 74, 6, 37, 122337) But positively not in Borsad.
('67', 74, 6, 38, 122367) I must leave Mahadev behind here.
('67', 74, 6, 39, 122401) I will send him, if necessary, after I return here.
('67', 74, 6, 40, 122453) The rest when we meet.

('67', 75, 3, 4, 122704) BALVANTSINHA,
('67', 75, 4, 5, 122718) I have not a shadow of doubt that it is best for you to settle down in some village.
('67', 75, 4, 6, 122803) You should live by your body labour and serve the villagers by thought, word and deed and to that end observe the eleven vows.
('67', 75, 4, 7, 122930) A timepiece is not a necessity; but if you think it is, you can construct a device using sand or water.
('67', 75, 4, 8, 123034) That would involve no expense whatsoever.
('67', 75, 4, 9, 123076) Yes, you have my permission to visit me whenever you like, only remember that we have no money to waste on railway journeys.

('67', 75, 10, 17, 123384) Are you also growing mentally and emotionally?
('67', 75, 10, 18, 123431) May you be of sound health.
('67', 75, 10, 19, 123459) May your spirit of service grow.

('67', 76, 13, 24, 124620) After I got it, a number of similar incidents have occurred at other places too.

('67', 77, 1, 3, 124929) My writings may have had some effect, but nothing worth speaking about.
('67', 77, 1, 4, 125001) In regard to these activities the local worker at each place must go on doing the best he can.
('67', 77, 1, 5, 125096) He must of course keep me informed.
('67', 77, 1, 6, 125132) We should realize our limitations.
('67', 77, 1, 7, 125167) We are reformers and not policemen.
('67', 77, 1, 8, 125203) Nor do we want to become policemen.
('67', 77, 1, 9, 125239) A reformer brings about reforms by laying down his life for them, the policemen impose them by force.
('67', 77, 1, 10, 125341) The same person cannot function both as a reformer and as policeman.
('67', 77, 1, 11, 125410) Hence the rise of the State.
('67', 77, 1, 12, 125439) Since, however, we are not with the State we can get but negligible help from it.
('67', 77, 1, 13, 125521) We may accept it wherever we can do so without loss of self respect.

('67', 77, 5, 19, 125781) An argument was advanced and I reacted to it.
('67', 77, 5, 20, 125827) There was no intention to cast any aspersion on anyone.
('67', 77, 5, 21, 125883) I had already made it clear that the consultation I had was only informal.
('67', 77, 5, 22, 125958) I had later on understood that it would not be proper to exclude the publishers from the office of the secretary.
('67', 77, 5, 23, 126072) There is no reason for you to sever connection.
('67', 77, 5, 24, 126120) I hope that you will give up the intention of resigning.

('67', 78, 6, 28, 128213) They seem to me to have immense possibilities.

('67', 81, 1, 11, 131818) There are often enough cases of poisoning among people insured.
('67', 81, 1, 12, 131882) I do not see anything special about joint insurance.
('67', 81, 1, 13, 131935) Where do you have the boils?
('67', 81, 1, 14, 131964) Mud treatemnt may be given up if it does not bring prompt relief.
('67', 81, 2, 15, 132030) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Nothing should be done rashly.

('67', 81, 6, 19, 132192) SUMANGAL,
('67', 81, 7, 20, 132202) I have your letter.
('67', 81, 7, 21, 132222) I know what value to place on the sentiments it contains.
('67', 81, 7, 22, 132280) I know how permanent they are.
('67', 81, 7, 23, 132311) Remain quiet for a couple of months.
('67', 81, 7, 24, 132348) Improve your health.
('67', 81, 7, 25, 132369) Eat sparingly.
('67', 81, 7, 26, 132384) Find pleasure in what is good.
('67', 81, 7, 27, 132415) If what pleases is not good, give it up.
('67', 81, 7, 28, 132456) Do not worry about the future.
('67', 81, 7, 29, 132487) Take good care of the present.
('67', 81, 7, 30, 132518) This covers everything.
('67', 81, 7, 31, 132542) I shall be at Borsad from the 23rd to the 31st.
('67', 81, 7, 32, 132590) Then Wardha.

('67', 82, 2, 3, 132869) [On or before May 21, 1935 ] 2
('67', 82, 3, 4, 132900) GANDHIJI: Why, service which has not the slightest touch of self in it is itself the highest religion.
('67', 82, 3, 5, 133003) [STUDENT:] But one must be devoted to someone?
('67', 82, 3, 6, 133050) Yes, to Truth.
('67', 82, 3, 7, 133065) I am devoted to none but Truth and I owe no discipline to anybody but Truth.
('67', 82, 4, 8, 133142) But how is one to get inspiration from this general idea?
('67', 82, 4, 9, 133200) That means to say that you want a God who has form.
('67', 82, 4, 10, 133252) Truth is too impersonal for you.
('67', 82, 4, 11, 133285) Well, idolatry is embedded in human nature.
('67', 82, 4, 12, 133329) But you may if you like worship God as Truth, if not Truth as God.
('67', 82, 4, 13, 133396) God is Truth, but God is many other things also.
('67', 82, 4, 14, 133445) That is why I prefer to say Truth is God.
('67', 82, 4, 15, 133487) But you need not go into what may sound like mystic lore; you may simply worship what you find to be the Truth, for Truth is known relatively.
('67', 82, 4, 16, 133630) Only remember that Truth is not one of the many qualities that we name.
('67', 82, 4, 17, 133702) It is the living embodiment of God, it is the only Life, and I identify Truth with fullest life, and that is how it becomes a concrete thing, for God is His whole Creation, the whole Existence, and service of all that exists.
('67', 82, 4, 18, 133928) Truth is service of God.
('67', 82, 5, 19, 133953) But how should we Christian students go to the villagers?
('67', 82, 5, 20, 134011) They might shun us because we are Christians.
('67', 82, 5, 21, 134057) You will tell them: We are Christians, but dont be alarmed, even as we are not alarmed because you are Hindus.
('67', 82, 5, 22, 134168) We have no designs on you, as we know that you have no designs on us.
('67', 82, 5, 23, 134238) We want you to be better Hindus, even as by reasons of our contact with you we know that we will better Chrisitains. That is the way of approach.
('67', 82, 5, 24, 134384) It is idle to talk of winning souls for God.
('67', 82, 5, 25, 134429) Is God so helpless that He cannot win souls for Himself?
('67', 82, 5, 26, 134486) Everyones religion is a personal matter with himself.
('67', 82, 5, 27, 134540) I cannot preach Hinduism, I can but practise it.

('67', 83, 2, 3, 135006) [On or before] May [21, ] 1 1935 This is Jawaharlal Nehru all over.
('67', 83, 2, 4, 135074) He means nothing.
('67', 83, 2, 5, 135092) He did not invite [a] discussion on my view of statue of Westminster.
('67', 83, 2, 6, 135162) But his moods we know and must learn to tolerate cheerfully.
('67', 83, 2, 7, 135223) I have written to Anand.
('67', 83, 2, 8, 135248) He is the author of his own grief.
('67', 83, 2, 9, 135283) The best way to bring his father round is to forget him.
('67', 83, 2, 10, 135340) It is also the best way to soothe and serve him.
('67', 83, 2, 11, 135389) He must also firmly tell his mother that she must not grieve over the separation.
('67', 83, 2, 12, 135471) She may not listen to him but if after having given her that advice, she does persist in nursing her grief, Anand should not worry.
('67', 83, 2, 13, 135603) As to Vidya, I do not believe in prolonging the existence of the body at any cost or without purpose.
('67', 83, 2, 14, 135705) A lingering death is worse than a quick death brought about by disregarding or refusing the highly artifical aids that the so called science has provided.
('67', 83, 2, 15, 135860) I have written in that strain to Anand.
('67', 83, 2, 16, 135900) Perhaps you too will be shocked over this last view on preservation of the body.
('67', 83, 2, 17, 135981) But is the view I have held and enforced for years.
('67', 83, 2, 18, 136033) I enforced it in Miras and Nanavatis cases when both bodies were said to be perishing.

('67', 83, 6, 24, 136318) Wait and see what happens now.
('67', 83, 6, 25, 136349) The fruits of patience are sweet.
('67', 83, 6, 26, 136383) I had heard long ago that you did not get the permission.
('67', 83, 6, 27, 136441) I had even forgotten about the matter.
('67', 83, 6, 28, 136480) May it not be that God will throw me to that side one day so that we might meet?

('67', 84, 8, 10, 137147) [May 21, 1935 ]
('67', 84, 9, 11, 137163) PIERRE CERESOLE: Could one lay down a rule of life for the wealthy?
('67', 84, 9, 12, 137231) 2 That is to say, could one define how much belongs to the rich and how much does not belong to them?
('67', 84, 10, 13, 137333) GANDHIJI: Yes.
('67', 84, 10, 14, 137348) Let the rich man take 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, or 15 per cent.
('67', 84, 11, 15, 137414) But not 85 per cent?
('67', 84, 11, 16, 137435) I was thinking of going up to 25 per cent!
('67', 84, 11, 17, 137478) but not even an exploiter must think of taking 85 per cent!
('67', 84, 11, 18, 137538) That is where I disagree with the communist.
('67', 84, 11, 19, 137583) 3 With me the ultimatetest is non violence.
('67', 84, 11, 20, 137627) We have always to remember that even we were one day in the same position as the wealthy man.
('67', 84, 11, 21, 137721) It has not been an easy process with us and as we bore with ourselves, even so should we bear with others.
('67', 84, 11, 22, 137828) Besides, I have no right to assume that I am right and he is wrong.
('67', 84, 11, 23, 137896) I have to wait until I convert him to my point of view.
('67', 84, 11, 24, 137952) In the meanwhile if he says, I am prepared to keep for myself 25 per cent and to give 75 percent to charities, I close with the offer.
('67', 84, 11, 25, 138087) For I know that 75 per cent voluntarily given is better than 100 per cent surrendered at the point of the bayonet, and by thus being
('67', 84, 12, 26, 138220) 1 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter; Desai had explained that the discussion took place in the train on way to Bombay.
('67', 84, 12, 27, 138357) Ceresole was to return to Europe on May 23. 2 Mahadev Desai had explained that Pierre was reading a book in which the communist author had suggested that Gandhijis sympathy for the poor was only a cover for his real sympathy for the rich. 3 Mahadev Desai had explained: Ceresoles tangible difficulty was how long one should wait in order to carry conviction to the rich man.

('67', 85, 1, 2, 138773) satisfied with 75 per cent I render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars.
('67', 85, 1, 3, 138850) Non violence must be the common factor between us.
('67', 85, 1, 4, 138901) You may argue that a man who surrenders by compulsion today will voluntarily accept the position tomorrow.
('67', 85, 1, 5, 139008) That, to my mind, is a remote possiblility on which I should not care to build much.
('67', 85, 1, 6, 139093) What is certain is that if I use violence today, I shall be doubtless faced with greater violence.
('67', 85, 1, 7, 139192) With non violence as the rule, life will no doubt be a series of compromises.
('67', 85, 1, 8, 139270) But it is better than an endless series of clashes.
('67', 85, 2, 9, 139322) How would you in a word describe the rich mans legitimate position?
('67', 85, 2, 10, 139390) That of a trustee.
('67', 85, 2, 11, 139409) I know a number of friends who earn and spend for the poor and who do not regard themselves as anything but trustees of their wealth.
('67', 85, 3, 12, 139543) I too have a number of friends wealthy and poor.
('67', 85, 3, 13, 139592) I do not possess wealth but accept money from my wealthy friends.
('67', 85, 3, 14, 139658) How can I justify myself.
('67', 85, 3, 15, 139684) You will accept nothing for yourself personally.
('67', 85, 3, 16, 139733) That is to say, you will not accept a cheque to go to Switzerland for a change but you will accept a lakh of rupees for wells for Harijans or for schools and hospitals for them.
('67', 85, 3, 17, 139911) All self has got to be eliminated and the problem is simplified.
('67', 85, 4, 18, 139976) But what about my personal expense?
('67', 85, 4, 19, 140012) You have to act on the principle that a labourer is worthy of his hire.
('67', 85, 4, 20, 140084) You must not hesitate to accept your minimum wage.
('67', 85, 4, 21, 140135) Every one of us is doing the same thing.
('67', 85, 4, 22, 140176) Bhansalis wage is just wheat flour and neem leaves.
('67', 85, 4, 23, 140228) We cannot all be Bhansalis, but we can try to approximate to that life.
('67', 85, 4, 24, 140300) Thus I will be satisfied with having my livelihood, but I must not ask a rich man to accommodate my son.
('67', 85, 4, 25, 140405) My only concern is to keep my body and soul together so long as I serve the community.
('67', 85, 5, 26, 140492) But so long as I draw that allowance from him, is it not my duty to remind him continually of the unenviableness of his position and to tell him that he must cease to be owner of all that he does not need for his bare living?
('67', 85, 5, 27, 140718) Oh yes, that is your duty.
('67', 85, 6, 28, 140745) But there are wealthy and wealthy.
('67', 85, 6, 29, 140780) There are some who may have made their pile from alcoholic traffic.
('67', 85, 6, 30, 140848) Yes, you will certainly draw a line.
('67', 85, 6, 31, 140885) But whilst you will not accept money from a brewer, I do not know what will happen if you have made an appeal for funds.
('67', 85, 6, 32, 141006) Will you tell the people that only those who have justly earned their money will pay?
('67', 85, 6, 33, 141092) I would rather withdraw the appeal than expect any money on those terms.
('67', 85, 6, 34, 141165) Who is to decide whether one is just or otherwise?
('67', 85, 6, 35, 141216) And justice too is a relative term.
('67', 85, 6, 36, 141252) If we will but ask ourselves, we will find that we have not been just all our

('67', 86, 1, 2, 141376) the Gita says in effect that everyone is tarred with the same brush; so rather than judge others, live in the world untouched or unaffected by it.
('67', 86, 1, 3, 141523) Elimination of self is the secret.

('67', 86, 3, 6, 141615) [May 22, 1935 ] 1
('67', 86, 4, 7, 141633) GANDHIJI: That is quite right.
('67', 86, 4, 8, 141664) 2 Now, have you got your questions ready?
('67', 86, 4, 9, 141706) What is it you want me to tell?
('67', 86, 5, 10, 141738) REPRESENTATIVE: First and foremost I would like you to tell me something about the All India Village Industries Association.
('67', 86, 5, 11, 141863) What work has it been doing since it was started ten months ago?
('67', 86, 5, 12, 141928) G. The work of the Village Industries Association is going on steadily.
('67', 86, 5, 13, 142000) There is nothing heroic to report.
('67', 86, 5, 14, 142035) But not a moment is being wasted in the pursuit of the programme chalked out at the commencement.
('67', 86, 5, 15, 142133) Though we are having all the difficulties that were anticipated and others which were not anticipated, I still swear by the original programme.
('67', 86, 5, 16, 142277) I believe that on this earth there is no better instrument of progress than human flesh, and you cannot expect brilliant results if that flesh is weak, and is daily getting weaker, because of interior and exterior defects.
('67', 86, 5, 17, 142500) We are, therefore, tackling the question of food and that of sanitation.
('67', 86, 5, 18, 142573) And since charity begins at home, we are trying to reproduce at the centre conditions that we would like to see in use in every village of India.
('67', 86, 5, 19, 142719) Side by side with that we have selected a village nearest the centre for experiment.
('67', 86, 5, 20, 142804) I would like the Press to realize the deep significance of the movement and give its intelligent support.
('67', 86, 5, 21, 142910) By intelligent support I mean that important newspapers should have on their staff specialists who would regularly contribute instructive articles which the reader can profit by.
('67', 86, 5, 22, 143089) You will see that in the programme which to the superficial observer appears dry, but in reality is highly interesting, there is no room for difference of opinion.
('67', 86, 5, 23, 143253) all parties and persons must recognize the primary necessity of Indias millions getting nourishing food or a balanced diet, as Dr. Tilak calls it, and healthy surroundings.
('67', 86, 5, 24, 143426) I think that both these things are possible in spite of our corroding poverty.
('67', 86, 6, 25, 143505) 1 According to the reporter, the interview took place in Calcutta Mail, which was nearing Bombay early in the morning.
('67', 86, 6, 26, 143624) 2 The source had reported: Before the interview commenced, the representa tive told Gandhiji that he had been instructed not to put him any questions about politics.
('67', 87, 0, 1, 143790) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 88
('67', 87, 1, 2, 143831) When informed that though it had been ten months since the Association was started little was known about the work done on behalf of the Association excepting, possibly, about the work at Wardha and Panvel, Gandhiji said that silent work was being done all over the country.
('67', 87, 1, 3, 144106) The workers were finding out the depths to which the work could be carried on.
('67', 87, 1, 4, 144185) There was nothing much to report in the papers, day to day or week to week.
('67', 87, 1, 5, 144261) As workers of the right stamp were being found, the different questions were being tackled.
('67', 87, 2, 6, 144353) Asked whether it would not be necessary for him to undertake an all India tour in the near future, with a view to widen the scope and work of the Association, Gandhiji said that he did not think that it was necessary just yet.
('67', 87, 2, 7, 144580) He added: Undertaking an all India tour just now would be for tackling the extent instead of the depth.
('67', 87, 2, 8, 144684) There was no doubt that such a tour would bring money, and I will be giving superficial instructions about the work, that too without knowing anything of the difficulties that face village workers.
('67', 87, 2, 9, 144882) Just now I am endeavouring to concentrate at the centre and the neighbouring village to give myself and co workers first hand instructions.
('67', 87, 2, 10, 145022) Other workers in other centres are also carrying on work likewise.
('67', 87, 2, 11, 145089) When we have taken the preliminary training then I will go on an all India tour, if necessary.
('67', 87, 2, 12, 145184) Remember this is a question of a kind of adult education on a mass scale.
('67', 87, 2, 13, 145258) It cannot be given without previous preparation.
('67', 87, 2, 14, 145307) I have said all that I have to say about the All India Village Industries Association.
('67', 87, 2, 15, 145394) That is all.
('67', 87, 3, 16, 145407) Our representative told Gandhiji that he would ask him one or two brief questions and not disturb him after that.
('67', 87, 3, 17, 145521) Gandhiji was reminded about Dr. Tagores message to him regarding village arts and the A.I.V.I.A. in which the Poet had said that the Central Museum that is to be started by the Association should not be restricted only to industries.
('67', 87, 3, 18, 145755) The Poet had said: .
('67', 87, 3, 19, 145776) the economic life of a nation is not such an isolated fact as Mahatmaji imagines, and today, side by side with economic poverty we are faced with cultural poverty which puts us to shameshame that is in no way lessened when we consider what we once were.
('67', 87, 3, 20, 146030) Our art treasures are today found in museums outside India, and our village artists are dying out .
('67', 87, 3, 21, 146130) Please tell Mahatmaji that art is not a luxury of the well to do.
('67', 87, 3, 22, 146196) The poor man needs it as much and employs it as much in his cottage building, his pots, his floor decorations, etc.
('67', 87, 3, 23, 146312) If Mahatmajis men go round collecting specimens of village industries, why can they not look for and collect specimens of various indigenous arts spread all over our land and waiting to be re cherished.
('67', 87, 3, 24, 146515) . Gandhiji said: Every message coming from Dr. Tagore must receive respectful attention from me.
('67', 87, 3, 25, 146612) I quite believe that we have got to take care of village arts and by his assistance we shall not neglect the arts.
('67', 87, 3, 26, 146727) He would not let us neglect, even if we forgot our duties.
('67', 87, 3, 27, 146786) He had lent the assistance of Sjt.
('67', 87, 3, 28, 146821) Surendranath Kar who has already paid a preliminary visit and I have discussed the whole thing with

('67', 88, 1, 2, 146967) Deenabandhu C.F. Andrews who will in turn discuss with Gurudev.
('67', 88, 2, 3, 147031) Gandhiji was asked if he wanted Hindustani, the Lingua Franca of India, to be written both in Devanagari and Urdu scripts.
('67', 88, 2, 4, 147154) Gandhiji replied: Hindustani will naturally be written by the vast masses in Devanagari, but Mussalmans will for a long time to comeor, it may be for all timeinsist on writing in Urdu script.
('67', 88, 2, 5, 147346) Therefore, in the definition we have said that Hindustani is the language spoken by the people in the North and written either in Devanagari or Urdu script.
('67', 88, 2, 6, 147503) My hope, however, is that when religious differences have sunk and religious unity is accentuated, and friendship of the heart established between Hindus and Mussalmans, Devanagari, as the most scientific script of all the scripts of the world, will receive its due, that is, universal recognition in India.
('67', 88, 3, 7, 147811) At this stage, Sjt.
('67', 88, 3, 8, 147831) Mahadev Desai informed our representative that his time was up, and he should leave the seat he was occupying and Gandhiji observed that he would not have enough time to talk to his son if further questions were asked.
('67', 88, 3, 9, 148050) The Chronicle representative said that he would leave his seat immediately after he had got a reply for his last and only question that he would put, adding: I know it is beyond the scope of my instructions to ask this question as it is definitely political. Gandhiji said: Go ahead.
('67', 88, 3, 10, 148334) [R.] It was stated by Sjt.
('67', 88, 3, 11, 148361) Bhulabhai Desai the other day that everyone should try to get back Gandhiji into the congress and the politics.
('67', 88, 3, 12, 148473) When are you coming back to the Congress?
('67', 88, 3, 13, 148515) Gandhiji laughed and said: If you have direct access to God, ask him when I am coming back to the Congress.
('67', 88, 3, 14, 148623) I am saying this because I do not know it myself.

('67', 88, 5, 16, 148705) 1 Here the source had reported: By the time Gandhiji gave the above reply, the train had reached Kalyan and Ramdas Gandhi and others got into the compar tment.
('67', 88, 5, 17, 148865) . 2 The reporter had concluded: After the above question, our representative was asked to take his leave but before leaving his seat Gandhiji asked him to collect his commission from the torchers, meaning the photographers!
('67', 88, 5, 18, 149089) A certain amount (less than a rupee) was collected and handed over to Gandhiji.

('67', 89, 2, 3, 149242) BOMBAY, May 22, 1935 You will wonder why I consented to have a prayer meeting in Bombay, when even the existence of God is with many a matter of doubt.
('67', 89, 2, 4, 149394) There are others who say: If God is seated in the heart of everyone, who shall pray to whom, who shall invoke whom? I am not here to solve these intellectual puzzles.
('67', 89, 2, 5, 149561) I can only say that ever since my childhood prayer has been my solace and my strength.
('67', 89, 2, 6, 149648) I am told that there is despair and depression everywhere, that there is disappointment all round as the gateway to jail is closed.
('67', 89, 2, 7, 149780) People, I am told, do not know what to do.
('67', 89, 2, 8, 149823) I do not know why, when there is the whole of the constructive programme of work to do.
('67', 89, 2, 9, 149911) When the programme of jail going was on, there was room for hypocrisy, compulsion, violence.
('67', 89, 2, 10, 150004) he present constructive programme leaves no room for these.
('67', 89, 2, 11, 150064) And it leaves no room for disappointment and despair.
('67', 89, 2, 12, 150118) For them there is the name of God.
('67', 89, 2, 13, 150153) It is Gods covenant that whoever goes to Him in weakness and helplessness, him He will make strong.
('67', 89, 2, 14, 150253) When I am weak, then I am strong. As the poet Surdas has sung, Rama is the strength of the weak.
('67', 89, 2, 15, 150350) This strength is not to be obtained by taking up arms or by similar means.
('67', 89, 2, 16, 150425) It is to be had by throwing oneself on His name.
('67', 89, 2, 17, 150474) Rama is but a synonym of God.
('67', 89, 2, 18, 150504) You may say God or Allah or whatever other name you like, but the moment you trust naught but Him, you are strong, all disappointment disappears.
('67', 89, 2, 19, 150650) The hymn alludes to the story of the Lord of elephants who was in the jaws of a crocodile and who had been all but drowned in water.
('67', 89, 2, 20, 150783) There was only the tip of his trunk left above water when he invoked Gods name and he was saved.
('67', 89, 2, 21, 150880) No doubt it is an allegory.
('67', 89, 2, 22, 150908) But it conceals a truth.
('67', 89, 2, 23, 150933) Over and over again in my life I have found it.
('67', 89, 2, 24, 150981) Even in darkest despair, when there seems no helper and no comfort in the wide wide world, His name inspires us with strength and puts all doubts and despair to flight.
('67', 89, 2, 25, 151150) The sky may be overcast today with clouds, but a fervent prayer to Him is enough to dispel them.
('67', 89, 2, 26, 151247) It is because of prayer that I have known no disappointment.
('67', 89, 2, 27, 151308) Though I have retired from the Congress, I have not closed my eyes or stopped my ears.
('67', 89, 2, 28, 151395) I know all that is happening about me, and if anyone must give way to despair, it should be I. But I have known no despair.
('67', 89, 3, 29, 151519) 1 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 89, 3, 30, 151574) The meeting was held in the Congress House compound.
('67', 89, 3, 31, 151627) Thousands of men and women were found seated on house tops, balconies and terraces.

('67', 90, 1, 2, 151757) then should you give way to it?
('67', 90, 1, 3, 151789) Let us pray that He may cleanse our hearts of pettinesses, meannesses and deceit, and He will surely answer our prayers.
('67', 90, 1, 4, 151910) Many I know have always turned to that unfailing source of strength.
('67', 90, 1, 5, 151979) Swaraj is our birthright.
('67', 90, 1, 6, 152005) No one can deprive us of it, unless we forfeit it ourselves.
('67', 90, 1, 7, 152066) We have forfeited it and we have to win it back.
('67', 90, 1, 8, 152115) Swaraj does not depend on jail going.
('67', 90, 1, 9, 152153) If it did, there are thousands of prisoners in jail today.
('67', 90, 1, 10, 152212) It depends on everyone doing his or her own task.
('67', 90, 1, 11, 152262) That task has been shown to you.
('67', 90, 1, 12, 152295) Go to the villages, identify yourselves with villagers, befriend the untouchables, make Hindu Muslim unity a concrete fact.
('67', 90, 1, 13, 152419) Do not despair although there may be Hindu Muslim riots in the country, but go ahead with the work before you and be sure that He will pull you through.

('67', 90, 5, 17, 152680) We arrived here [at] 5.45. It is now 8.20 a.m.

('67', 90, 5, 23, 152864) There are many old faces here ready to anticipate my wants.
('67', 90, 5, 24, 152924) So you need have no anxiety on my behalf.
('67', 90, 5, 25, 152966) I am quite clear in my mind that it was well not to take you with me.
('67', 90, 5, 26, 153036) But this is no precedent for the future.
('67', 90, 5, 27, 153077) And in any case yours is to be the final voice.
('67', 90, 5, 28, 153125) I hope you are getting all you need in the shape of fruit.

('67', 91, 2, 3, 153759) May 23, 1935
('67', 91, 3, 4, 153772) NARANDAS,
('67', 91, 4, 5, 153782) I got your letter today.
('67', 91, 4, 6, 153807) I have sent you a wire asking you to send Keshu.
('67', 91, 4, 7, 153856) I do not remember your having asked for my permission.
('67', 91, 4, 8, 153911) I did not at all like Harilals idea about watches.
('67', 91, 4, 9, 153962) 1 Dissuade him.
('67', 91, 4, 10, 153978) If he goes in for it in spite of that, let him.
('67', 91, 4, 11, 154026) Mathew has grown impatient about coming.
('67', 91, 4, 12, 154067) The Ashram does not owe him anything.
('67', 91, 4, 13, 154105) If you feel inclined, we may send him railway fare for coming; I dont.
('67', 91, 4, 14, 154176) If he is very eager to come, he will, I am writing to him and informing him that if he does not come in a few days, time he will not be taken up.
('67', 91, 4, 15, 154322) Titus has not gone on leave.
('67', 91, 4, 16, 154351) He has left altogether.
('67', 91, 4, 17, 154375) He was paid railway fare for the journey.
('67', 91, 4, 18, 154417) I had agreed to keep him at Wardha, but he did not seem very eager.
('67', 91, 4, 19, 154485) However, he will reply from Travancore.
('67', 91, 4, 20, 154525) I have refused to give him a note of recommendation on anybody else.
('67', 91, 4, 21, 154594) For the present draw the amount for Tharparkar from the Ashram account.
('67', 91, 4, 22, 154666) Afterwards, if necessary, I will pay it from some other account.
('67', 91, 4, 23, 154731) In my view Chimanlal 2 is spending too much.
('67', 91, 4, 24, 154776) But since we have tolerated similar expenditure by other, we should tolerate it in his case too.
('67', 91, 4, 25, 154873) To a certain extent the desire to recover and to live on clings in all of us.
('67', 91, 4, 26, 154951) Each one fixes his own limit of expenditure.
('67', 91, 4, 27, 154996) Chimanlal is satisfied merely with staying in Veraval and having Talwalkars 3
('67', 91, 5, 28, 155074) injection.
('67', 91, 5, 29, 155085) But we have spent over others much more than that.
('67', 91, 5, 30, 155136) I therefore, do not feel like imposing excessive restrictions on senior workers.
('67', 91, 5, 31, 155217) We should be satisfied with whatever self restraint he exercises.
('67', 91, 5, 32, 155283) Do you have anything else to suggest in this matter?
('67', 91, 5, 33, 155336) I see that we shall not get interest.
('67', 91, 5, 34, 155374) It seems that giving money to Gajanan was a mistake.
('67', 91, 5, 35, 155427) He had even given up study.
('67', 91, 5, 36, 155455) The payment to Dhiru also should stop.
('67', 91, 5, 37, 155494) He will have a copy of the agreement he gave in writing.
('67', 91, 5, 38, 155551) It may be with Chhaganlal.
('67', 91, 5, 39, 155578) Look into the matter.
('67', 91, 5, 40, 155600) Was my suggestion to Lilavati all right?

('67', 92, 6, 12, 156248) RESPECTED BROTHER,
('67', 92, 7, 13, 156267) Narandas informs me that, though you have read and reflected a great deal, all that seems to be of little help now and your mind has become weak.
('67', 92, 7, 14, 156413) I am not surprised, for this happens to everybody.
('67', 92, 7, 15, 156464) I must say, however, that I have cherishd a different hope about you.
('67', 92, 7, 16, 156534) For one whose mind has turned Godward, there is no old age.
('67', 92, 7, 17, 156594) The body becomes weak but in that it but follows its law.
('67', 92, 7, 18, 156652) The mind need not become weak.
('67', 92, 7, 19, 156683) It may go on rising till at last it merges in God.
('67', 92, 7, 20, 156734) Isn't this the meaning of the verse:
('67', 92, 8, 21, 156771) This is the state, O Partha, of the man who rests in Brahman; having attained to it, he is not deluded.
('67', 92, 8, 22, 156875) He who abides in this state even at the hour of death passes into oneness with Brahman.
('67', 92, 9, 23, 156963) Isnt the true brahmi state that which endures up to the end?
('67', 92, 9, 24, 157024) What should a mind that has become weak do to attain such a state?
('67', 92, 9, 25, 157091) The only reply is, constant repetition of the name.
('67', 92, 9, 26, 157143) I, therefore, pray that you should make a firm resolution and, withdrawing your mind from everything, merely go on repeating, after taking the Lords name, the following verse:
('67', 92, 10, 27, 157319) I desire neither earthly kingdom nor paradise no, not even release from birth and death .
('67', 92, 10, 28, 157409) I desire only release of the afflicted from misery.
('67', 92, 11, 29, 157461) If you cannot do this, repetition of the name will suffice.
('67', 92, 11, 30, 157521) If you fill your mind completely with strength and light, you will cease

('67', 93, 14, 28, 158770) Please understand that I was very eager to take you with me but I had to restrain my desire.
('67', 93, 14, 29, 158863) I have no doubt that it is for the best.
('67', 93, 14, 30, 158904) But there is no doubt, either, that you are wanting to accompany me.
('67', 93, 14, 31, 158973) I hope everything is going on all right.
('67', 93, 14, 32, 159014) Take as much interest in prayers as you can.
('67', 93, 14, 33, 159059) Kanu must learn the chapters of the Gita by heart.

('67', 94, 4, 5, 159322) I was distressed to see you so upset on the 21st.
('67', 94, 4, 6, 159372) But it was well that I learnt the extent of your weakness.
('67', 94, 4, 7, 159431) You should now be calm in mind and understand yourself.

('67', 94, 16, 24, 160047) Your weight must be increasing.

('67', 95, 2, 3, 160284) [On or after May 23, 1935] 2
('67', 95, 3, 4, 160313) Rats and fleas spread the infection and experts say that these have got to be exterminated.
('67', 95, 3, 5, 160405) But rats and fleas are messengers of God.
('67', 95, 3, 6, 160447) God speaks to us through them.
('67', 95, 3, 7, 160478) In villages where Nature has blessed you with the finest climate and the healthiest soil, as I can see with my own eyes, you have so infringed Natures rules that plague seems to have a knack of appearing again and again if you do not make your houses and surroundings inhospitable to them.
('67', 95, 3, 8, 160768) A man like me wedded to non violence would say rats and fleas have as much right to live as I, and there is no reason why I should not exterminate myself rather than that I exterminate them.
('67', 95, 3, 9, 160959) But I cannot reach that pitch of non violence in this lifetime, may be in several lifetimes, nor perhaps can you.
('67', 95, 3, 10, 161073) But you certainly can produce conditions where rats and fleas can never flourish.
('67', 95, 3, 11, 161155) I want you to create those conditions.
('67', 95, 3, 12, 161194) I want you to make the cleaning and scavenging campaign of these volunteers a permanent affair, and I want you to break up your floors, break up rat nests and rat burrows, and construct floors where rats cannot make their homes.
('67', 95, 4, 13, 161423) A plague infected man is worse than a plague infected rat or fleas and unless you make your bodies proofs against infection you cannot abolish these epidemics.
('67', 95, 4, 14, 161583) Nature has endowed us with enough capacity for the resistance of disease.
('67', 95, 4, 15, 161657) It is we who, careless of her laws, have ruined that capacity.
('67', 95, 4, 16, 161720) We have to regain it by healthy and hygienic ways of living and eating.

('67', 95, 6, 18, 161810) 1 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 95, 6, 19, 161865) Without mentioning either the date or the place of the meeting or meetings, Mahadev Desai had merely reported that Gandhiji addressed about ten meetings in these villages and in the course of his speeches asked the people not to go to sleep over the flight of the enemy but to take permanent measures for banishing him. 2 Gandhiji reached Borsad on May 23. 3 What follows was reported by Mahadev Desai as said by Gandhiji in one of his speeches.
('67', 95, 6, 20, 162311) Mahadev Desai had explained: During his eight days stay at Borsad, Gandhiji got Dr. Bhaskar to issue a series of leaflets on the elements of rat proofing of houses and on the disease proofing of human bodies.

('67', 96, 9, 12, 163053) MY DEAR AGATHA,
('67', 96, 10, 13, 163069) Whilst C. F. A. is here I need not write at all.
('67', 96, 10, 14, 163118) But I must refer to your letter enclosing Carl Heaths letter to Manchester Guardian.
('67', 96, 10, 15, 163203) The letter evokes no response because it takes no note of the truth as it is known here.
('67', 96, 10, 16, 163292) The king there is, or may be, above party strife.
('67', 96, 10, 17, 163342) The King Emperor is here identified with the services.
('67', 96, 10, 18, 163397) He is the ruler through his Viceroy.
('67', 96, 10, 19, 163434) The India Office laughs to see the paragraph which is so hopelessly out of touch with the reality.
('67', 96, 10, 20, 163533) And why should the Government release prisoners who bear no affection either towards the Emperor as such or his Empire?
('67', 96, 10, 21, 163653) I have never appreciated the agitation for the release of political prisoners.
('67', 96, 10, 22, 163732) I have understood the Governments stubborn refusal.
('67', 96, 10, 23, 163784) It is consistent.
('67', 96, 10, 24, 163802) It is wrong only if the whole system is admitted to be wrong.

('67', 97, 3, 4, 164015) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('67', 97, 4, 5, 164030) So you were not free from the effect of the accident even at the time you wrote, i.e., the 20th instant.
('67', 97, 4, 6, 164135) I hope you are now completely free.
('67', 97, 4, 7, 164171) I am glad you have established touch with the villagers.
('67', 97, 4, 8, 164228) You should learn their domestic condition and know them as if they were members of the family.
('67', 97, 4, 9, 164323) Their morals need not worry us just now for they know no better.
('67', 97, 4, 10, 164388) They have not a guilty conscience.
('67', 97, 4, 11, 164423) If therefore we establish contact with them it becomes easy and effective to ask them to give up some of their habits.
('67', 97, 4, 12, 164542) Heat is there but none too oppressive.
('67', 97, 4, 13, 164581) I am not writing to Charlie separately.

('67', 97, 9, 21, 164809) There are plenty of winders here and slivers.
('67', 97, 9, 22, 164855) Of foot wipers too there is no dearth.
('67', 97, 9, 23, 164894) So far as food is concerned, Bal goes and gets the goat milked and mangoes are plentiful.
('67', 97, 9, 24, 164984) Neem trees are everywhere.
('67', 97, 9, 25, 165011) So you need have no anxiety on my score.

('67', 100, 7, 10, 167911) The Central Board of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has already built many wells out of the fund that was placed at its disposal by Sheth Jugalkishore Birla.
('67', 100, 7, 11, 168062) That fund is exhausted and there is still a need for buiding wells for Harijans.
('67', 100, 7, 12, 168143) The orthodox opposition to the use by Harijans of common wells still continues in many places, and Harijans are obliged either to drink water out of cattle troughs or pay for water which people may for a consideration pour into their pots.
('67', 100, 7, 13, 168383) Every additional well built is therefore undoubtedly a great comfort to Harijans, but it is also an increase in the wealth of the country.
('67', 100, 7, 14, 168522) The Central Board of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has resolved to make an appeal for one lac of rupees for the purpose.
('67', 100, 7, 15, 168637) Figures are being prepared for presentation to the public showing the wants of the different provinces.
('67', 100, 7, 16, 168741) One lac is nothing in comparison to the need.
('67', 100, 7, 17, 168787) But the Sangh has not the resources to spend large sums on well construction.
('67', 100, 7, 18, 168865) It is slow work requiring special skill.
('67', 100, 7, 19, 168906) Not everyone can construct a well.
('67', 100, 7, 20, 168941) And the work being scattered makes it very difficult to provide effective supervision.
('67', 100, 7, 21, 169028) The policy of the Board is not to ask for what it cannot spend well and give a good account of to the public.
('67', 100, 7, 22, 169138) I hope the modest appeal will receive prompt and adequate response.

('67', 101, 4, 6, 169489) My own general advice to all has been to stop all college education as soon as they have had in their own opinion enough of it and enter business.
('67', 101, 4, 7, 169636) Those who have love of education truly begin it after the college course.

('67', 102, 4, 5, 170590) Why did father undertake a fast?
('67', 102, 4, 6, 170623) What did he do during the fast?
('67', 102, 4, 7, 170655) Did he suffer much?
('67', 102, 4, 8, 170675) What does he eat now?
('67', 102, 4, 9, 170697) How was the fast concluded?

('67', 102, 10, 19, 171069) BHAGWANJI,
('67', 102, 11, 20, 171080) Your letter was put into my hands at 3.30 a.m., and after reading it I have immediately sat down to reply to it.
('67', 102, 11, 21, 171193) Shedding tears will not help us to remove the hardships of Savlis women.
('67', 102, 11, 22, 171266) It can be proved that the condition of the Harijan women of Savli is not as bad as you believe it to be.
('67', 102, 11, 23, 171371) Your imagination can carry you too far.
('67', 102, 11, 24, 171411) That faculty needs to be kept under control.
('67', 102, 11, 25, 171456) This world is a sea of misery.
('67', 102, 11, 26, 171487) If we keep thinking of it only we would get drowned in it.
('67', 102, 11, 27, 171546) We should remember that God, who created this world and who rules it is just and, therefore, the sufferings that we imagine do not exist and that, on the balance, happiness reigns, that is, truth alone triumphs.
('67', 102, 11, 28, 171758) Knowing this, we should keep our minds light.
('67', 102, 11, 29, 171804) That will also help us in removing the sufferings.
('67', 102, 11, 30, 171855) If, on the contrary, we magnify the sufferings, we would sink into moha 2 and become incapable of relieving them.

('67', 103, 1, 3, 172101) But I will say one thing.
('67', 103, 1, 4, 172127) It is surely a matter of satisfaction that whereas before the women earned nothing, through spinning they earn something now, however little it may be.
('67', 103, 1, 5, 172279) They do have other income.
('67', 103, 1, 6, 172306) A woman is but one member of a family.
('67', 103, 1, 7, 172345) There are others, too, who earn.
('67', 103, 1, 8, 172378) There are countless women in this country much poorer than they.
('67', 103, 1, 9, 172443) Instead of shedding tears over their poverty, we would steel our hearts while thinking about it and devise measures to eradicate it.

('67', 103, 6, 14, 172719) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('67', 103, 7, 15, 172734) I have now got your yarn.
('67', 103, 7, 16, 172760) It is not bad.
('67', 103, 7, 17, 172775) You should now learn to make properly twisted strands.
('67', 103, 7, 18, 172830) If you do not, the yarn becomes weak.
('67', 103, 7, 19, 172868) I see you have sent a lot of razor blades, some of which are quite new.
('67', 103, 7, 20, 172940) They make up for the postage spent on the yarn.
('67', 103, 7, 21, 172988) Now you should collect a fair quantity before you send a parcel.
('67', 103, 7, 22, 173053) Did you get the packet of envelopes and note paper?
('67', 103, 7, 23, 173105) The expert has [not] yet commenced paper making.
('67', 103, 7, 24, 173154) I put him on to making note paper, etc., out of the stock brought from Indore.
('67', 103, 7, 25, 173233) When he does make paper you shall know.
('67', 103, 7, 26, 173273) Yes, I began about the market in Simla.
('67', 103, 7, 27, 173313) I suggested your personally visiting it and studying the local vegetables and fruit and their quality from the health point of view and at the market knowing the poor who come from distant hills to sell their produce.
('67', 103, 7, 28, 173531) You can also sell paper, khaddar and the like among those who will congregate in Simla.
('67', 103, 7, 29, 173619) I hope you have both already felt the effect of the mountain air.

('67', 104, 3, 4, 173882) MY DEAR MALKANI,
('67', 104, 4, 5, 173899) Your letter of 23rd April which Hariji 1 seems to have resented is none too courteous.
('67', 104, 4, 6, 173986) It is professorial not secretarial (if there is such an adjective).
('67', 104, 4, 7, 174054) A secretary is nothing if he is not pleasant even when he is saying unpleasant things which he has to say far more often than a professor.
('67', 104, 4, 8, 174193) I have written to Bapa to throw cold water on the fire lit by Hariji.
('67', 104, 4, 9, 174263) I am also writing.
('67', 104, 4, 10, 174282) And you may write a polite letter apologizing for any unconsciously discourteous language into using which you might have been betrayed.
('67', 104, 5, 11, 174419) Yours, BAPU [PS.] Have you been sending the list of Pani Fund 2 Donations?

('67', 104, 11, 25, 175119) used the sides of the roads .
('67', 104, 11, 26, 175149) for easing themselves.
('67', 104, 11, 27, 175172) I happened to mention this matter to Bapu and he immediately said: It is our duty to teach these people sanitation and if they wont listen .
('67', 104, 11, 28, 175313) we should clean up .
('67', 104, 11, 29, 175334) . The villagers proved deaf .

('67', 108, 4, 5, 179974) I have read your letter carefully.
('67', 108, 4, 6, 180009) I congratulate you on the faith and firmness which you have put in the khadi work.
('67', 108, 4, 7, 180092) That the Praja Mandal should buy mill carpet rather than khadi carpet is as painful as it is amazing.
('67', 108, 4, 8, 180194) We who have faith in khadi should not, however, give up our faith.

('67', 108, 7, 11, 180350) May 27, 1935
('67', 108, 8, 12, 180363) BALVANTSINHA,
('67', 108, 9, 13, 180377) If you do not see the fault, why should you be troubled?
('67', 108, 9, 14, 180434) Even if a mahatma shows us our faults, we should neither be pained nor repent, so long as we do not see them for ourselves.
('67', 108, 9, 15, 180558) I have not found you untruthful, only indiscreet.
('67', 108, 9, 16, 180608) When you had to travel at public cost, there was no need to go.
('67', 108, 9, 17, 180672) It is also debatable whether your coming from Delhi was in itself proper.
('67', 108, 9, 18, 180746) The same is true about rotis and mangoes.
('67', 108, 9, 19, 180788) All these things should not cause you distress.
('67', 108, 9, 20, 180836) You should only try to understand and try to restrain yourself.
('67', 108, 9, 21, 180900) More when we meet.
('67', 108, 9, 22, 180919) I hope you have put to good use the 12 days that you got.
('67', 108, 10, 23, 180977) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I am returning your letter.

('67', 108, 14, 27, 181114) SHARMA,
('67', 108, 15, 28, 181122) I have your letter.
('67', 108, 15, 29, 181142) I understand you have paid for the books for the present.
('67', 108, 15, 30, 181200) I shall send you the money when the remaining books arrive.
('67', 108, 15, 31, 181260) It is not necessary for you to pay for the books.

('67', 109, 1, 3, 181429) You may continue reading whatever books are available now.
('67', 109, 1, 4, 181488) In the mean time, let us see how the plans about America progress.
('67', 109, 1, 5, 181555) You can certainly come and learn at Wardha.
('67', 109, 1, 6, 181599) All this will depend upon plans regarding America.
('67', 109, 1, 7, 181650) The letter to Dr. Kellogg does not mean that your departure depends upon his reply.
('67', 109, 1, 8, 181734) If the passport was ready, I would certainly send you away on the 31st without waiting for Kelloggs reply.
('67', 109, 1, 9, 181841) The position about the passport is as I explained 1. We cannot move a single step without your application.
('67', 109, 1, 10, 181949) I am at Borsad.
('67', 109, 1, 11, 181965) I shall leave on the 31st and reach Wardha on the 2nd June.
('67', 109, 2, 12, 182025) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] How is your boil?
('67', 109, 2, 13, 182069) What about the court judgment?

('67', 109, 6, 18, 182240) DEAR DAUGHTER, Though you forbade me to write I feel my letter will gladden you.
('67', 109, 6, 19, 182321) I do have some leisure for writing.
('67', 109, 6, 20, 182357) It is pleasing to learn that everything is proceeding smoothly there.
('67', 109, 6, 21, 182427) I hope the Japanese monk is well.

('67', 109, 10, 25, 182544) May 27, 1935 It is a shame that plague should have been endemic here for four years.
('67', 109, 10, 26, 182629) Borsad proper has only a population of 13,000, and the taluka has a population of 1,44,000 to deal with.
('67', 109, 10, 27, 182734) It should not be impossible to abolish plague both from the town and the taluka.
('67', 109, 11, 28, 182815) 1 Vide Letter to H. L. Sharma, 20 5 1935 2 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 110, 0, 1, 182911) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 111
('67', 110, 1, 2, 182958) you cannot do so with only six scavengers for the whole of the town.
('67', 110, 1, 3, 183027) Unless you convert yourselves into Bhangis, unless all of you become voluntary scavengers, plague must come gain, the Sardars and his volunteers efforts notwithstanding.
('67', 110, 1, 4, 183197) In fact the voluntary relief work that has now come to an end adds considerably to your responsibility.
('67', 110, 1, 5, 183301) Unless you follow up the work it will be wasted.
('67', 110, 1, 6, 183350) I have in the past come to you to congratulate you on the pluck with, which you had fought during the civil disobedience movement and on your sufferings and sacrifice.
('67', 110, 1, 7, 183518) But I have come to tell you today that it is not those who can fight the Government that can govern themselves, but those who can show themselves to be equal to calamities like this.
('67', 110, 1, 8, 183701) Let me tell you that ever since I learnt the word swaraj, I have been interesting myself in work of this kind.
('67', 110, 1, 9, 183812) Ever since 1893 when my public life began my principal interest has been this kind of constructive work.
('67', 110, 1, 10, 183917) The fight with the Government came at a very late stage in life.
('67', 110, 1, 11, 183982) But it may be said to be an edifice built on the sure foundation of solid constructive work done through several years.
('67', 110, 1, 12, 184102) I have obeyed and respected every municipal and civic law to the best of my ability, and even the Government that has often imprisoned me knows my capacity for obedience.
('67', 110, 1, 13, 184273) I learnt scavenging for the first time in South Africa, and have ever been laying the greatest stress on the fact that it is work of this kind that qualifies one for swaraj.
('67', 110, 1, 14, 184447) You will not say that after you have won swaraj you can go to sleep, unmindful of these problems.
('67', 110, 1, 15, 184545) Swaraj is not absence of rule.
('67', 110, 1, 16, 184576) You will have to tackle all these problems successfully even after you have won swaraj.
('67', 110, 1, 17, 184664) Remember that the man who made the call for civil disobedience is making the call for work of this essential character.
('67', 110, 1, 18, 184784) Even constructive work like production of khadi and revival of village industries cannot be done unless you have made your bodies and your homes proof against disease, and therefore this sanitation work is the very foundation of all constructive work.

('67', 111, 4, 4, 185188) I got your entertaining letter.
('67', 111, 4, 5, 185220) Ravishankar 1 comes and sees me regularly.
('67', 111, 4, 6, 185263) If the rule he has taught you has gone down the throat and sunk into your heart, you may rest assured that all your problems will be solved.
('67', 111, 4, 7, 185404) Everything will happen when its turn comes.
('67', 111, 4, 8, 185448) You will have Bal and everything else too.
('67', 111, 4, 9, 185491) All feel hunger and thirst, but he who remains cheerful despite them enjoys true happiness.
('67', 111, 4, 10, 185583) Anyone who has got a wooden flute like the one that Mirabehn has should please give it to Amtussalaam.

('67', 111, 10, 18, 185916) Do you think there is anything in it?
('67', 111, 10, 19, 185954) Keshu has gone to Bombay.
('67', 111, 10, 20, 185980) He wants something by way of scholarship.
('67', 111, 10, 21, 186022) I have told Panditji 2 about Gajanan.
('67', 111, 10, 22, 186060) He will have a talk with Gajanan.
('67', 111, 10, 23, 186094) Go on giving 3 for the present.

('67', 112, 2, 3, 186442) Unrevised May 28, 1935
('67', 112, 4, 4, 186465) Why did you have to keep waiting for forty five minutes?
('67', 112, 4, 5, 186522) In any case, I didnt think you would run away.
('67', 112, 4, 6, 186569) Since you were meeting me after a long time, I was eager to ask you a few questions and have a careful look at you.
('67', 112, 4, 7, 186685) Of course you did well to go back to your place of work.
('67', 112, 4, 8, 186742) But I was eager because on that day you had stayed on.
('67', 112, 4, 9, 186797) I am unable to say anything about Aurobindobabu.
('67', 112, 4, 10, 186846) If a man with a flabby body cannot have pure wisdom, what can one say of one who is slim?
('67', 112, 4, 11, 186936) I can only say that my path has borne fruit for me.
('67', 112, 4, 12, 186988) Let us not make ourselves judges of the whole world.
('67', 112, 4, 13, 187041) We should admit that among the slim?
('67', 112, 4, 14, 187078) I can only say that my path has borne fruit for me.
('67', 112, 4, 15, 187130) Let us not make ourselves judges of the whole world.
('67', 112, 4, 16, 187183) We should admit that among thetwo hundred persons living under his wing there are several whose lives have undergone a great transformation through his influence.
('67', 112, 4, 17, 187346) Everybody follows his own natural bent.
('67', 112, 4, 18, 187386) It is not quite correct to say that in the West they do not recognize the necessity of purity in private life, nor is it correct to say that here everybody recognizes it.
('67', 112, 4, 19, 187557) We ourselves not only recognize it, but go further and believe that the actions prompted by a reason not purified inwardly will not endure, however attractive they may appear.
('67', 112, 4, 20, 187733) Such actions cannot be judged from their immediate results.
('67', 112, 4, 21, 187793) It is true, of course, that actions which have no connection with morality do not require inward purity.
('67', 112, 4, 22, 187898) A dissolute carpenter will be able to make a right angled table.
('67', 112, 4, 23, 187963) But a person lacking in purity will not be able to eradicate untouchability or turn the people to the spinning wheel, for both these tasks require qualities of the heart.
('67', 112, 4, 24, 188134) In such activities calculations of time count for little.
('67', 112, 4, 25, 188192) We should have no doubt at all that actions performed with sincere and truthful motives are bound to have certain results.
('67', 112, 4, 26, 188315) If we do not have such faith, we shall never be able to adhere to moral principles.
('67', 112, 4, 27, 188399) God is beyond the reach of human thought.
('67', 112, 4, 28, 188441) The God, therefore, whom we worship is a creation of our imagination.
('67', 112, 4, 29, 188511) Nobody has seen the real God.
('67', 112, 4, 30, 188541) If anybody has seen Him, he has not been able to describe Him.
('67', 112, 4, 31, 188604) It is difficult to say which Form of Him is dearest to
('67', 113, 0, 1, 188659) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 114
('67', 113, 1, 2, 188701) The Form, however, which I worship is known as Truth.
('67', 113, 1, 3, 188755) He both has a manifest form and has none.
('67', 113, 1, 4, 188797) He manifests Himself in innumerable ways.
('67', 113, 1, 5, 188839) How can imperfect man see perfect truth?
('67', 113, 1, 6, 188880) I dont intend to write anything about the jewellery though I have alreay made a note of the point in my diary.
('67', 113, 1, 7, 188991) The additional note which will appear after your letter will be for my information.
('67', 113, 1, 8, 189075) Isnt that what you desire?
('67', 113, 1, 9, 189102) I will use the khadi when it is received.
('67', 113, 1, 10, 189144) Lilavati has arrived here from Rajkot.
('67', 113, 1, 11, 189183) This time her health is excellent.

('67', 113, 6, 18, 189454) MY DEAR KRISHNADAS,
('67', 113, 7, 19, 189474) I did not know that the illegal sessions were counted among the others.
('67', 113, 7, 20, 189546) I think you should take the ruling from Rajendrababu 1 and act as he says.
('67', 113, 7, 21, 189621) If they are counted as sessions, their chairmen undoubtedly become members of A.I.C.C. if they conform to the rule applicable to original members.
('67', 113, 7, 22, 189768) Shri Srinivasa Iyengar is not found in the list because I imagine he has not paid his subscription.
('67', 113, 7, 23, 189868) If the Congress has actually finished 50 years of its life, undoubtedly there should be celebrations on a grand scale.
('67', 113, 7, 24, 189987) The programme requires careful thinking out.
('67', 113, 7, 25, 190032) Confer on this with Rajenbabu.

('67', 114, 4, 5, 190450) The evenings and mornings are delightfully cool.
('67', 114, 4, 6, 190499) Wardha must be a furnace day and night.

('67', 115, 4, 5, 191540) The Harijan Sevak Sangh has a big scheme for digging wells.
('67', 115, 4, 6, 191600) It is planned to construct them with cement.
('67', 115, 4, 7, 191645) Can we expect your help in obtaining it?
('67', 115, 4, 8, 191686) Thakkar Bapa informs me that you had allowed 30 per cent in the Bihar Relief work.
('67', 115, 4, 9, 191769) I assume that you will do whatever is possible in this instance.
('67', 115, 4, 10, 191834) I was told in Borsad that you had called during the few hours I spent in Bombay.
('67', 115, 4, 11, 191915) I was disappointed that we couldn't meet.
('67', 115, 4, 12, 191957) I hope you keep perfect health.

('67', 115, 7, 18, 192155) [May 29, 1935] 1
('67', 115, 8, 19, 192172) SHARMA,
('67', 115, 9, 20, 192180) What can I do?
('67', 115, 9, 21, 192195) You cannot get a passport at Wardha.
('67', 115, 9, 22, 192232) As far as I know, you will get it in Delhi only.
('67', 115, 9, 23, 192281) You will have to apply to the magistrate.
('67', 115, 9, 24, 192323) The Police Commissioner will make inquiries.
('67', 115, 9, 25, 192368) So you have to get an application form and fill it.
('67', 115, 9, 26, 192420) I was hoping that I could take out a passport for you but rules do not permit it.
('67', 115, 9, 27, 192502) I too had to apply and attach a photograph and all this not at Simla but in Bombay.
('67', 115, 9, 28, 192586) The only difference was that, since I had to attend the Round Table Conference, Simla had cleared the way for me.
('67', 115, 9, 29, 192700) They will make many inquiries about you, as they do in all cases.
('67', 115, 9, 30, 192766) This should not cause anything like fear.
('67', 115, 9, 31, 192808) You will often have to come in contact with many such officials.
('67', 115, 9, 32, 192873) More so in America.
('67', 115, 9, 33, 192893) There are inquiries and verifications at every stage, so you must make a start.
('67', 115, 9, 34, 192973) It was a reliable person who wrote to me about the Rs. 5,000. 2
('67', 115, 10, 35, 193037) He does not want to disclose his name.
('67', 115, 10, 36, 193076) It is the same firm.

('67', 116, 1, 3, 193235) Nor does that seem to be his intention.
('67', 116, 1, 4, 193275) When he learnt that I was sending you to America, he wrote to caution me.
('67', 116, 1, 5, 193349) I replied to say that there was no reason for me to be cautious.
('67', 116, 1, 6, 193414) I have written to you as a matter of duty to let you know how people talk about you.
('67', 116, 1, 7, 193499) This should not cause you any worry.
('67', 116, 1, 8, 193536) I understand about joint policy.
('67', 116, 1, 9, 193569) I fear nothing can be done in this matter.
('67', 116, 1, 10, 193612) My writing is not likely to deter anyone from taking out a policy.
('67', 116, 1, 11, 193679) I would not bother about the effect, if writing becomes a duty.
('67', 116, 1, 12, 193743) At present I do not feel called upon to write.

('67', 116, 6, 17, 193930) BHAI KOTWAL,
('67', 116, 7, 18, 193943) I got your letter.
('67', 116, 7, 19, 193962) I have absolved nobody.
('67', 116, 7, 20, 193986) I merely said that if Haribhau and you had misled the members of the Committee, they would be absolved from blame.
('67', 116, 7, 21, 194101) But even though you might have misled them, how can those who accompanied you be absolved?
('67', 116, 7, 22, 194192) As a matter of fact, therefore, nobody is absolved.
('67', 116, 7, 23, 194244) Your atonement lies, first in explaining to the people there what their dharma is, and, secondly, in refusing in future to assume any responsibility beyond your capacity.
('67', 116, 7, 24, 194415) You have no gift for collecting money.
('67', 116, 7, 25, 194454) Since you did not have money, you should not have involved yourself in money matters.
('67', 116, 7, 26, 194540) Except this there is no other atonement.
('67', 116, 7, 27, 194581) It will not matter if you can collect nothing.
('67', 116, 7, 28, 194628) But even if you are offered contributions of a hundred or two hundred rupees, you may accept them.
('67', 116, 7, 29, 194727) Drop by drop the lake fills.

('67', 117, 7, 13, 195275) May 31, 1935
('67', 117, 8, 14, 195288) Today we have assembled for the opening of a girls school.
('67', 117, 8, 15, 195347) I have made a thorough study of child education.
('67', 117, 8, 16, 195396) I could say the same thing about girls education.
('67', 117, 8, 17, 195446) But how can experts accept this?
('67', 117, 8, 18, 195479) Today, even I cannot make that claim.
('67', 117, 8, 19, 195517) In the prevailing state of affairs it is not easy to talk about girls education.
('67', 117, 8, 20, 195598) Everyone may well claim that he is capable of giving education to girls.
('67', 117, 8, 21, 195671) I will however ask him whether he has imparted true education to his daughter or his wife.
('67', 117, 8, 22, 195762) How can he who has not observed his dharma towards his wife, sister, mother or mother in law, set out to teach the daughters or sisters of others?
('67', 117, 8, 23, 195909) They may well become B.A.s or M.A.s but I shall put them to the same test.
('67', 117, 8, 24, 195984) I should like to know what kind of husbands and fathers those who write books on girls education are.
('67', 117, 8, 25, 196086) You will tell me that although this school is to be opened as a memorial to Vithalbhai, I have not yet said anything about him.
('67', 117, 8, 26, 196214) Why should we have a memorial to Vithalbhai in Nadiad?
('67', 117, 8, 27, 196269) His services extended over a vast area.
('67', 117, 8, 28, 196309) He brought credit to the office of the Mayor of the Bombay Corporation.
('67', 117, 8, 29, 196381) Both in Bombay and Simla, he struggled for the nations cause.
('67', 117, 8, 30, 196443) There have always been differences of opinion between Vithalbhai and myself.
('67', 117, 8, 31, 196520) Nevertheless the very same

('67', 118, 0, 1, 196579) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 119
('67', 118, 1, 2, 196626) Vithalbhai sang my praises in America.
('67', 118, 1, 3, 196665) The reason for this was that both of us had one thing in commonthe zeal to live and die for the country.
('67', 118, 1, 4, 196770) He did not keep a pie for himself.
('67', 118, 1, 5, 196805) He bequeathed to the country whatever he had saved.
('67', 118, 1, 6, 196857) When he was earning, he donated Rs. 40,000 the interest on which is still accumulating.
('67', 118, 1, 7, 196945) Is it a childs play to build a memorial to such an individual?
('67', 118, 1, 8, 197008) The ideal of education for girls is not that our girls become like dolls or beautiful dancers but good volunteers.
('67', 118, 1, 9, 197123) As Patidars, you have thought of erecting this memorial.
('67', 118, 1, 10, 197180) God alone knows whether he was a Patidar or not.
('67', 118, 1, 11, 197229) When I first met him, I mistook him for a Muslim because of his fez and his beard.
('67', 118, 1, 12, 197312) I did not even ask him, for it would not be in keeping with my habit.
('67', 118, 1, 13, 197382) How can he who regards everyone as his brother ask about a persons caste or religion!
('67', 118, 1, 14, 197468) If you want to ridicule Vithalbhai by calling him a Patidar, you may well do so.
('67', 118, 1, 15, 197549) Which of the Patidars customs did he observe?
('67', 118, 1, 16, 197595) Which circle of Patidars can absorb him?
('67', 118, 1, 17, 197636) If you want to claim Vithalbhai and Vallabhbhai as your own, thenbe sure that you are doomed.
('67', 118, 1, 18, 197730) If you regard the former as one of you, you will have to regard Dheds, Bhangis and Dharalas as your kinsfolk.
('67', 118, 1, 19, 197840) He never distinguished between Bhangis and Patidars.
('67', 118, 1, 20, 197893) If you want to build a memorial to him, you will have to make this institution such as would do credit not to Kheda but to India and you will have to produce women volunteers who will serve the country.
('67', 118, 1, 21, 198096) If you run this institution with this ideal in view, it will be regarded as a real memorial to Vithalbhai.
('67', 118, 1, 22, 198203) It is not easy to do that.
('67', 118, 1, 23, 198230) However, I have come here on your insistence and because of my blind love for you.
('67', 118, 1, 24, 198313) How could I refuse to come to Kheda district and refuse to open a school when I have a fund of sacred memories of this district, where I went round on horseback and in bullock carts, where I gathered a lot of dust by going on foot, where once I was on my death bed and where volunteers like Fulchand cleaned my bed pan?
('67', 118, 1, 25, 198633) It is true that I was not very enthusiastic about performing this ceremony, for I have burnt my fingers once, but I agreed to do it as I hold the belief that faith moves mountains.

('67', 119, 2, 3, 198946) May 31, 1935
('67', 119, 3, 4, 198959) I feel it is necessary to say two things before we begin our programme for the day.
('67', 119, 3, 5, 199043) Today, on this occasion, I feel the absence of Fulchand 1 and Mohanlal Pandya 2the onion thief.
('67', 119, 3, 6, 199139) I came into contact with both these persons when I was staying at the Nadiad orphanage in 1918 and that relationship lasted till they died.
('67', 119, 3, 7, 199279) I have preserved in my memory many sweet recollections of both.
('67', 119, 3, 8, 199343) I received a heart rending letter from Sardar at the time of Mohanlals death.
('67', 119, 3, 9, 199421) Ordinarily, Sardar has a heart of steel, he can harden his heart to put up with any kind of suffering that befalls him.
('67', 119, 3, 10, 199541) Nevertheless when I came across heart rending phrases in his letter, I realized how much he must have felt at the loss of such a colleague.
('67', 119, 3, 11, 199681) Not only this district, but the entire Gujarat feels his loss.
('67', 119, 3, 12, 199744) These two workers embodied my ideal of silent volunteers.
('67', 119, 3, 13, 199802) Both gave up their lives thinking of their own work.
('67', 119, 3, 14, 199855) I have visited the Bal Mandir which has been built in memory of Fulchand.
('67', 119, 3, 15, 199929) It is natural that you should wish to have a memorial for Mohanlal as well.
('67', 119, 3, 16, 200005) However, it is better if we do not beguile ourselves with such small memorials.
('67', 119, 3, 17, 200085) If we wish to erect a permanent memorial, it cannot be done by spending money on buildings of brick and mortar.
('67', 119, 3, 18, 200197) This does not mean that such memorials should not be built.
('67', 119, 3, 19, 200257) Only we must understand what we intend through the memorial.
('67', 119, 3, 20, 200318) We cannot sit by saying, now he is gone and where are we to find the like of him?
('67', 119, 3, 21, 200400) We are bound to feel sorry at the loss of such workers but their loss should be made good.
('67', 119, 3, 22, 200491) Just as at the death of a king his throne does not remain vacant and we say the king is dead, long live the king, similarly the institution built by workers who are no longer alive should continue to function.
('67', 119, 3, 23, 200701) And a successive line of workers belonging to these should continue.
('67', 119, 3, 24, 200770) Both Fulchand and Mohanlal Pandya were institutions by themselves.
('67', 119, 3, 25, 200837) What would happen to a person like myself if such institutions did not function?
('67', 119, 3, 26, 200918) Or, in other words, no sooner a person who is prepared to face the gallows has departed, than another such person should be ready.
('67', 119, 3, 27, 201049) I would,
('67', 119, 4, 28, 201058) 1 Fulchand Bapuji Shah died on April 19, 1934 2 Mohanlal Kameshvar Pandya died on May 18, 1934.

('67', 120, 1, 2, 201201) therefore, suggest that if we wish to perpetuate the memory of Fulchand and Mohanlal Pandya we may certainly erect buildings but before doing that our task should be to resolve to make all efforts to become like them.
('67', 120, 1, 3, 201419) The poet Shakespeare has said: The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones. The poet has not expressed a universal truth in this but has reproached the world.
('67', 120, 1, 4, 201615) As a matter of fact, Nature does not store rubbish.
('67', 120, 1, 5, 201667) It continues to give out its fragrance after burying or burning up filth.
('67', 120, 1, 6, 201741) Similarly, we should bury any faults in our elders and departed leaders and preserve their virtues.
('67', 120, 1, 7, 201841) The reason is that it is not the former but the latter which is our wealth.
('67', 120, 1, 8, 201917) We are not guilty of any injustice to those like Mohanlal Pandya if we believe that we can excel them.
('67', 120, 1, 9, 202020) Each one of us is born with his own faults.
('67', 120, 1, 10, 202064) It is the dharma of every one of us to rid ourselves of these and to develop our virtues and preserve them.
('67', 120, 1, 11, 202172) To the extent that the world has not been regularly practising this dharma, it has not done credit to its heritage.
('67', 120, 1, 12, 202288) This morning, I visited the Bal Mandir started in memory of Fulchand.
('67', 120, 1, 13, 202358) I was informed by the persons who run it that the transport charges for bringing the children to the school every day came to fifty rupees per month.
('67', 120, 1, 14, 202508) I am acquainted with child education and the Montessori system.
('67', 120, 1, 15, 202572) I have met 1 the learned Madam Montessori.
('67', 120, 1, 16, 202615) I have not taken a single lesson from her and yet she has publicly awarded a certificate to me saying that I fully understand her system and have been practising it.
('67', 120, 1, 17, 202781) This certificate was not by way of false flattery.
('67', 120, 1, 18, 202832) For I had given a certificate to myself at the very outset.
('67', 120, 1, 19, 202892) So, with full knowledge as to what child education is, I say that this expense of fifty rupees seems preposterous to me.
('67', 120, 1, 20, 203013) Spending fifty rupees for making cripples of children is not the Montessori system.
('67', 120, 1, 21, 203097) Those who blindly imitate in this country the way it is practised in Europe are fools.
('67', 120, 1, 22, 203184) And how far will you carry out that imitation?
('67', 120, 1, 23, 203231) According to that system, it is necessary to have a garden along with the school.
('67', 120, 1, 24, 203313) In this school I did not find a garden.
('67', 120, 1, 25, 203353) When I enquired about the distance of the school from the childrens homes, I was informed that it would not be more than a mile.
('67', 120, 1, 26, 203482) I would ask the parents and the teachers to save these fifty rupees.
('67', 120, 1, 27, 203551) Teachers should set out early in the morning and bring the children to the school, leading them by the hand.

('67', 121, 1, 3, 203949) Fulchand was not the person to rest in a bed of flowers.
('67', 121, 1, 4, 204006) He was as hard as steel.
('67', 121, 1, 5, 204031) Hence I would tell the teachers to serve a notice on parents that they should accept your resignation if they cannot send their children on foot, but they should not compel you to make the children helpless.
('67', 121, 1, 6, 204239) Only aged and helpless persons like Nanasaheb 1 go about in carriages.
('67', 121, 1, 7, 204310) I would not do so.
('67', 121, 1, 8, 204329) And if an old man of sixty six does not sit in a carriage, why should you send children of two and a half years in that manner?

('67', 121, 6, 19, 204926) Asked as to why he selected Wardha as his headquarters Gandhiji said: Because Wardha is in the centre of India, and it was in Wardha that I was able to get a rich piece of land with buildings and plenty of water, land worth over two lakhs.
('67', 121, 6, 20, 205166) There are nearly 700 fruit trees on the land.
('67', 121, 6, 21, 205212) I selected Wardha also because Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj was most anxious that the land which he had contemplated as donation for Maganlal Gandhi Memorial should be taken up by the All India Village Industries Association.
('67', 121, 6, 22, 205430) Lastly, Wardha is a half village and half town, and my own desire and that of my associates was that the headquarters should not be selected in any presidency town.
('67', 121, 7, 23, 205595) 1 Gopaldas Vithaldas Desai 2 Gandhiji issued the statement after meeting Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan in Sabarmati Jail in the afternoon.

('67', 122, 1, 2, 205775) was an additional attraction of Vinoba and his band of workers already trained at the Wardha Ashram.
('67', 122, 1, 3, 205876) These were sufficient inducements for all of us for selecting Wardha as headquarters.
('67', 122, 2, 4, 205962) Answering further questions, Gandhiji said that he did not propose to move out of Wardha as far as possible in order that the work might go on in his presence, as the conception was his.
('67', 122, 2, 5, 206149) Moreover, it was advisable that all office bearers of the Association should be in close touch with him and that he might be available,
('67', 122, 3, 6, 206285) whenever any of them wanted his guidance at Wardha.
('67', 122, 3, 7, 206337) They met daily for one and a half hours except on Mondays.
('67', 122, 4, 8, 206396) Asked as to whether it was a fact that he had left Gujarat because he was dissatisfied with her, Gandhiji said that that was altogether a wrong notice.
('67', 122, 4, 9, 206548) [He said:] It is not without considerable pain that I am just now physically cut off from Gujarat, though, in other respects, I am in constant touch with her work.
('67', 122, 5, 10, 206712) Replying to another question, Gandhiji said that he wished he could stay in Gujarat for the Village Industries work, but he was afraid that Gujarat was far too commercialized for doing spade work with better prospects of success than elsewhere.
('67', 122, 5, 11, 206957) Gandhiji was of opinion that villages in Gujarat were more touched by that commercial spirit than elsewhere.

('67', 122, 7, 14, 207125) May 31, 1935
('67', 122, 8, 15, 207138) What should be the attitude of a woman towards her family?
('67', 122, 8, 16, 207197) To what extent can she maintain her individuality in the family?
('67', 122, 8, 17, 207262) There is not the slightest doubt that wives have all the rights which husbands enjoy.
('67', 122, 8, 18, 207348) Their duties are different but their rights are the same.
('67', 122, 8, 19, 207406) If a woman sets out in shirt and trousers with a gun in her hand, a man has no right to stop her.
('67', 122, 8, 20, 207504) In such matters men and women enjoy equal rights.
('67', 122, 8, 21, 207554) A husband cannot compel his wife to go to a cinema against her wishes or if she wishes to go out by herself, he cannot prevent her.
('67', 122, 8, 22, 207686) In other words, in things which have to be done jointlythe greater the amount of co operation and unanimity the better it is.
('67', 122, 8, 23, 207812) This co operation is not a one sided affair.
('67', 122, 8, 24, 207857) It cannot be measured.
('67', 122, 8, 25, 207880) The husband saying, I am your master, you are my property, you should do as I tell you is the kind of thing that has no place in my ideology.
('67', 122, 8, 26, 208022) Satyagraha is the final weapon against such
('67', 122, 9, 27, 208066) 1 The questions were asked by members of Jyoti Sangh, an institution for women's welfare.
('67', 123, 0, 1, 208156) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 124
('67', 123, 1, 2, 208198) attitude in husbands.
('67', 123, 1, 3, 208220) A woman too can resort to it.
('67', 123, 1, 4, 208250) It is both a single edged and a double edged sword.
('67', 123, 1, 5, 208302) It can be used anywhere with success.
('67', 123, 1, 6, 208340) The husband has no alternative but to give in before this strength of love.
('67', 123, 1, 7, 208416) Although I am pointing out this path of loveof satyagrahato the woman who wishes to assert her own personality before her husband, it is as the poet Pritam has said the flame of the fire.
('67', 123, 1, 8, 208604) She will have to walk in it and that too bare footed, not with shoes on.
('67', 123, 2, 9, 208677) With reference to removing the economic dependence of women, Gandhiji said: I can point out many ways of removing the economic dependence of women.
('67', 123, 2, 10, 208825) The easiest way to this is for every woman to take up some form of work.
('67', 123, 2, 11, 208898) It is not as if the educated women of today were independent.
('67', 123, 2, 12, 208960) They are equally dependent.
('67', 123, 2, 13, 208988) But this is a problem that concerns only the city women and high caste women.
('67', 123, 2, 14, 209066) I have travelled in villages and have seen numerous women enjoying economic independence.
('67', 123, 2, 15, 209156) These women do more work than men.
('67', 123, 2, 16, 209191) But women get less wages.
('67', 123, 2, 17, 209217) Truly speaking, both men and women should get equal wages.
('67', 123, 2, 18, 209276) That is womens right.
('67', 123, 2, 19, 209298) It is only fair.
('67', 123, 2, 20, 209315) If Jyoti Sangh could achieve this, one could say it had brought forth a new principle in the world.
('67', 123, 2, 21, 209415) Now we have to find out what our work should be.
('67', 123, 2, 22, 209464) Of the crores of women, how many of you are going to become B.A.s and M.A.s?
('67', 123, 2, 23, 209541) But let me inform you that crores of women in India enjoy economic freedom.
('67', 123, 2, 24, 209617) I have to find out how many in Ahmedabad do so.
('67', 123, 2, 25, 209665) It is difficult for the Jyoti Sangh to remove their financial dependence.
('67', 123, 2, 26, 209739) For peasant women it is not so.
('67', 123, 2, 27, 209771) We do not enjoy the right which they enjoy.
('67', 123, 2, 28, 209815) It is the Brahmins and Banias who have to fight for the right of divorce.
('67', 123, 2, 29, 209889) Other communities have long been enjoying this right.
('67', 123, 2, 30, 209943) Hence, I ask you not to pity them unnecessarily.
('67', 123, 2, 31, 209992) Only you city dwellers are dependent.
('67', 123, 2, 32, 210030) All of us have to work in the way bricks are put together one upon another.
('67', 123, 2, 33, 210106) You should work within the scope set for your work and bring credit to it.
('67', 123, 2, 34, 210181) You can invite those who wish to take an active part in national and social activities.
('67', 123, 2, 35, 210269) I bless you that you may succeed in your endeavours.
('67', 123, 2, 36, 210322) But for this many women will have to become martyrs to this cause and become ascetics.
('67', 123, 2, 37, 210409) This is no play and if it is that at all, it is like that of the tight rope walker who is able to keep himself straight like a stick only when he concentrates fully, keeps his eyes fixed on a particular point and is fully attuned to the tunes of the shehnai and the drum.
('67', 123, 2, 38, 210681) You shall be able to achieve something only if you work with such concentration.
('67', 123, 3, 39, 210762) With reference to the duties of women, Gandhiji said:
('67', 124, 0, 1, 210816) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 125
('67', 124, 1, 2, 210863) The duty of a woman is to look after what in English is called the hearth and home.
('67', 124, 1, 3, 210947) Man has never performed this task.
('67', 124, 1, 4, 210982) He has been content to build forts and ramparts for protection.
('67', 124, 1, 5, 211046) Will he come forward to protect the home?
('67', 124, 1, 6, 211088) And even if he does so, what sort of protection will he offer?
('67', 124, 1, 7, 211151) Even in a home he will build fortresses and walls.
('67', 124, 1, 8, 211202) He will make holes within these to fire bullets from and put glass and nails on walls.
('67', 124, 1, 9, 211289) In the end, the children of the house will meet their death by climbing upon these.
('67', 124, 1, 10, 211373) But we have to bring credit to the home.
('67', 124, 1, 11, 211414) Hence it is my confirmed opinion that women should get a distinct kind of education.
('67', 124, 1, 12, 211499) The two have separate spheres of activity and their training, therefore, should also be different.
('67', 124, 1, 13, 211598) This does not imply that the work of the one is inferior while that of the other is superior; the spheres of the two are complementary.
('67', 124, 2, 14, 211734) [From Gujarati] Gujarati, 16 6 1935
('67', 124, 3, 15, 211770) 197. STRUGGLES OF A WORKER
('67', 124, 4, 16, 211797) I am conducting, with the co operation of some comrades, an ashram; its object is to so train ourselves as to be transformed into ideal peasants, so that we may be able to completely identify ourselves with village people and village society, and thus be able to serve them by being actually of them.
('67', 124, 4, 17, 212098) With this end in view, agriculture has been taken up as the chief means of support with spinning and weaving as supplementary .
('67', 124, 5, 18, 212226) While starting the ashram, it had been conceived that along with the working out of the ideal of ourselves living a self supporting peasant life, we should also serve the villagers by doing Harijan work, by introducing spinning and in other possible ways.
('67', 124, 5, 19, 212482) But we have been entirely disappointed in this respect, for we have not been as yet able to find a suitable locality for the ashram.
('67', 124, 5, 20, 212615) In the locality wherein the ashram is at present situated the hamlets consist of one or two houses; and these hamlets are separated from one another by a distance of from half a mile to one mile.
('67', 124, 6, 21, 212811) Another thing that has seriously impeded the progress of the ashram is that I committed grave blunders, as I now find them to be, in the matter of diet.
('67', 124, 6, 22, 212964) In what now seems to be a mere over enthusiasm for the ideal of poverty, the standard of diet was kept very low.
('67', 124, 6, 23, 213077) The ashram, for instance, did not even use vegetables regularly .
('67', 124, 6, 24, 213143) Milk and milk products were considered a luxury .
('67', 124, 6, 25, 213193) All this has seriously crippled the health of the inmates.
('67', 124, 6, 26, 213252) The ashram started with twelve inmates; we are now only five .
('67', 124, 7, 27, 213315) The ashram has up till now stuck to the ideal of maintaining itself by manual labour .
('67', 124, 8, 28, 213402) Friends and sympathizers as well as critics set this our insistence on the Tolstoyan idea of bread labour in opposition to the ideal of social service, and argue
('67', 125, 0, 1, 213564) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 126
('67', 125, 1, 2, 213606) that the ashram has thus deprived society of the benefits of the many services that the ashram workers would have been otherwise in a position to render to it.
('67', 125, 1, 3, 213766) How and when, if at all, can one be justified in compromising the principle of bread labour for the sake of rendering social service?
('67', 125, 1, 4, 213900) Is not, most often, the conflict between being and doing only apparent and superficial, while in truth, being is doing in the real sense?
('67', 125, 2, 5, 214038) the board per head per month has been Rs. 3 and other expenses including clothing Re.
('67', 125, 2, 6, 214124) 1 per head per month.
('67', 125, 2, 7, 214146) This is from a letter 1 addressed to Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala by a highly educated selfless worker.
('67', 125, 2, 8, 214248) It depicts the struggles of a sincere worker and is likely to help all who are trying to lead a life of service.
('67', 125, 2, 9, 214361) The effort is noble.
('67', 125, 2, 10, 214382) The writer and his co workers do not hesitate to own and mend mistakes when they discover any.
('67', 125, 2, 11, 214477) I do not know how Shri Kishorelal has answered the queries put by his correspondent.
('67', 125, 2, 12, 214562) I must try to answer them in order to help the general reader who is interested in the questions of the type that puzzle the writer of the letter.
('67', 125, 2, 13, 214709) There seems to be some confusion about the principle of bread labour.
('67', 125, 2, 14, 214779) It is never opposed to social service.
('67', 125, 2, 15, 214818) Intelligent bread labour is any day the highest form of social service.
('67', 125, 2, 16, 214890) For what can be better than that a man should by his personal labour add to the useful wealth of the country?
('67', 125, 2, 17, 215000) Being is doing.
('67', 125, 2, 18, 215016) The adjective intelligent has been prefixed to labour in order to show that labour to be social service must have that definite purpose behind it.
('67', 125, 2, 19, 215163) Otherwise every labourer can be said to render social service.
('67', 125, 2, 20, 215226) He does in a way, but what is meant here is something much more than that.
('67', 125, 2, 21, 215301) A person who labours for the general good of all serves society and is worthy of his hire.
('67', 125, 2, 22, 215392) Therefore, such bread labour is not different from social service.
('67', 125, 2, 23, 215459) What the vast mass of mankind does for self or at best for family, a social servant does for general good.
('67', 125, 2, 24, 215566) These seven members today find that they have hardly time left for service other than that of slaving for their daily bread.
('67', 125, 2, 25, 215691) This need not be so if they were proficient in their work.
('67', 125, 2, 26, 215750) In fact they are not.
('67', 125, 2, 27, 215772) As field labourers, they are no match for the ordinary labourers.
('67', 125, 2, 28, 215838) As artisans too they are novices.
('67', 125, 2, 29, 215872) Every worker, thank God, now knows that with intelligent use of his tools a spinner can easily double his output in a given time.
('67', 125, 2, 30, 216002) That means doubling the income from the wheel.
('67', 125, 2, 31, 216049) This is true of most things.
('67', 125, 2, 32, 216078) In agriculture, the field for development with the same tools is so vast that unless Nature
('67', 125, 3, 33, 216170) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('67', 126, 0, 1, 216207) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 127
('67', 126, 1, 2, 216254) interferes, a farmer can by the use of his intelligence any day quadruple his income, working the same number of hours per day.
('67', 126, 1, 3, 216382) This means that for the same amount of income he need not labour so much as he is now doing.
('67', 126, 1, 4, 216475) These workers can, therefore, when they have acquired proficiency, earn their bread in much less time than they need now, and will have energy set free for special Harijan or other service.
('67', 126, 1, 5, 216665) The problem becomes complicated for householders who have many calls on their purses, but a self denying worker whose needs amount to Rs. 4 per month has any day ample time at his disposal for work beyond labour that would bring him Rs. 4 per month.
('67', 126, 1, 6, 216915) But will three rupees per month needed out of four for food give a person enough to feed himself?
('67', 126, 1, 7, 217013) If Dr. Tilaks figure for Bombay, i.e., Rs. 5 per month, is good, Rs. 3 for village life is certainly good.
('67', 126, 1, 8, 217120) And when I add my own experience to Dr. Tilaks prescription there is no difficulty.
('67', 126, 1, 9, 217204) Dr. Tilak erases powdered milk from the village menu.
('67', 126, 1, 10, 217258) But as he says there is no escape from milk.
('67', 126, 1, 11, 217303) The inmates were wrong in eliminating milk from their dietary.
('67', 126, 1, 12, 217366) It is true that millions get not a drop of milk.
('67', 126, 1, 13, 217415) But they do not get many other things without which we dare not do if we are to live to serve.
('67', 126, 1, 14, 217510) We must therefore take those bare necessaries which we have to strive every villager to produce for himself.
('67', 126, 1, 15, 217619) Whole cereal, whether wheat, rice, bajri, juwar or the like, green edible leaves uncooked, milk, and any village fruit when in season such as mango, amrood, jamun, ber, etc., are indispensable for healthy life.
('67', 126, 1, 16, 217830) The prince among edible leaves is perhaps neem leaves, to be had for the picking everywhere in India; and there are many edible grasses of which we have no knowledge.
('67', 126, 1, 17, 217997) And tamarind fruit which is also obtainable everywhere is not to be despised.
('67', 126, 1, 18, 218075) There is, however, a prejudice against tamarind which is difficult to understand.
('67', 126, 1, 19, 218157) I have been using it liberally in the place of the expensive lemon with the greatest advantage.
('67', 126, 1, 20, 218253) Diet reform is a limitless field of research, fraught with the greatest consequences for the world and more especially for the famishing millions of India.
('67', 126, 1, 21, 218409) It means both health and wealth which according to Ruskin are one and the same thing.
('67', 126, 1, 22, 218495) The members of the little ashram are right in thinking that they will do the greatest social service by living right all along the line.
('67', 126, 1, 23, 218632) They will infect their surroundings whose limit may in course of time be the whole of India and then the universe.
('67', 126, 1, 24, 218747) In this service the welfare of one is the welfare of all.

('67', 128, 4, 8, 220629) How about your slivers?
('67', 128, 4, 9, 220653) Yes, I know the Khambhattas very well indeed.
('67', 128, 4, 10, 220699) They are both very good workers.

('67', 130, 7, 16, 223926) You may debit my account for books and other expenses and credit it, for the time being, with the amount saved on evidence.

('67', 132, 6, 14, 226598) The return journey was a bit trying.
('67', 132, 6, 15, 226635) We barely got sitting accommodation at Bhusaval.

('67', 133, 4, 7, 227409) But I wish to write to you something else.
('67', 133, 4, 8, 227452) We should act in this spirit, namely, we should not want something which others need.
('67', 133, 4, 9, 227538) We have love, but never attachment, for khadi.
('67', 133, 4, 10, 227585) Nor do we have the pride that we are the best workers.
('67', 133, 4, 11, 227640) Therefore we should leave Borkamata if we cannot work there smoothly.
('67', 133, 4, 12, 227710) Besides this, I have said another thing.
('67', 133, 4, 13, 227751) We are no more traders.
('67', 133, 4, 14, 227775) We seek the spread of khadias a means of self help.
('67', 133, 4, 15, 227827) The production of khadi for sale has not much significance.
('67', 133, 4, 16, 227887) We cannot vindicate the message of khadi with the help of commercial khadi, and such khadi is bound to vanish.
('67', 133, 4, 17, 227998) In spite of this, I would say that you should follow your inclinations as long as you are not convinced of this truth.That is why I have written to Jerajani and Banker.

('67', 133, 9, 23, 228363) DEAR COL.
('67', 133, 9, 24, 228373) SOKHEY 2,
('67', 133, 10, 25, 228383) As you may be aware, in company with Sardar Patel I visited several villages of Borsad Taluka and saw the houses in those villages specially with a view to test the possibility of effectively using calcid for the destruction of rats and fleas.
('67', 133, 10, 26, 228627) I could see at a glance that such destruction was well nigh impossible unless you hold that calcid pumped into brick houses with storeys which are not air proof will reach every nook and corner and the burrows under floors.
('67', 133, 10, 27, 228851) Nor is it

('67', 134, 1, 2, 228968) possible to denude the houses of huge earthen or mud jars under and round which mice and rats take shelter.
('67', 134, 1, 3, 229076) The only thing effective in these cases seems to me to make the floors of all houses rat proof.
('67', 134, 1, 4, 229172) This was the method devised successfully in South Africa when the plague made its first appearance there.
('67', 134, 1, 5, 229278) The device was to tear open all cutcha floors without disturbing the super structure and make them pucka and rat proof.
('67', 134, 1, 6, 229398) This was easily and cheaply done by a liberal use of stone or brick and cement.
('67', 134, 1, 7, 229478) Dr. Bhasker Patel has [after] consultation with an experienced house contractor devised several cheap methods of floor renewal so as to make floors rat proof.
('67', 134, 1, 8, 229637) Leaflets have already been issued for the purpose.
('67', 134, 1, 9, 229688) If you can approve of the method, it will receive additional impetus and might be perfected under your kind guidance.
('67', 134, 1, 10, 229806) If you have anything further to say on behalf of the use of calcid or to criticize the method adopted of making houses rat proof you will please not hesitate to send your criticism freely.
('67', 134, 1, 11, 229995) Both the Sardar and I would welcome any criticism or advice you may have to offer.
('67', 134, 1, 12, 230078) I may add that the agent for calcid who went to Borsad whilst I was there opined to Dr. Patel after visiting a few houses that the calcid treatment is not applicable to them.
('67', 134, 1, 13, 230253) I discovered too that a judicious use of the special emulsion prepared by Dr. Bhasker Patel followed by sulphur fumigation had proved most effective for the destruction [of] fleas.
('67', 134, 1, 14, 230434) I must not omit to mention how grateful both Sardar and I were to you for showing us round the Institute with so much care.

('67', 135, 6, 13, 231456) June 5, 1935
('67', 135, 7, 14, 231469) PRABHAVATI,
('67', 135, 8, 15, 231481) I got your letter.
('67', 135, 8, 16, 231500) I am writing to Jayaprakash.
('67', 135, 8, 17, 231529) Send on the letter to him.
('67', 135, 8, 18, 231556) You have done your best.
('67', 135, 8, 19, 231581) You should still go on writing to him.
('67', 135, 8, 20, 231620) If he doesnt take care of his health, what can you do?
('67', 135, 8, 21, 231675) When your one year is over, we shall certainly have to think about your future.
('67', 135, 8, 22, 231755) It will probably be desirable then that you should stay with Jayaprakash.
('67', 135, 8, 23, 231829) Cook for him and take care of his health.
('67', 135, 8, 24, 231871) But it is too early to think about that just now.
('67', 135, 8, 25, 231921) My weight has remained steady.
('67', 135, 8, 26, 231952) It is extremely hot here.
('67', 135, 8, 27, 231978) See that your health is not affected there.
('67', 135, 8, 28, 232022) It will indeed be good if you can go to Sitabadiyara for three or four days.
('67', 135, 8, 29, 232099) It was indeed good that you went and stayed with Jayaprakash for a few days.
('67', 135, 8, 30, 232176) Your leave has been sanctioned.
('67', 135, 8, 31, 232208) Return on the next day after the wedding.
('67', 135, 8, 32, 232250) Make the wedding as simple as possible.
('67', 135, 8, 33, 232290) The only newcomer here is Chitre.
('67', 135, 8, 34, 232324) Amtussalaam will remain here for the present.

('67', 136, 2, 3, 232613) WARDHAGANJ June 6, 1935 1
('67', 136, 3, 4, 232639) When a man is down, he prays to God to lift him up.
('67', 136, 3, 5, 232691) He is the Help of the helpless, says a Tamil proverb.
('67', 136, 3, 6, 232745) The appalling disaster 2 in Quetta paralyses one.
('67', 136, 3, 7, 232795) It baffles all attempt at reconstruction.
('67', 136, 3, 8, 232837) The whole truth about the disaster will perhaps never be known.
('67', 136, 3, 9, 232901) The dead cannot be recalled to life.
('67', 136, 3, 10, 232938) Human effort must be there always.
('67', 136, 3, 11, 232973) Those who are left behind must have help.
('67', 136, 3, 12, 233015) Such reconstruction as is possible will no doubt beundertaken.
('67', 136, 3, 13, 233078) All this and much more along the same line can never be a substitute for prayer.
('67', 136, 3, 14, 233159) But why pray at all?
('67', 136, 3, 15, 233180) Does not God, if there be One, know what has happened?
('67', 136, 3, 16, 233235) Does He stand in need of prayer to enable Him to do His duty?
('67', 136, 3, 17, 233297) No, God needs no reminder.
('67', 136, 3, 18, 233324) He is within everyone.
('67', 136, 3, 19, 233347) Nothing happens without His permission.
('67', 136, 3, 20, 233387) Our prayer is a heart search.
('67', 136, 3, 21, 233417) It is a reminder to ourselves that we are helpless without His support.
('67', 136, 3, 22, 233489) No effort is complete without prayer, without a definite recognition that the best human endeavour is of no effect if it has not Gods blessing behind it.
('67', 136, 3, 23, 233643) Prayer is a call to humility.
('67', 136, 3, 24, 233673) It is a call to self purification, to inward search.
('67', 136, 3, 25, 233726) I must repeat what I said at the time of the Bihar disaster 3. There is a divine purpose behind every physical calamity.
('67', 136, 3, 26, 233847) That perfected science will one day be able to tell us beforehand when earthquakes will occur, as it tells us today of eclipses, is quite possible.
('67', 136, 3, 27, 233995) It will be another triumph of the human mind.
('67', 136, 3, 28, 234041) But such triumphs even indefinitely multiplied can bring about no purification of self without which nothing is of any value.
('67', 136, 3, 29, 234167) Of course we will forget this latest calamity as we have forgotten the Bihar one.
('67', 136, 3, 30, 234249) I ask those who appreciate the necessity of inward purification to join in the prayer that we may read the purpose of God behind such visitations, that they may humble us and prepare us to face our Maker whenever the call comes, and that we may be ever ready to share the sufferings of our fellows whoever they may be.

('67', 137, 3, 4, 234795) DEAR MR. MIEVILLE.
('67', 137, 4, 5, 234814) All differences vanish in the midst of the awful calamity in Quetta 2 following almost in the wake of Bihar.
('67', 137, 4, 6, 234923) I got the enclosed from Hyderabad today to which I sent a reply 3, copy of which is also enclosed herewith.
('67', 137, 4, 7, 235031) Hardly had I sent the reply when the voice within told me that I must enforce in my own action what I had advised Shri Jairamdas and Prof.
('67', 137, 4, 8, 235170) Kripalaniboth Congress secretaries.
('67', 137, 4, 9, 235206) Hence this private approach to the highest authority.
('67', 137, 4, 10, 235260) If I am permitted, I should love to proceed to Quetta myself and do whatever is possible.
('67', 137, 4, 11, 235350) My submission is that a small relief committee should be formed comprising all sections to concert measures of relief.
('67', 137, 4, 12, 235469) In my opinion it is necessary to take the public into confidence about everything that may be done regarding alleviation of distress.
('67', 137, 4, 13, 235603) Will you please put this before His Excellency and if possible wire reply as to permission for me to proceed to Quetta?
('67', 137, 4, 14, 235723) If the permission is granted, it should include sufficient member[s] to enable me to do effective work.

('67', 137, 8, 20, 235994) June 6, 1935
('67', 137, 9, 21, 236007) MY DEAR MALKANI, I had your letter in Borsad.
('67', 137, 9, 22, 236053) Strange, Thakkar Bapa had complained before your letter and had seen me.
('67', 137, 9, 23, 236126) He had a grievance
('67', 137, 10, 24, 236145) 1 A copy of this letter and a copy each of the enclosures mentioned in it were sent to Dr. Rajendra Prasad by Mahadev Desai with a forwarding note dated June 7, 1935. 2 Quetta had been rocked by a severe earthquake on May 31, 1935. 3 Vide Draft Telegram to Jairamdas Doulatram, 6 6 1935

('67', 138, 1, 2, 236479) against me.
('67', 138, 1, 3, 236491) He thought that I had accepted your one sided complaints.
('67', 138, 1, 4, 236549) I told him my wire was independent of what you had said and that I had prejudged nothing.
('67', 138, 1, 5, 236639) In any case you and I have to take things calmly.
('67', 138, 1, 6, 236689) Thakkar Bapa means nothing even when he says a lot.
('67', 138, 1, 7, 236741) It is the vent he needs for bottled up rage over things real or imaginary.
('67', 138, 1, 8, 236816) My advice is: Think nothing of what he says!
('67', 138, 1, 9, 236861) And do as he wishes even when there is conflict of opinion.
('67', 138, 1, 10, 236921) We must not let him be soured.
('67', 138, 1, 11, 236952) Do act as if he was still in office.
('67', 138, 1, 12, 236989) I hope your wound is completely healed.
('67', 138, 2, 13, 237029) Yours, BAPU

('67', 138, 5, 16, 237095) June 6, 1935
('67', 138, 7, 17, 237108) I have sent both your letters to Bhai 1. His postcard to you was bad.
('67', 138, 7, 18, 237178) I have written to him about it.
('67', 138, 7, 19, 237210) This chapter is becoming more and more painful.
('67', 138, 7, 20, 237258) It is good that you have shed your fear of Bhai.
('67', 138, 7, 21, 237307) You say that you wish to abide by my advice.
('67', 138, 7, 22, 237352) Is it in all matters?
('67', 138, 7, 23, 237374) If that is so, you should give up your idea of marrying in the Modh caste.
('67', 138, 7, 24, 237449) I would certainly get you married in a good family where you would be completely happy.
('67', 138, 7, 25, 237537) Your happiness would be the sole consideration in the selection I would make.
('67', 138, 7, 26, 237615) Harilal has been writing to me frightful things.
('67', 138, 7, 27, 237664) Personally, I should like you to be with me just now.
('67', 138, 7, 28, 237718) I am inquiring about what Harilal has writen to me.
('67', 138, 7, 29, 237770) I need your help in that too.
('67', 138, 7, 30, 237800) But I would like you to come only if you would like to stay with me.
('67', 138, 7, 31, 237869) It is quite clear that if you have grown more fond of luxuries, I cannot satisfy your desires.
('67', 138, 7, 32, 237964) Therefore do what will please you.
('67', 138, 7, 33, 237999) Whatever you write to me, do so frankly.
('67', 138, 7, 34, 238040) You are a free person.

('67', 139, 4, 7, 238415) I will soon end this chapter.
('67', 139, 4, 8, 238445) Meanwhile you will have to put up with a little infliction.
('67', 139, 4, 9, 238505) I had a talk with Keshu.
('67', 139, 4, 10, 238530) He must have come there by now.

('67', 139, 4, 12, 238631) He is going to learn motor car and radio repairing.
('67', 139, 4, 13, 238683) I understand from him that he will secure some help in Bombay.
('67', 139, 4, 14, 238746) I see that we shall have to bear the expenses of Santok 1 and Radha.
('67', 139, 4, 15, 238815) I forgot to ask Keshu whether the research which he has made so far would now become useless.
('67', 139, 4, 16, 238909) Thus sometimes important matters are left out when I have to finish our discussion in a short time.
('67', 139, 4, 17, 239009) Please have me clarify the points which I may have left unclear.

('67', 141, 4, 11, 241385) For if there was any even the presence of Rajkumari as the medium of communication between us would not have prevented you from writing.
('67', 141, 4, 12, 241522) Here is a copy of my correspondence with the Viceroy.
('67', 141, 4, 13, 241576) It is purely for your information, not for any action thereon.
('67', 141, 4, 14, 241639) Things will take their own course.
('67', 141, 4, 15, 241674) The most probable thing is that they will allow nobody to go there.
('67', 141, 5, 16, 241742) I hope your book 3 is making good progress and that you are keeping well.
('67', 141, 5, 17, 241816) Love BAPU

('67', 141, 7, 21, 242016) Military authorities disallow entry men.
('67', 141, 7, 22, 242057) Jamshed Mehta and even title holders refused permission though prepared own arrangements and not draw on local resources.
('67', 141, 7, 23, 242179) Much life property could have been saved.
('67', 141, 7, 24, 242221) Possible danger epidemics avoided if adequte labour imported and public offers co operation accepted.
('67', 141, 7, 25, 242323) Whole population including injured being evacuated.
('67', 141, 7, 26, 242375) Rumours rife about abandoning excavated and burning city with petrol.
('67', 141, 7, 27, 242445) All 20,000 lying under assumed dead after only three days.
('67', 141, 7, 28, 242504) Public feel even now life property can be saved if immediate public co operation Sind Punjab India accepted.
('67', 141, 7, 29, 242613) Public meetings Sind condemn attitude authorities.

('67', 142, 2, 3, 243038) June 7, 1935
('67', 142, 3, 4, 243051) MY DEAR AMRIT, I see why your body wears itself out.
('67', 142, 3, 5, 243104) You insist on doing everything thoroughly.
('67', 142, 3, 6, 243147) Of course it is the right thing for any seeker.
('67', 142, 3, 7, 243195) But there is no warrant for any seeker taking over more than he or she can well manage.
('67', 142, 3, 8, 243283) I wonder whether I was right in letting you come into my movements.
('67', 142, 3, 9, 243351) God will take care of you.
('67', 142, 3, 10, 243378) You must cut down the social functions of Simla even though it may involve some seeming sacrifice of the good you might do to the movements you may be in.
('67', 142, 3, 11, 243533) No movement designed for the multitude will suffer by your conserving your time and energy by cutting down many social functions.
('67', 142, 3, 12, 243663) Now for khadi.
('67', 142, 3, 13, 243678) All Punjab shops are not run at a loss.
('67', 142, 3, 14, 243718) The Simla one has always been.
('67', 142, 3, 15, 243749) Management is no doubt defective.
('67', 142, 3, 16, 243783) But the people in Simla look down upon khadi and there is a class that is afraid to wear it.
('67', 142, 3, 17, 243876) The wearers become marked men.
('67', 142, 3, 18, 243907) Your idea of having a swadeshi mart on the Mall is attractive but its execution is risky.
('67', 142, 3, 19, 243997) However good swadeshi articles may be, they must suffer in comparison.
('67', 142, 3, 20, 244068) And I doubt the utility of aiming at gaudiness.
('67', 142, 3, 21, 244116) I differentiate between art and gaudiness.
('67', 142, 3, 22, 244159) What one sees in fashionable shop windows is by no means all art.
('67', 142, 3, 23, 244225) To produce things of real beauty and hope to put them side by side with the showy things of the Mall in Simla is an expensive ambition which we had better suppress at least for this season.
('67', 142, 3, 24, 244415) Do what you can with the shop as it is.
('67', 142, 3, 25, 244455) Convert it into something better.
('67', 142, 3, 26, 244489) Let there be swadeshi articles in it.
('67', 142, 3, 27, 244527) Arrange it after your taste and gain experiencebefore you take expensive quarters.
('67', 142, 3, 28, 244610) We must have this as one of the topics of discussion when you come down in July or Augustthe earlier the better.
('67', 142, 3, 29, 244723) You will read what I have felt and done about the Quetta disaster.
('67', 142, 3, 30, 244790) 1 You will read my letter 2 to Charlie.
('67', 142, 3, 31, 244830) He should know that one swallow does not make a summer.
('67', 142, 3, 32, 244886) He will have to trace me in Orissa or some such place when I take up walking again.
('67', 142, 3, 33, 244970) Meantime I accept 12 miles on the hills as a fair beginning.
('67', 142, 3, 34, 245031) I am waiting for the analysis of falsa 3.

('67', 143, 6, 13, 245660) Enclosed are two letters.
('67', 143, 6, 14, 245686) Read them carefully.
('67', 143, 6, 15, 245707) Both of you brothers sit together, think over the matter and let me have your view.

('67', 143, 11, 28, 246183) BHAI PURUSHOTTAMDAS,
('67', 143, 12, 29, 246204) I understand what you say.
('67', 143, 12, 30, 246231) I only want to know what is possible under the present circumstances.
('67', 143, 12, 31, 246301) What should we do to bring about the adoption of a monetary policy that would be in the interest of the country?
('67', 143, 12, 32, 246414) I leave aside the argument that we should go on doing our best.
('67', 143, 12, 33, 246478) Doing ones best is not enough when a cloud is actually threatening.
('67', 143, 12, 34, 246546) How much do you think the efforts of the people of Quetta must have availed against the recent earthquake there?
('67', 143, 12, 35, 246659) According to me, a political earthquake is going on in the country just now and we seem helpless against it.
('67', 143, 12, 36, 246768) I am therefore taking care of the future.
('67', 143, 13, 37, 246810) 1 The names have been omitted.

('67', 144, 4, 7, 247220) 227. TRUE KINSHIP
('67', 144, 5, 8, 247238) Those educated men who are conducting ashrams or are desirous of living in villages and have their physical constitutions disabled or ruined for want of use and find it difficult to do work involving physical labour and would yet be village workers, complain that unless they have at least one companion with them, they would feel lonely.
('67', 144, 5, 9, 247577) Those who would turn ashrams into colonies of farmers, dairymen and artisans, would do well to employ labour and treat the men and women so employed as if they were members of the ashram.
('67', 144, 5, 10, 247765) Thus they will understand the domestic and economic condition of their employees and will take them only if the wages paid would at all meet their wants.
('67', 144, 5, 11, 247919) They would interest themselves in their lives as they would if they were ashramites.
('67', 144, 5, 12, 248004) Labourers thus treated are likely to more than repay the wages taken by them.
('67', 144, 5, 13, 248082) It will be found that under such treatment the labourers will respond to the affection so lavishly bestowed upon them.
('67', 144, 5, 14, 248201) Under this scheme the founder will live his own life and the labourers theirs.
('67', 144, 5, 15, 248280) I have observed that the common kitchen often taxes the best resources of the ashram and becomes also a theatre for quarrels and heart burnings between the members.
('67', 144, 5, 16, 248445) This will be altogether avoided when the labourers alone are employed.
('67', 144, 5, 17, 248516) Labourers are used to food which they wont leave and upon which they flourish.
('67', 144, 5, 18, 248595) Educated mens tastes have become different and often artificial.
('67', 144, 5, 19, 248660) They would collapse if they attempted to live on labourers rations.
('67', 144, 5, 20, 248728) This is not to say that a common kitchen is a failure.
('67', 144, 5, 21, 248783) It is a necessity where the ideals are common and full kinship is a mutually recognized obligation.
('67', 144, 5, 22, 248883) This is not to be expected for many a year to come from the labourers.
('67', 145, 0, 1, 248954) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 146
('67', 145, 1, 2, 248996) The proposed scheme reduces chances of hypocrisy to a minimum and enables a natural union between intelligence and labour to be established.
('67', 145, 1, 3, 249137) Each will be complementary of the other.
('67', 145, 1, 4, 249178) There is, too, a chance of the ashram so conducted becoming immediately self supporting and rapidly developing.
('67', 145, 1, 5, 249290) This is all very well for the imaginary ashram or the ashrams which would experiment with the new scheme, but what about the village worker who becomes a villager for the first time in his life?
('67', 145, 1, 6, 249485) My scheme applies to him with necessary changes.
('67', 145, 1, 7, 249534) He must not regard himself as a different species from those in whose midst he is to go.
('67', 145, 1, 8, 249623) He must regard the villagers amidst whom he will work as friends and fellow workers.
('67', 145, 1, 9, 249708) According to his wants he will employ the willing labour of those whose services he may need.
('67', 145, 1, 10, 249802) And if he has enough intelligence that would suit the villagers, he may need the paid services of all the villagers who have enforced leisure and who would gladly employ it if they can.

('67', 146, 3, 4, 250396) It is good that you went and saw everybody in Nainital.
('67', 146, 3, 5, 250452) I should like you to spend the whole of June in the hills.
('67', 146, 3, 6, 250511) Postpone the programme you have drawn for 15th onward to 30th.
('67', 146, 3, 7, 250574) It is not good that the discharge from your ear has not completely stopped.
('67', 146, 3, 8, 250650) Do you keep Bombay informed?
('67', 146, 3, 9, 250679) If not, you must send a detailed report now.
('67', 146, 3, 10, 250724) We should know what they think.
('67', 146, 3, 11, 250756) If they want to express their helplessness, let them say so.
('67', 146, 3, 12, 250817) The discharge from the ear must stop.
('67', 146, 3, 13, 250855) You have perhaps been a little hasty in writing to Ogylvie, that is, from the point of view of your health.
('67', 146, 3, 14, 250963) I believe that you will see me before going to see him if he says yes.
('67', 146, 3, 15, 251034) I enclose a letter for that Danish friend.
('67', 146, 3, 16, 251077) He has given his Bombay address.

('67', 146, 3, 18, 251141) You are silent about Madalasas progress.
('67', 146, 3, 19, 251182) Kamalnayan has left.
('67', 146, 3, 20, 251203) He was quite enthusiastic.
('67', 146, 3, 21, 251230) Gangadevi has arrived and been lodged in the garden.
('67', 146, 3, 22, 251283) We met Khansaheb 2 and had long talks with him.
('67', 146, 3, 23, 251331) His health is very bad, but he was cheerful.
('67', 146, 3, 24, 251376) He was really happy that we visited him.
('67', 146, 3, 25, 251417) He remembered all of you very much.
('67', 146, 3, 26, 251453) I have written that he should be transferred to Nasik or Yeravda.
('67', 146, 3, 27, 251519) Let us see what happens.
('67', 146, 3, 28, 251544) He did feel a little worried about Abdul Ghani.
('67', 146, 3, 29, 251592) The [All India Village] Industries Association is progressing slowly yet steadily.
('67', 146, 3, 30, 251675) It is shaping up.

('67', 155, 10, 21, 263422) If it was with his sanction, then the second use is inoffensive.
('67', 155, 10, 22, 263487) But if the first use was without sanction, I do not know what answer you would give.
('67', 155, 10, 23, 263572) I had written to him.
('67', 155, 10, 24, 263594) He said he might pay later on.

('67', 156, 2, 3, 263836) June 13, 1935
('67', 156, 3, 4, 263850) BHAI VITHALDAS,
('67', 156, 4, 5, 263866) You have raised a very big issue.
('67', 156, 4, 6, 263900) If you had this doubt in your mind, the method that you adopted was wrong.
('67', 156, 4, 7, 263975) If the reason which you now give was the real reason for relieving them, they could have been relieved but in a different manner.
('67', 156, 4, 8, 264105) The question at the moment is this: Was the reason mentioned in the notice given to Ganatra 1
('67', 156, 5, 9, 264199) honestly the real one?
('67', 156, 5, 10, 264222) That notice is certainly imperfect.
('67', 156, 5, 11, 264258) If any assurance was given by Kakubhai it should certainly be honoured.
('67', 156, 5, 12, 264330) The conduct of the others was no doubt objectionable, but if they apologize for it they should be taken back.
('67', 156, 5, 13, 264440) If you approve of this much, I would take up the question of adopting a new policy and would even give immediate notice of it.
('67', 156, 5, 14, 264567) To my mind this is an important question.
('67', 156, 5, 15, 264609) Even for arriving at a correct decision about it, it is necessary to disperse this small cloud.
('67', 156, 5, 16, 264705) Unless this latter problem is solved completely, it will not be possible to solve the other important ones.

('67', 157, 5, 19, 266137) Srinagar is just a village.
('67', 157, 5, 20, 266165) You should make a beginning with yourself.

('67', 157, 8, 29, 266483) [Before June 15, 1935]
('67', 157, 9, 30, 266506) What are four years in the life of a nation, and what is even a lifetime in the vast space of eternity, when one remembered that one had to conquer the prejudices of centuries?
('67', 157, 9, 31, 266683) And have we tried enough and suffered enough?
('67', 157, 9, 32, 266729) Look at Booker T. Washington 4. Have any of
('67', 157, 10, 33, 266773) 1 Viyogi Hari 2 Lakshmi Marutidas Sharma 3 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 157, 10, 34, 266869) The Harijan sevak had failed to get enought money for his institutions from the Harijan Sevak Sangh and was also unable to enlist the sympathies of young men during the four years of his service.
('67', 157, 10, 35, 267065) 4 American Negro educator, founder of the Tuskegee Institute.
('67', 157, 10, 36, 267127) He had to suffer great hardships as a youth.
('67', 158, 0, 1, 267172) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 159
('67', 158, 1, 2, 267219) us suffered as much as he did?
('67', 158, 1, 3, 267250) We narrate the woes of Harijans but do we ever share with them those woes?
('67', 158, 1, 4, 267325) They are sharp witted enough to see that we do not starve whilst it is they who have to starve, we have plenty of clean water to drink whereas they have dirty pools to depend upon.
('67', 158, 1, 5, 267506) The Harijan Sevak Sangh does not give you money.
('67', 158, 1, 6, 267555) Well, it is right from its point of view.
('67', 158, 1, 7, 267597) We have begun at the wrong end; we rely on outside assistance instead of relying on our own strength.
('67', 158, 1, 8, 267699) The time has come when we must cease to be spoonfed.
('67', 158, 1, 9, 267752) Why not teach the boys in the verandahs or their own sheds and make the school a natural growth from the soil?
('67', 158, 1, 10, 267863) Why not get them help you in growing your own grain and your vegetables and thus reduce the expenses of the boarding house?
('67', 158, 1, 11, 267987) It is preposterous for a school, say in Trivandrum, to depend on Delhi.
('67', 158, 1, 12, 268059) It is so unnatural.
('67', 158, 1, 13, 268079) It may have been necessary in the initial stages, but it should be no longer necessary now.
('67', 158, 1, 14, 268171) The man in charge of the school depending for his salary on Delhi is a foreigner there.
('67', 158, 1, 15, 268259) If he completely identifies himself with Harijans, they will share with him their meagre fare and will certainly not allow him to starve.
('67', 158, 1, 16, 268397) It is no use looking up to the Central Board every now and then.
('67', 158, 1, 17, 268462) The Central Board will keep the whole show nicely moving, but the sinews should come from the offshoots, the provincial boards.
('67', 158, 1, 18, 268590) But my mind is daily making so many discoveries that I feel that we might even dispense with collections.
('67', 158, 1, 19, 268696) If we have no money we have other resources, if only we knew the art of discovering them.
('67', 158, 1, 20, 268786) And why should the Harijans be the cause of despair?
('67', 158, 1, 21, 268839) Show me many people who can keep their pledges.
('67', 158, 1, 22, 268887) Have we kept all our pledges?
('67', 158, 1, 23, 268917) And why do we make so much of their carrion eating?
('67', 158, 1, 24, 268969) We want them to give it up no doubt, but it is no use getting impatient with them.
('67', 158, 1, 25, 269052) If many savarna Hindus eat flesh, naturally they will eat carrion.
('67', 158, 1, 26, 269119) There is hardly any chemical difference between meat and carrion.
('67', 158, 1, 27, 269185) You will remember Dr. Deshmukh wrote to me that he would find it impossible to distinguish between fresh meat and fresh carrion.
('67', 158, 1, 28, 269314) And the logic at least is with the Harijans.
('67', 158, 1, 29, 269359) A rich Hindu may afford to have a goat killed for himself, but what is a poor Harijan to do?
('67', 158, 1, 30, 269452) You will give him no live goat, and you will not allow him to eat a dead goats flesh that chance throws in his way.
('67', 158, 1, 31, 269568) No, We must realize that there is no vice among the Harijans that is not traceable to us.
('67', 158, 1, 32, 269658) It is we who have to do all the penance.
('67', 158, 1, 33, 269699) If crores of savarna Hindus will give up meat eating, Harijans will today give up carrion.
('67', 159, 0, 1, 269790) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 160
('67', 159, 1, 2, 269832) QUESTION: Could we ask them to leave their wretched abodes and settle in our midst?
('67', 159, 2, 3, 269916) ANSWER: This is more easily said than done.
('67', 159, 2, 4, 269960) If all caste Hindus become reformers your question wont arise.
('67', 159, 2, 5, 270023) Today the reformers would be powerless to defend Harijans from molestation if they settled in savarna quarters.
('67', 159, 2, 6, 270135) But I would advocate exodus by Harijans from where they are persistently persecuted, as by the Nattars for example.
('67', 159, 3, 7, 270251) Q. What about making them go through an Upanayana 1 ceremony?
('67', 159, 4, 8, 270313) A. No; it involves the assumption that they are low and that they have got to be raised to a higher status.
('67', 159, 4, 9, 270421) There is nothing low about them.
('67', 159, 4, 10, 270454) Whatever appears to be low in them is a reflection of our own terrible lowness.
('67', 159, 4, 11, 270534) Supposing I have a diseased child, what shall I do with it?
('67', 159, 4, 12, 270594) Shall I discard it, shall I consider it low?
('67', 159, 4, 13, 270639) No, I shall have to remind myself that it is suffering for my sins, and that therefore it deserves extra care from me.
('67', 159, 4, 14, 270758) But here with the Harijans, let me tell you that I literally hold that they are far superior to us.
('67', 159, 4, 15, 270858) They have remained with us in spite of our persecution, and they are still clinging on to us.
('67', 159, 4, 16, 270952) It is a marvel of marvels to me that they continue to hold on to a religion, of which some of the adherents say that it has no place for them.
('67', 159, 4, 17, 271095) No, we must come down from the high pedestal we have occupied all these years and take our natural place with them.

('67', 159, 7, 20, 271258) The few lines that I wrote 2 inviting the people to prayer and repentance on the Quetta disaster have given rise to some private correspondence.
('67', 159, 7, 21, 271403) One of the correspondents asks:
('67', 159, 8, 22, 271435) At the time of the Bihar quake you had no hesitation in saying that it was to be taken by savarna Hindus as a fit punishment for the sin of untouchability.
('67', 159, 8, 23, 271591) For what sin must the more terrible quake of Quetta be?
('67', 159, 8, 24, 271647) The writer had the right to put the question.
('67', 159, 8, 25, 271693) What I said about Bihar was deliberately said even as the lines on Quetta were deliberately written.
('67', 159, 8, 26, 271794) This call to prayer is a definite yearning of the soul.
('67', 159, 8, 27, 271850) Prayer is a sign of repentance, a desire to beocme better, purer.
('67', 159, 8, 28, 271916) A man of prayer regards what are known as physical calamities as divine chastisement.
('67', 159, 8, 29, 272002) It is a chastisement alike for individuals and for

('67', 160, 1, 2, 272158) natioins.
('67', 160, 1, 3, 272168) All chastisements do not equally startle people.
('67', 160, 1, 4, 272217) Some affect only individuals, some others affect groups or nations only mildly.
('67', 160, 1, 5, 272297) Disasters like Quetta stun us.
('67', 160, 1, 6, 272328) Familiarity with ordinary everyday calamities breeds contempt for them.
('67', 160, 1, 7, 272400) If earthquakes were a daily occurrence, we would take no notice of them.
('67', 160, 1, 8, 272473) Even this Quetta one has not caused in us the same disturbance that the Bihar one did.
('67', 160, 1, 9, 272560) But it is the universal experience that every calamity brings a sensible man down on his knees.
('67', 160, 1, 10, 272656) He thinks that it is Gods answer to his sins and that he must henceforth behave better.
('67', 160, 1, 11, 272744) His sins have left him hopelessly weak, and in his weakness he cries out to God for help.
('67', 160, 1, 12, 272834) Thus have millions of human beings used their personal calamities for self improvement.
('67', 160, 1, 13, 272922) Nations too have been known to invoke the assistance of God when calamities have overtaken them.
('67', 160, 1, 14, 273019) They have abased themselves before God and appointed days of humiliation, prayer and purification.
('67', 160, 1, 15, 273118) I have suggested nothing new or original.
('67', 160, 1, 16, 273160) In these days of fashionable disbelief, it does need some courage to call men and women to repentance.
('67', 160, 1, 17, 273263) But I can claim no credit for courage.
('67', 160, 1, 18, 273302) For my weaknesses or idiosyncrasies are well known.
('67', 160, 1, 19, 273354) If I had known Quetta, as I know Bihar and Biharis, I would certainly have mentioned the sins of Quetta, though they might be no more its specialities than untouchability was Bihars.
('67', 160, 1, 20, 273537) But we allthe rulers and the ruled know that we have many sins, personal and national, to answer for.
('67', 160, 1, 21, 273639) The call is to all these to repentance, prayer and humiliation.
('67', 160, 1, 22, 273703) True prayer is not a prelude to inaction.
('67', 160, 1, 23, 273745) It is a spur to ceaselesss, selfless action.
('67', 160, 1, 24, 273790) Purification is never for the selfishly idle, it accrues only to the selflessly industrious.

('67', 161, 6, 10, 274322) A friend has been persistently asking me to draw public attention to the species of gambling prevalent in Bombay among the so called high class people.
('67', 161, 6, 11, 274474) Whilst I have been heart and soul with the friend in deploring the evil, I have not had the courage to write about it.
('67', 161, 6, 12, 274593) I felt that whatever I said would be a waste of effort, as I had no hope of following up my writing by some organized constructive effort to combat the evil.
('67', 161, 6, 13, 274751) Whilst I was thus debating as to writing on the evil, I had to go to Borsad in answer to the Sardars summons.
('67', 161, 6, 14, 274861) There in Borsad the Sardar and his volunteers poured into my ears harrowing tales of the havoc that gambling was working in the villages of Gujarat.
('67', 161, 6, 15, 275010) It is spreading like grass fire of a windy night.
('67', 161, 6, 16, 275060) Everybody is in a hurry to be rich without working.
('67', 161, 6, 17, 275112) Somebody will have made the correct guess as to the ruling price for the day of some commodity.
('67', 161, 6, 18, 275208) Why not I?argues the gambler and rushes to his ruin.
('67', 161, 6, 19, 275261) Peace is being destroyed in the once happy homes of Gujarat.
('67', 161, 6, 20, 275322) There is no doubt that whatever one calls it, this gambling is as old as Adam, and that though the form and the name may have changed, the substance has not changed at all.
('67', 161, 6, 21, 275495) The law must be against this gambling.
('67', 161, 6, 22, 275534) But it is of no avail if public opinion is not behind it.
('67', 161, 6, 23, 275592) It is therefore necessary for workers to

('67', 161, 7, 25, 275670) The correspondent had drawn attention to the primitive process of oil pressing which resulted in much wastage.
('67', 161, 7, 26, 275781) He had mentioned that villagers did not even make use of the cake and those who used unginned cotton on the adhi system threw away the cotton seeds.
('67', 161, 7, 27, 275930) He had suggested to A.I.S.A. workers there to set up a ghani to be made available to the villagers at no cost or for a part of the cake.

('67', 162, 1, 3, 276210) They must not be satisfied till the evil is rooted out.
('67', 162, 1, 4, 276266) In a way it is worse than the plague or the quake.
('67', 162, 1, 5, 276317) For it destroys the soul within.
('67', 162, 1, 6, 276350) A person without the soul is a burden upon the earth.
('67', 162, 1, 7, 276404) No doubt war against gambling is not so simple as war against plague or earthquake distress.
('67', 162, 1, 8, 276497) In the latter there is more or less co operation from the sufferers.
('67', 162, 1, 9, 276566) In the former the sufferers invite and hug their sufferings.
('67', 162, 1, 10, 276627) To wean the gambler from his vice is like weaning the drunkard from the drink habit.
('67', 162, 1, 11, 276712) This war against gambling is therefore an uphill task.
('67', 162, 1, 12, 276767) But it must be tackled, if the evil is not dealt with in time.
('67', 162, 1, 13, 276830) It is bad enough in Bombay.
('67', 162, 1, 14, 276858) Its inroad upon the villages is a danger signal which no lover of the country can dare ignore.

('67', 162, 6, 19, 277032) I have your letter.
('67', 162, 6, 20, 277052) I hope that Kichi 1 is out of fever.
('67', 162, 6, 21, 277089) What is the matter with him?
('67', 162, 6, 22, 277118) When you are not there, with whom does he stay?
('67', 162, 6, 23, 277166) How does he pass his time?
('67', 162, 6, 24, 277193) Does he interest himself in any thing or person?
('67', 162, 6, 25, 277242) Kamala has written to me.
('67', 162, 6, 26, 277268) How nice it would be if you could come with her.
('67', 162, 6, 27, 277317) 2 But I know you must not leave Father or Kichi just now.
('67', 162, 6, 28, 277375) Yes the Quetta disaster is awful.
('67', 162, 6, 29, 277409) You should ponder over what I have written thereon.
('67', 162, 6, 30, 277461) Prabha is with her father.
('67', 162, 6, 31, 277488) She returns in July.

('67', 163, 3, 4, 277718) BHAISHRI VALLABHBHAI,
('67', 163, 4, 5, 277740) On the subject coming up for discussion with Balvantrai 1, I told him that it was on your advice that Devchandbhai 2 was not calling a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Kathiawar Political Conference, and that I, too, approved of the decision.
('67', 163, 4, 6, 277992) Balvantrai says that nobody desires to transgress the limits agreed upon in Porbandar.
('67', 163, 4, 7, 278079) I have told him that if he could assure you to that effect, you might perhaps withdraw your objection.
('67', 163, 4, 8, 278182) But even apart from this, I have advised him to talk things over with you.
('67', 163, 4, 9, 278257) He and some others are here in connection with the situation in Sikar.
('67', 163, 4, 10, 278328) 3 He will tell you my opinion about it.
('67', 163, 4, 11, 278368) Get well soon.

('67', 164, 6, 10, 279597) MY DEAR MOHANLAL 1
('67', 164, 7, 11, 279616) I have your letter.
('67', 164, 7, 12, 279636) The point you raised cannot be discussed in the pages of the Harijan.
('67', 164, 7, 13, 279706) I think that Dr. Gopichands opinion is quite sound.
('67', 164, 7, 14, 279758) Only I would go a step further and say that as Sangh we ought not to carry on any agitation regarding what may be done by the Government.
('67', 164, 7, 15, 279896) Our scope is confined to such work as we can do without the assistance of the Government.
('67', 164, 7, 16, 279986) We should appreciate every step that the Government may take.
('67', 164, 7, 17, 280048) It is open to us to give co operation to the Government if and when they seek it.
('67', 164, 7, 18, 280130) But it is outside our province to criticize the Government or to carry on platform agitation with a view to secure measures from the Government.
('67', 164, 7, 19, 280275) This is not conceived as a permanent policy but for the moment I have not doubt that it is the only sound policy for us to follow.
('67', 164, 7, 20, 280406) We must recognize that Harijans at the present moment are undecided as to what they should do.
('67', 164, 7, 21, 280501) We must deserve their absolute confidence before we can hope to influence the Government along the lines that we may desire.
('67', 164, 7, 22, 280626) I take it that you will show this letter to Dr. Gopichand also.

('67', 165, 3, 5, 281000) I cannot read Urdu fast and I have little leisure left to me today for reading however much I may like to do it.
('67', 165, 3, 6, 281113) At the present moment I have given your book to a Mussalman friend who is staying with us.
('67', 165, 3, 7, 281204) When he has finished it I shall try to go through your book and if and when I succeed I shall certainly give you my opinion.
('67', 165, 3, 8, 281329) You may not know that I do not review any book in the pages of the Harijan.

('67', 165, 8, 14, 281617) I have gone through your book on tanning.
('67', 165, 8, 15, 281659) It is very scrappy and very incomplete.
('67', 165, 8, 16, 281699) There are many things omitted.
('67', 165, 8, 17, 281730) It is not a book which a learner may take up and carry on experiments without reference to any teacher.
('67', 165, 8, 18, 281834) You have not given the accurate proportion of materials used.
('67', 165, 8, 19, 281896) I would recommend your rewriting the chapters and making your book much more accurate than it is.
('67', 165, 8, 20, 281994) It need not be bulky but it ought to be accurate.
('67', 165, 8, 21, 282044) You have said very little about the quality of water to be used by tanners and all the literature I have read about tanning lays the greatest stress upon the quality of water.
('67', 165, 8, 22, 282220) Lastly it seems to me that the price you have put upon the book is altogether out of proportion to the cost of the publication.
('67', 165, 8, 23, 282348) Your book is not intended for the wealthy few but it is intended for the poor many.

('67', 166, 4, 6, 282643) I thought that I had returned the book you left with me long ago.
('67', 166, 4, 7, 282709) That was to have been handed to you when you passed through on your way to Poona.
('67', 166, 4, 8, 282791) Somehow or other this was not done.
('67', 166, 4, 9, 282827) I hope you have now received it.
('67', 166, 4, 10, 282860) It was sent immediately after I got the letter.
('67', 166, 4, 11, 282908) As for the apparatus I gave it for trial to Shri Kishorelal Mashruwala whom I introduced to you and who is an asthmatic.
('67', 166, 4, 12, 283029) He has been giving it a trial and I have asked him to make a written report.
('67', 166, 4, 13, 283106) As soon as I receive it I shall send it to you.
('67', 166, 4, 14, 283154) So far as my own opinion is concerned I think that it is a very simple device for measuring the breathing capacity of people and therefore it is likely to be of use in schools and hospitals where the lung capacity of children or patients is required to be measured.

('67', 166, 11, 25, 283684) As I have already said I would like to buy one machine from you so as to enable me to try it for a lengthened period.
('67', 166, 11, 26, 283802) If it gives the work that I contemplate it may be possible to take from you a large number at an agreed price.
('67', 166, 11, 27, 283913) And I would like to discuss more fully the larger proposition I tentatively discussed with you for enforcement in the event of your failing to secure the price.

('67', 167, 6, 11, 284648) SHARMA, I have your letter.
('67', 167, 6, 12, 284676) A time limit of 15 days is too short.
('67', 167, 6, 13, 284714) Even important persons do not get passport in 15 days.
('67', 167, 6, 14, 284769) Recently a doctor got a passport after 18 months.
('67', 167, 6, 15, 284819) Your coming here is a different matter.

('67', 167, 6, 20, 285042) We shall think of a separate room only after your arrival.
('67', 167, 6, 21, 285101) All this will be done only after the decision about the passport.
('67', 167, 6, 22, 285167) And after getting the passport, will a separate room be necessary?
('67', 167, 6, 23, 285234) Before coming here, you will have to write to the Collector or see him and tell him that he should write to Wardha, in case he wants to make any inquiries.
('67', 167, 6, 24, 285390) He should also be asked when the reply may be expected.
('67', 167, 6, 25, 285446) I have not understood what you have written about Mother.
('67', 167, 6, 26, 285504) Ramgopal has sent many complaints but they are not well founded.

('67', 170, 6, 13, 288769) DEAR MALKANI,
('67', 170, 7, 14, 288783) The letter dictated on Sunday has not yet been posted.
('67', 170, 7, 15, 288838) This, therefore, will accompany that letter.
('67', 170, 7, 16, 288883) I cannot trace anywhere the letter written to you by Mrs. Nehru which you were sending me and which you wanted me to return.
('67', 170, 7, 17, 289008) You will, therefore, trace that letter in your papers.
('67', 170, 7, 18, 289063) I shall not need it because I shall guess its purport and I hope to deal with Womens Conference in one of the issues of the Harijan.
('67', 170, 7, 19, 289196) As you will see from the forthcoming issue I shall be dealing with the Wells Fund practically from week to week.
('67', 170, 7, 20, 289309) I have already dealt with the Punjab report.
('67', 170, 7, 21, 289354) I have on my file the Bihar report and now I understand also the Gujarat report.
('67', 170, 7, 22, 289435) The one or the other will go in next week.
('67', 170, 7, 23, 289478) I have already written to Seth Jugalkishore.
('67', 170, 7, 24, 289523) I have told him that he should not mind the mention, and that it was begun by Thakkar Bapa purely out of enthusiastic admiration.
('67', 170, 7, 25, 289653) I have also said that if he has still strong objection to his name being in any way coupled with the Fund, it will be formally removed.
('67', 170, 7, 26, 289789) If you have, therefore, already not written to him, you need not think about it any more until I write to you.
('67', 170, 7, 27, 289900) What is your objection to the David Scholarship Fund retaining the name David?

('67', 171, 5, 8, 290314) MY DEAR JAGANNATHDAS, You were quite right in writing to me at length on nudism.
('67', 171, 5, 9, 290395) 1 I have no hesitation in agreeing with you in theory.
('67', 171, 5, 10, 290450) But theories are not always capable of being reduced to practice.
('67', 171, 5, 11, 290516) Not even in exact mathematics, like geometry, are theories capable of always being reduced to practice.
('67', 171, 5, 12, 290620) The imaginary right angle of geometry will not build houses but the nearly perfect right angle which masons and carpenters use is responsible for many marvellous things.
('67', 171, 5, 13, 290790) In the Western world as well as in India nudism in practice is not permissible.
('67', 171, 5, 14, 290870) I am convinced that it would be a great error to act as though all men and women were pure minded.
('67', 171, 5, 15, 290969) I hold it, therefore, to be dangerous.

('67', 171, 10, 21, 291167) DEAR CAVEESHAR, Dr. Khan Saheb should reamin the solitary exception.
('67', 171, 10, 22, 291236) By all means take what assistance you can from Dr. Gopichand without connecting him officially with any organization.
('67', 171, 10, 23, 291354) I assure you that one or the other is bound to suffer if he is officially connected with both.

('67', 171, 11, 26, 291609) Clothing, he had argued, was unnatural and unhealthy and ought to be abolished, thus ensuring the exposure of the skin to light and air.

('67', 172, 1, 3, 291941) I know we are grievously short of true workers and we shall always remain so if we continue to saddle more than one responsibility on them and flatter ourselves with the belief that they are being well discharged.
('67', 172, 1, 4, 292155) If you agree with my argument you will be satisfied with Dr. Gopichand giving you the help required without being officially identified with the Parliamentary Board.
('67', 172, 1, 5, 292321) Absence of official connection gives a freedom to a conscientious man which he will not enjoy when he is officially connected.

('67', 172, 9, 22, 293109) June 18, 1935
('67', 172, 10, 23, 293123) With the consent of both the parties concerned, I have been involved in the grievances of the workers of the Bombay bhandar of the All India Spinners Association against their local agent.
('67', 172, 10, 24, 293312) I have gone through the papers presented by both parties.
('67', 172, 11, 25, 293370) 1 Vide also the following two items.
('67', 173, 0, 1, 293407) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 174
('67', 173, 1, 2, 293449) The notice served on Mr. Ganatra was improper.
('67', 173, 1, 3, 293496) This defect can be overcome by giving him additional salary.
('67', 173, 1, 4, 293557) The conduct of the workers and their written memoranda after the notice had been served were rude and not befitting those who serve the cause of khadi.
('67', 173, 1, 5, 293709) Such conduct cannot keep any institution going.
('67', 173, 1, 6, 293757) Hence, the agent is justified in dismissing the workers who misbehaved.
('67', 173, 1, 7, 293829) However, if the workers give a written apology as suggested in the appendix, the agent should reinstate everyone including Shri Ganatra without any deductions from their salaries.
('67', 173, 1, 8, 294009) If the workers do not hand in the letter of apology within seventy two hours of this resolution reaching Shri Ratubhai Desai,the representative of the workers, they would not be able to join their duty and the notice they have been served with will hold good permanently.
('67', 173, 1, 9, 294281) The agent is of the opinion that the bhandar does not have the capacity to bear the burden of the number of workers employed there.
('67', 173, 1, 10, 294413) The award I have given above does not preclude any changes in the bhandar, reduction in the number of workers engaged or in their present salaries.
('67', 173, 1, 11, 294561) I myself wish to make some suggestions regarding the way in which all khadi bhandars are being run, and it has become necessary to state them now.
('67', 173, 1, 12, 294708) It is my hope that the workers will willingly sign the letter of apology and return to their duty in the bhandar.
('67', 173, 1, 13, 294822) In case all the dismissed workers do not accept the above decision, the agent shall take back those who do so.

('67', 173, 3, 15, 294946) APPENDIX
('67', 173, 4, 16, 294955) After Shri Ganatra received the notice of dismissal, his and our behaviour was not worthy of the khadi workers.
('67', 173, 4, 17, 295067) The letters we wrote were rude.
('67', 173, 4, 18, 295099) We are sorry for such conduct.
('67', 173, 4, 19, 295130) Hereafter we shall ceaselessly endeavour not to behave in that manner.

('67', 174, 4, 9, 295535) I will soon take up the question of the policy as a whole.
('67', 174, 4, 10, 295594) Arrange and note down your ideas about the subject.

('67', 174, 10, 21, 296096) The purport of the message is that if you, Ganatra and others do not send in your apologies, you are doomed.
('67', 174, 10, 22, 296205) I have given the message in the hope that all of you will live as members of a family and will work with greater devotion than before and serve the cause of khadi through the bhandar.
('67', 174, 10, 23, 296389) Write to me as soon as possible what you have to say regarding the management of the bhandar.
('67', 174, 10, 24, 296483) I shall take up the matter immediately.
('67', 174, 10, 25, 296523) The bhandar does not belong to anybody.
('67', 174, 10, 26, 296563) It is for us only a means of service.

('67', 176, 5, 23, 299240) You will tell me how you find them.
('67', 176, 5, 24, 299276) You should have the spindles locally made.

('67', 176, 5, 27, 299432) A weak spindle spins as well as any other, so long as it remains true.
('67', 176, 5, 28, 299503) But in an inexperienced hand a weak spindle will go wrong more frequently than a steel spindle.
('67', 176, 5, 29, 299599) I am sending you also 450 note paper sheets and an equal number of envelopes done up in nine bundles.
('67', 176, 5, 30, 299701) I was about to have packets of 50 each pressed and nicely covered in some blank paper, of course hand made, when your letter came telling me that I was to send the sheets coverless and that you would have them dressed up for the windows.
('67', 176, 5, 31, 299939) You ask me to give you the price.
('67', 176, 5, 32, 299973) The bundle that is coming to you with Charlie and the one that was sent previously to this were made out of paper which has cost me Rs. 12. Odd sheets that
('67', 177, 0, 1, 300129) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 178
('67', 177, 1, 2, 300171) were saved were used up by me.
('67', 177, 1, 3, 300202) There still remain 150 sheets with me.
('67', 177, 1, 4, 300241) The labour of making these I have not counted, nor the price of material specially prepared for making the envelopes.
('67', 177, 1, 5, 300359) The price of the latter can only be trifling.
('67', 177, 1, 6, 300405) The price of the former cannot today be estimated.
('67', 177, 1, 7, 300456) Two or three workers have been at it for some odd days.
('67', 177, 1, 8, 300512) I did not ask them to keep a record of all the time that they gave to this work.
('67', 177, 1, 9, 300593) Now I have given you enough material to put your own price on the note papers and envelopes.
('67', 177, 1, 10, 300686) The least you have to sell them for is Rs. 12. But you are at liberty to do what you like with them.
('67', 177, 1, 11, 300787) Of the slivers I can say nothing because all I have to pay for is the cotton purchased from the khaddar bhandar.
('67', 177, 1, 12, 300900) But I have kept no account of what has been sent to you.
('67', 177, 1, 13, 300957) The raw material could not have cost more than a rupee and a half.
('67', 177, 1, 14, 301024) As to Quetta relief I have asked you to reserve for the time being what you collect.
('67', 177, 1, 15, 301109) Later on I shall be able to guide you.
('67', 177, 1, 16, 301148) The relief will last for some time.
('67', 177, 1, 17, 301184) Of course this advice has force so long as you have no definite idea about its direction.
('67', 177, 1, 18, 301274) Immediately you know where you would like to spend your donation, you will not hesitate to do so.
('67', 177, 1, 19, 301372) One thing I cannot help asking you to collect for and that is the Harijan Wells Fund.
('67', 177, 1, 20, 301458) You will note what I have said 1 about it in the ensuing number of the Harijan.
('67', 177, 1, 21, 301538) About the photos you will do what you like with them.
('67', 177, 1, 22, 301592) They are your property.
('67', 177, 1, 23, 301616) I think this covers all the points raised in your two unanswered letters.
('67', 177, 1, 24, 301690) There is nothing wrong about the right hand.
('67', 177, 1, 25, 301735) It will be all right after due rest.
('67', 177, 1, 26, 301772) Love to you both.

('67', 177, 3, 30, 301890) DEAR SISTER, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the quotation.
('67', 177, 3, 31, 301953) But my difficulty is fundamental.
('67', 177, 3, 32, 301987) Which Jesus am I to believe?
('67', 177, 3, 33, 302016) Him of your conception or mine?
('67', 177, 3, 34, 302048) You will say, Jesus of the Bible.
('67', 177, 3, 35, 302082) Then the question is: According to whose interpretation? I solve the difficulty by going the way God takes me.

('67', 178, 6, 14, 302876) I will do as you wish.
('67', 178, 6, 15, 302899) I was surprised to learn about what you had to go through in the hospital.
('67', 178, 6, 16, 302974) Write out in English all that you observed and show the draft to Deenabandhu Andrews.
('67', 178, 6, 17, 303060) Then send it to the head of the institution.
('67', 178, 6, 18, 303105) If he does not pay attention to it, we shall take the next step.
('67', 178, 6, 19, 303170) Inquire as to who controls the hospital and who are the persons in charge of its running and let me know their names and addresses.
('67', 178, 6, 20, 303302) You put up with the hardships but what would a poor man do?
('67', 178, 6, 21, 303362) You have a devoted wife like Sita and, therefore, receive the best nursing.
('67', 178, 6, 22, 303438) But what would be the plight of a person who has nobody to look after him and who has no faith in God?
('67', 178, 6, 23, 303541) You must, therefore, acquaint the proper quarters with what you went through in the hospital.
('67', 178, 6, 24, 303635) I hope your health is daily improving.

('67', 179, 3, 5, 303983) The expenses seem all right.

('67', 179, 3, 8, 304185) Even if Vanamalas fever has subsided, it will benefit her if she sticks to the diet I have suggested.

('67', 180, 2, 3, 305397) June 21, 1935
('67', 180, 3, 4, 305411) PREMA, I was not in a position to reply immediately to your excellent letter.
('67', 180, 3, 5, 305489) When the right hand demands rest, it becomes impossible to cope with the work.
('67', 180, 3, 6, 305568) All my questions are not such as can be asked in a letter.
('67', 180, 3, 7, 305627) I must of course have asked you such questions.
('67', 180, 3, 8, 305675) Questions which occur to me at any moment belong only to that moment.
('67', 180, 3, 9, 305745) My aim in taking you to Borsad was that you might be able to do such work more easily in future, and to show you that I had taken a share in anti plague work also.
('67', 180, 3, 10, 305909) I have already written in Harijan and explained the connection between our sin and the earthquake.
('67', 180, 3, 11, 306008) 1 Read that article.
('67', 180, 3, 12, 306029) Nobody was angered in Bihar.
('67', 180, 3, 13, 306058) On the contrary, everybody realized that it was the result of our sin.
('67', 180, 3, 14, 306129) All this follows from the principle of oneness.
('67', 180, 3, 15, 306177) I have written an article 2 in Harijan about snakes, etc.
('67', 180, 3, 16, 306235) Read it.
('67', 180, 3, 17, 306244) If you are not reading the articles which I have been writing recently in Harijan, I would advise you to read them carefully.
('67', 180, 3, 18, 306370) I hope you get copies of it.
('67', 180, 3, 19, 306399) I wouldnt see any sin in ending the life of the husband who was lingering in pain and to whom no relief could be given even by careful nursing.
('67', 180, 3, 20, 306543) 3 If, however, the husband is conscious, his wishes should be ascertained.
('67', 180, 3, 21, 306618) If he wishes to live despite the pain, he should be allowed to live.
('67', 180, 3, 22, 306687) The owners becoming trustees means their handing over to the poor, that is, to the State or any other public welfare institution, all income in excess of a certain percentage.
('67', 180, 3, 23, 306863) If everybody handed over all their possessions to the State, the spirit of enterprise would disappear and everybody would become an automaton My relations with the rich will continue.
('67', 180, 3, 24, 307047) I dont look upon the rich as wicked and upon the poor as angels.
('67', 180, 3, 25, 307112) Both in the East and the West there are a great many rich who earn money with philanthropic motives.
('67', 180, 3, 26, 307213) They deserve to be honoured.
('67', 180, 3, 27, 307242) I know numbers of poor

('67', 181, 1, 4, 307683) What will it matter if this remains for ever a dream?
('67', 181, 1, 5, 307737) If I didnt know what I wanted, what would I strive for?
('67', 181, 1, 6, 307793) It is certainly true that I cannot understand people correctly, but do those who claim to understand them really do so?
('67', 181, 1, 7, 307913) I, therefore, do not regret my ignorance.
('67', 181, 1, 8, 307955) Since I cannot know human beings, I trust them.
('67', 181, 1, 9, 308003) Is it necessary for you to answer every time somebody asks you a question about me?
('67', 181, 1, 10, 308087) Why dont you say, I cannot answer your question.
('67', 181, 1, 11, 308136) I like the mans work and his ideas.
('67', 181, 1, 12, 308172) Does one always give reasons for what one likes?
('67', 181, 1, 13, 308221) You should, therefore, address your questions to the man himself?
('67', 181, 1, 14, 308287) If you replied thus, you would be saved from a great deal of unpleasant argument.
('67', 181, 1, 15, 308369) However, you may certainly impart to others what you have learnt from me and fully digested.
('67', 181, 1, 16, 308462) But then what one has digested doesnt remain somebody elses but becomes ones own.
('67', 181, 1, 17, 308544) One entertains no doubt about what is ones own and is always ready with answers to any questions about it.

('67', 181, 4, 23, 308922) Their remedies are like black magic.
('67', 181, 4, 24, 308959) They are just a shot in the dark.
('67', 181, 4, 25, 308993) Are they worth trying even if they help?
('67', 181, 4, 26, 309034) The best known vaid in the country is Gananath Sen.
('67', 181, 4, 27, 309086) But he also is like the others.
('67', 181, 4, 28, 309118) They do have some effective drugs, but when their power is exhausted you are where you were.
('67', 181, 4, 29, 309211) I would quake with fear to put you in their hands.
('67', 181, 4, 30, 309262) I see that even Malaviyaji and Motilalji went ultimately to doctors.

('67', 182, 3, 4, 309646) KRISHNACHANDRA,
('67', 182, 4, 5, 309662) Maybe in the early morning you may feel listless, but after sipping something, the strength will return and you may then stir out for a walk.
('67', 182, 4, 6, 309804) The stomach should be empty before sleep.
('67', 182, 4, 7, 309846) Repetition of Ramanama serves me best when I am engaged in an act of service.
('67', 182, 4, 8, 309924) But if one does not get peace in this way, one may seek it in solitude.
('67', 182, 4, 9, 309996) True renown comes from service rendered while practising truthfulness and other virtues.
('67', 182, 4, 10, 310085) God is author of good and evil, after all, only to the devotee.
('67', 182, 4, 11, 310149) A proud ungodly man believes that he does everything.
('67', 182, 4, 12, 310203) The Gita would not have been necessary if the Arjuna within had conducted rigorously the battle that goes on in this body.

('67', 182, 8, 16, 310432) [Before June 22, 1935]
('67', 182, 9, 17, 310455) VISITOR: But why prayer, and not service?
('67', 182, 9, 18, 310497) Would not service be the most effective form of prayer?
('67', 182, 10, 19, 310553) GANDHIJI: Indeed if service was open to us.
('67', 182, 10, 20, 310597) But there are vast masses of people who have no power to render any tangible service to the survivors.
('67', 182, 10, 21, 310700) Rather than talk about this grim visitation, they should cast the searchlight inwards and purify themselves.
('67', 182, 10, 22, 310809) Prayer is a call to self purification.
('67', 182, 11, 23, 310848) But is not prayer by itself ineffective without acts of service?
('67', 182, 11, 24, 310913) I do not mean outward demonstration of prayer.
('67', 182, 11, 25, 310960) I mean self introspection and self purification which is essential for us all.
('67', 182, 12, 26, 311039) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had reported that the visitor had specially come to give Gandhiji an idea of the ravages of the earthquake .

('67', 183, 1, 4, 311411) And when we are not so engaged, Gods name, taken with a view to self purification, is not taken in vain.
('67', 183, 1, 5, 311516) I see it.
('67', 183, 1, 6, 311526) So far as some of the survivorsboth our own people and tommies who did rescue work for the first two daysare concerned, I am afraid they badly need to pray.
('67', 183, 1, 7, 311683) For the moment when the calamity occurs we are stunned, we make professions of prayer and brotherhood of man, but the very next moment we forget that there was a calamity.
('67', 183, 1, 8, 311855) Our acquisitive and depredatory instincts get possession of us, with the result, we are none the better for the earthquake.

('67', 183, 4, 11, 312018) [Before June 22, 1935]
('67', 183, 5, 12, 312041) GANDHIJI: Is not this wheel a machine?
('67', 183, 6, 13, 312080) [SOCIALIST:] I do not mean this machine, but I mean bigger machinery.
('67', 183, 6, 14, 312150) Do you mean Singers sewing machine?
('67', 183, 6, 15, 312186) That too is protected by the village industries movement, and for that matter any machinery which does not deprive masses of men of the opportunity to labour, but which helps the individual and adds to his efficiency, and which a man can handle at will without being its slave.
('67', 183, 7, 16, 312464) But what about the great inventions?
('67', 183, 7, 17, 312501) You would have nothing to do with electricity?
('67', 183, 7, 18, 312548) Who said so?
('67', 183, 7, 19, 312561) If we could have electricity in every village home, I should not mind villagers plying their implements and tools with the help of electricity.
('67', 183, 7, 20, 312705) But then the village communities or the State would own power houses, just as they have their grazing pastures.
('67', 183, 7, 21, 312817) But where there is no electricity and no machinery, what are idle hands to do?
('67', 183, 7, 22, 312896) Will you give them work, or would you have their owners cut them down for want of work?
('67', 183, 7, 23, 312984) I would prize every invention of science made for the benefit of all.
('67', 183, 7, 24, 313054) There is a difference between invention and invention.
('67', 183, 7, 25, 313109) I should not care for the asphyxiating gases capable of killing masses of men
('67', 183, 8, 26, 313187) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had reported: A socialist holding a brief for machinery asked Gandhiji if the village industries movement was not meant to oust all machinery. 2 Gandhiji was just then spinning.

('67', 184, 1, 2, 313473) at a time.
('67', 184, 1, 3, 313484) The heavy machinery for work of public utility which cannot be undertaken by human labour has its inevitable place, but all that would be owned by the State and used entirely for the benefit of the people.
('67', 184, 1, 4, 313690) I can have no consideration for machinery which is meant either to enrich the few at the expense of the many, or without cause to displace the useful labour of many.
('67', 184, 1, 5, 313856) But even you as a socialist would not be in favour of an indiscriminate use of machinery.
('67', 184, 1, 6, 313946) Take printing presses.
('67', 184, 1, 7, 313969) They will go on.
('67', 184, 1, 8, 313986) Take surgical instruments.
('67', 184, 1, 9, 314013) How can one make them with ones hands?
('67', 184, 1, 10, 314052) Heavy machinery would be needed for them.
('67', 184, 1, 11, 314094) But there is no machinery for the cure of idleness but this.
('67', 184, 1, 12, 314155) I can work it whilst I am carrying on this conversation with you, and am adding a little to the wealth of the country.
('67', 184, 1, 13, 314274) This machine no one can oust.

('67', 184, 3, 16, 314334) HELPLESS WIDOWS A bereaved friend sends a pathetic letter describing the plight of a 17 year old girl, who has lost in Quetta her husband, two months old child, father in law and her husbands younger brother, that is to say everybody in her father in laws house.
('67', 184, 3, 17, 314597) My correspondent adds that she escaped unhurt and returned with only her clothes on.
('67', 184, 3, 18, 314682) She is his uncles daughter and he does not know how to console her or what to do with her.
('67', 184, 3, 19, 314773) She herself is not undamaged.
('67', 184, 3, 20, 314803) Her leg has been injured, though fortunately the bone remains intact.
('67', 184, 3, 21, 314873) The correspondent concluded by saying:
('67', 184, 4, 22, 314912) I have left her with her mother in Lahore.
('67', 184, 4, 23, 314955) I gently mentioned to her and other relatives whether the girl might not be remarried.
('67', 184, 4, 24, 315042) Some listened to me sympathetically and some resented the proposal.
('67', 184, 4, 25, 315110) I have no doubt that many a girl must have suffered the same fate as this cousin of mine.
('67', 184, 4, 26, 315200) Will you say a word of encouragement to these unfortunate widows?
('67', 184, 4, 27, 315266) I do not know what my pen or voice can do in matters in which age long prejudices are concerned.
('67', 184, 4, 28, 315363) I have repeatedly said that every widow has as much right to remarry as every widower.
('67', 184, 4, 29, 315450) Voluntary widowhood is a priceless boon in Hinduism; enforced widowhood is a curse.
('67', 184, 4, 30, 315534) And I very much feel that many young widows if they were absolutely free, not so much from the fear of physical restraint as from the opprobrium of Hindu public opinion, would remarry
('67', 185, 0, 1, 315718) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 186
('67', 185, 1, 2, 315760) without the slightest hesitation.
('67', 185, 1, 3, 315794) All the young widows, therefore, who are in the unfortunate position of this bereaved sister from Quetta should have every inducement given to them to remarry, and should be sure that no blame would be attached to them if they chose to remarry, and every effort should be made to select for them suitable matches.
('67', 185, 1, 4, 316108) This is not work that can be done by any institution.
('67', 185, 1, 5, 316162) This work has got to be done by individual reformers whose relatives have become widows, and they have to carry on a vigorous, dignified and restrained propaganda in their own circles, and whenever they succeed they should give the widest publicity to the event.
('67', 185, 1, 6, 316425) Thus, and only thus, there is likely to be tangible relief provided for the girls who might have become widows during the earthquake.
('67', 185, 1, 7, 316559) It is possible that the public sympathy can be easily mobilized whilst the memory of the tragedy is fresh in mind, and if once the reform takes place on a large scale, the girls who may have become widows in the natural course will also find it easy to get married if they are willing to do so.
('67', 185, 2, 8, 316854) THE THREE SERVICES Khadi service, village service and Harijan service are all one in reality, though three in name.
('67', 185, 2, 9, 316970) They are purely humanitarian services with no other aim than that of serving Daridranarayana.
('67', 185, 2, 10, 317064) Harijans are the most down trodden among the millions of Daridranarayanas.
('67', 185, 2, 11, 317139) Their service necessarily includes that of all.
('67', 185, 2, 12, 317187) A cup of water served to a Harijan in the name of God is a cup served to all the neglected ones of humanity.
('67', 185, 2, 13, 317296) With services so conceived it is wrong to associate ideas of capital and labour.
('67', 185, 2, 14, 317377) From the unpaid chairmen to the salaried bearers all are servants.
('67', 185, 2, 15, 317444) The funds belong to the respective trusts.
('67', 185, 2, 16, 317487) All the servants, whether paid or unpaid, are subject to the rules framed from time to time by the respective boards.
('67', 185, 2, 17, 317605) Where the whole idea is one of duty, there is no question of privilege.
('67', 185, 2, 18, 317677) Anyone therefore in these services who thinks of privileges and rights is doomed some day or other to disappointment.
('67', 185, 2, 19, 317795) For in these services there is no gradual betterment of the economic condition; on the contrary, there is or there soon will be a progressive renunciation of material advantage.
('67', 185, 2, 20, 317973) Duty will be merit when debt becomes a donation. Duty done is its own reward.
('67', 185, 2, 21, 318051) Satisfaction there undoubtedly is in these services.
('67', 185, 2, 22, 318104) But it is that of having done ones duty.
('67', 185, 2, 23, 318145) It is true that all have not approached their tasks in the spirit of pure service.
('67', 185, 2, 24, 318228) Hence there have been exhibitions of distemper now and then in the oldest of the three services.
('67', 185, 2, 25, 318325) The only way to avoid a repetition of these distempers is to
('67', 186, 0, 1, 318386) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 187
('67', 186, 1, 2, 318433) remind ourselves that we are in these services merely to discharge our obligations to Daridranarayana, not to seek privileges.
('67', 186, 1, 3, 318560) We own no master but Daridranarayana, and if for the time being we own human superiors, we do so voluntarily, well knowing that no organization can be carried on without discipline.
('67', 186, 1, 4, 318742) Discipline presupposes an organizing head.
('67', 186, 1, 5, 318785) He is only the first among equals.
('67', 186, 1, 6, 318820) And being purely a servant, in order to be the head, he has to be the humblestof all his co servants.
('67', 186, 1, 7, 318922) He is there on sufferance.
('67', 186, 1, 8, 318949) But whilst he is there, he is entitled to the whole hearted allegiance and uncomplaining obedience of all the fellow servants.

('67', 186, 3, 10, 319095) 293. ALL LIFE IS ONE
('67', 186, 4, 11, 319116) During my brief visit to Borsad last month in several of my speeches I had said that, although I believed that even plague stricken rats and fleas were my kindred and had as much right to live as I had, I had no hesitation in endorsing Dr. Bhaskar Patels campaign against rats and fleas.
('67', 186, 4, 12, 319404) A reporter who was struck by this claim to kinship with rats and fleas, but not interested in the context in which I had said it, telegraphed to his paper the interesting claim I had advanced.
('67', 186, 4, 13, 319597) The Sardars eagle eye caught the paragraph and wanted me to correct the mischief it was likely to do.
('67', 186, 4, 14, 319699) Being immersed in the work he had entrusted me with, I excused myself by saying that the people concerned would not misunderstand me.
('67', 186, 4, 15, 319833) But perhaps the Sardar was right.
('67', 186, 4, 16, 319867) For the paragraph containing the half truth was wired to London.
('67', 186, 4, 17, 319932) Those who are jealous about my European reputation were agitated, though they had realized that my claim to kinship must have had large qualifications.
('67', 186, 4, 18, 320084) They have sent me the clipping containing the paragraph.
('67', 186, 4, 19, 320141) I am bound now, if only for the sake of these loving friends, to clear the position though the half truth having had a start cannot be overtaken at once.
('67', 186, 4, 20, 320295) I was in the midst of a population which would not kill wild animals that daily destroy their crops.
('67', 186, 4, 21, 320396) Before the Sardar threw the whole weight of his tremendous influence into the campaign of the destruction of rats and fleas, the people of the Borsad Taluka had not destroyed a single rat or flea.
('67', 186, 4, 22, 320593) But they could not resist the Sardar to whom they had owed much, and Dr. Bhaskar Patel was allowed to
('67', 187, 0, 1, 320695) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 188
('67', 187, 1, 2, 320737) carry on wholesale destruction of rats and fleas.
('67', 187, 1, 3, 320787) I was in daily touch with what was going on in Borsad.
('67', 187, 1, 4, 320842) The Sardar had invited me naturally to endorse what had been done.
('67', 187, 1, 5, 320909) For the work had still to continue, though henceforth with the peoples own unaided effort.
('67', 187, 1, 6, 321000) Therefore, in order to emphasize my endorsement, I redeclared in the clearest possible terms my implicit belief in ahimsa, i.e., sacredness and kinship of all life.
('67', 187, 1, 7, 321165) But why this contradiction between belief and action?
('67', 187, 1, 8, 321219) Contradiction is undoubtedly there.
('67', 187, 1, 9, 321255) Life is an aspiration.
('67', 187, 1, 10, 321278) Its mission is to strive after perfection which is self realization.
('67', 187, 1, 11, 321347) The ideal must not be lowered because of our weaknesses or imperfections.
('67', 187, 1, 12, 321421) I am painfully conscious of both in me.
('67', 187, 1, 13, 321461) The silent cry daily goes out to Truth to help me to remove these weaknesses and imperfections of mine.
('67', 187, 1, 14, 321565) I own my fear of snakes, scorpions, lions, tigers, plague stricken rats and fleas, even as I must own fear of evil looking robbers and murderers.
('67', 187, 1, 15, 321711) I know that I ought not to fear any of them.
('67', 187, 1, 16, 321756) But this is no intellectual feat.
('67', 187, 1, 17, 321790) It is a feat of the heart.
('67', 187, 1, 18, 321817) It needs more than a heart of oak to shed all fear except the fear of God.
('67', 187, 1, 19, 321892) I could not in my weakness ask the people of Borsad not to kill deadly rats and fleas.
('67', 187, 1, 20, 321979) But I knew that it was a concession to human weakness.
('67', 187, 1, 21, 322034) Nevertheless there is that difference between a belief in ahimsa and a belief in himsa which there is between north and south, life and death.
('67', 187, 1, 22, 322177) One who hooks his fortunes to ahimsa, the law of love, daily lessens the circle of destruction and to that extent promotes life and love; he who swears by himsa, the law of hate, daily widens the circle of destruction and to that extent promotes death and hate.
('67', 187, 1, 23, 322439) Though, before the people of Borsad, I endorsed the destruction of rats and fleas, my own kith and kin, I preached to them without adulteration the grand doctrine of the eternal Law of love of all life.
('67', 187, 1, 24, 322642) Though I may fail to carry it out to the full in this life, my faith in it shall abide.
('67', 187, 1, 25, 322730) Every failure brings me nearer the realization.

('67', 187, 3, 27, 322797) 294. FAECES AS CATTLE FOOD
('67', 187, 4, 28, 322824) I have seen in childhood in Porbandar cows freely eating human faeces.
('67', 187, 4, 29, 322895) The practice appeared to me to be revolting and the feeling has persisted to this day.
('67', 187, 4, 30, 322982) But a correspondent wrote telling me that in Satara district it was the usual thing for gwalis to pay for the right of
('67', 188, 0, 1, 323101) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 189
('67', 188, 1, 2, 323148) getting access to the pekhanas of people so that their cattle may eat the faeces from day to day.
('67', 188, 1, 3, 323246) The correspondent said that the feeding of cow with faeces increased the yield of milk.
('67', 188, 1, 4, 323334) Having no reason to doubt my correspondents veracity I asked a medical friend to obtain an experts opinion on the statement.
('67', 188, 1, 5, 323459) Here is the startling opinion:
('67', 188, 2, 6, 323490) Normal faeces contain some nutritive material in the form of cellulose and nitrogenous material.
('67', 188, 2, 7, 323587) The main substance in the faeces which might produce some physiological action on the animal feeding on them is vitamin B. That vitamin B is present in the faeces was shown by Cooper (1914).
('67', 188, 2, 8, 323778) He cured polyneuritic pigeons by administering an alcoholic extract of faeces.
('67', 188, 2, 9, 323857) There seems to be general agreement that the nursing animal requires an increased amount of vitamin B in order to suckle her young successfully. (Vide Monograph on Vitamins published by Pickett Thomson Research Laboratory, London.)
('67', 188, 3, 10, 324089) It is quite possible that animals feeding on faeces get a liberal supply of this vitamin which ensures a copious secretion of milk from the active mammary gland.
('67', 188, 4, 11, 324251) Lack of appetite and deficient utilization of food are well marked characteristics of vitamin B deficiency in the diet, and it is quite likely that cows that feed on faeces along with other vegetable foodstuffs will put on fat owing to stimulation of appetite by vitamin B and greater utilization of carbohydrate food which is mostly transformed into fat in herbivorous animals.
('67', 188, 5, 12, 324630) As regards the bacteria, etc., which are normally to be found in the stools of human beings, it may be said that most of them are dead or dying bacteria and that the few that survive are killed by the gastric juice in the cows stomach.
('67', 188, 5, 13, 324866) Thus though the chemical evidence in favour of human excreta as good food for cattle may be said to be established, the psychological objection will persist.

('67', 188, 7, 15, 325043) 295. WELLS FOR HARIJANS
('67', 188, 8, 16, 325067) Though the spectre of stricken Quetta haunts me still, I have neither compunction nor hesitation in asking the benevolent to respond quickly to the appeal for the Harijan Wells Fund published in these columns.
('67', 188, 8, 17, 325277) Quetta has the whole world at its back.
('67', 188, 8, 18, 325317) Harijans have only a few to help them.
('67', 188, 8, 19, 325356) Not one sufferer from the Quetta disaster has to languish for thirst or to be obliged to drink filthy water which people would not have their cattle to drink.
('67', 189, 0, 1, 325515) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 190
('67', 189, 1, 2, 325557) We may not lose the sense of proportion in the face of over whelming disasters.
('67', 189, 1, 3, 325637) Not even the gaieties of people have been stopped except perhaps in some cases for a solitary moment.
('67', 189, 1, 4, 325739) Must the burden of the Quetta grief fall on the already bruised shoulder of the Harijan?
('67', 189, 1, 5, 325828) Donors would be guilty of misappropriation before Gods court, if they were to divert what they had intended for giving clean drinking water to Harijans or begrudge Harijans because the unexpected call of Quetta has come.
('67', 189, 1, 6, 326049) The proper way is to revise the budget of personal expenses, not that of charities, least of the penetential which the Harijan Wells Fund is.
('67', 189, 1, 7, 326191) It was not without purpose or experience that the appeal for prayer was made.
('67', 189, 1, 8, 326269) Heart felt prayer steadies ones nerves, humbles one and clearly shows one the next step.
('67', 189, 1, 9, 326358) Let the readers study the Punjab report on the drinking needs of the Harijans of that land of five mighty rivers.
('67', 189, 1, 10, 326472) Is it not a shame that the rich people of the Punjab cannot provide clean water for Harijans?
('67', 189, 1, 11, 326566) The appeal for a paltry lakh of rupees should be speedily over subscribed.

('67', 190, 10, 13, 327413) I got your two letters, the one written from home and the other from the store.
('67', 190, 10, 14, 327493) You need not give any statement to the Press.
('67', 190, 10, 15, 327539) We shall send one, if necessary, when there is a union of hearts.
('67', 190, 10, 16, 327605) What Ratubhai said was painful.
('67', 190, 10, 17, 327637) I am writing to him.
('67', 190, 10, 18, 327658) Just now you should not take any step without consulting me.
('67', 190, 10, 19, 327719) Have patience and do not worry.
('67', 190, 10, 20, 327751) About effecting economy, too, we shall think together.
('67', 190, 10, 21, 327806) I will call Vallabhdas.
('67', 190, 10, 22, 327830) Send your whole scheme.
('67', 190, 10, 23, 327854) I will call Ratubhai, if necessary.
('67', 190, 10, 24, 327890) Take action about Lakshmidas also after consulting me.
('67', 190, 10, 25, 327945) Just now when things are going wrong everywhere, we should take every step carefully.
('67', 190, 10, 26, 328031) Do not endanger your health in doing this work.

('67', 191, 9, 12, 328646) BHAI MOOLCHAND,
('67', 191, 10, 13, 328662) I have your letter.
('67', 191, 10, 14, 328682) Yours is a sad tale, but you can make it a means of dharma.
('67', 191, 10, 15, 328742) Compassion subserves dharma.
('67', 191, 10, 16, 328771) Dharma is put to test in adversity.
('67', 191, 10, 17, 328807) When a wife does not follow the husband, how can she become his help mate?
('67', 191, 10, 18, 328882) She has a right to follow a different dharma and so has the husband.
('67', 191, 10, 19, 328951) But when a wife follows an opposite dharma, she should not expect co operation or cohabitation from the husband.
('67', 191, 10, 20, 329064) She has every right to get maintenance from the husband.
('67', 191, 10, 21, 329121) A husband who can be passionless towards his wife, and who remains and would remain passionless towards other women, has a right to part with his wife under such circumstances.
('67', 191, 10, 22, 329298) So she should have complete freedom to stay away from you and live her own life.
('67', 191, 10, 23, 329379) There is no cause for anger here.
('67', 191, 10, 24, 329413) Let no harsh word be said to the wife.
('67', 191, 10, 25, 329452) She should be reminded of her dharma affectionately; and non co operation should follow.
('67', 191, 10, 26, 329541) Then comes the problem of the children.
('67', 191, 10, 27, 329581) As long as the children do not attain the age of 16, they must be in your custody.
('67', 191, 10, 28, 329664) After that it is up to them to decide where to stay and whom to obey.

('67', 192, 3, 4, 329892) AVADHESH,
('67', 192, 4, 5, 329902) You cannot do social service by neglecting your duty to your father, mother and wife.
('67', 192, 4, 6, 329988) This duty is not opposed to social service.
('67', 192, 4, 7, 330032) It is necessary to understand the nature and scope of ones duty to ones mother and father.
('67', 192, 4, 8, 330123) It is the duty of a husband to provide for his wife and to live with her, with due restraint, as long as she can tread the same path of duty.
('67', 192, 4, 9, 330265) If the mother and father are invalid or poor and if they have no other son, it becomes ones duty to provide for them and to serve them.
('67', 192, 4, 10, 330401) I take goats milk as I was driven to it.
('67', 192, 4, 11, 330442) My vow prevented me from taking cows or buffalos milk.
('67', 192, 4, 12, 330497) I resorted to a narrow interpretation of the vow and secured the freedom to take goats milk.
('67', 192, 4, 13, 330590) If one wants to avoid cooked food, one can do with fruit only.

('67', 193, 12, 18, 331982) My suggestion 3 not only does not contain anything inviting fresh expenditure but it contains a proposition that will cost you nothing.
('67', 193, 12, 19, 332118) Paying for any fresh labour may be put in and may lead to payment of part or whole of the proved expenditure on the great effort you made in order to win the prize.
('67', 193, 12, 20, 332283) I told you when we met in Wardha and I repeat what I said then
('67', 193, 13, 21, 332346) 1 This was in reply to a telegram of even date from the addressee, which read: Passport granted.

('67', 194, 1, 3, 332783) For the time being this proposal has nothing to do with the Association 1 because the idea is wholly mine.
('67', 194, 1, 4, 332890) If we came to a workable understanding, I would endeavour to interest the Association in the proposal.

('67', 194, 6, 12, 333332) I had fear that mother would not be able to restrain herself.
('67', 194, 6, 13, 333394) Both she and you would try your joint best to prevent father from interrupting his cure.
('67', 194, 6, 14, 333483) I do hope that Kichis wound is still healing.
('67', 194, 6, 15, 333529) I know how troublesome these little operations are even for people in robust health.

('67', 196, 10, 20, 336561) 2 Though fashionable, the latter is still regarded an evil.
('67', 196, 10, 21, 336621) The puzzles competition is not.

('67', 198, 4, 5, 338297) Herewith your first exercise.
('67', 198, 4, 6, 338327) 1 You can now send the Gujarati exercises directly to Maganbhai.
('67', 198, 4, 7, 338392) However, you may send them to me if you wish.
('67', 198, 4, 8, 338438) This has been delayed in returning.
('67', 198, 4, 9, 338474) It lay with me for three days.
('67', 198, 4, 10, 338505) And since it was the first, Maganbhai also took some time over it.
('67', 198, 4, 11, 338572) The English [exercise] seems to have been lost.
('67', 198, 4, 12, 338620) It is being searched for.
('67', 198, 4, 13, 338646) If it is not found, I will frame a new exercise and send it.
('67', 198, 4, 14, 338707) This work will remain in my charge for the time being.
('67', 198, 4, 15, 338762) Ask every time you do not understand a point.
('67', 198, 4, 16, 338808) That will help you to make very great progress.
('67', 198, 4, 17, 338856) If you are one in a class of 20, you will receive 1/20 of the attention paid to the class.
('67', 198, 4, 18, 338947) Through correspondence you will receive individual attention.
('67', 198, 4, 19, 339009) Tuition by correspondence can help an industrious pupil a great deal.

('67', 198, 9, 29, 339404) Use a reed pen and write slowly.
('67', 198, 9, 30, 339437) Your English is better than I had thought.
('67', 198, 9, 31, 339480) It will improve very quickly.
('67', 198, 9, 32, 339510) After I get a list of the books you have with you, I will let you know which of them you should use for your study.
('67', 198, 9, 33, 339626) Just now take up Pathmala, Part I, and make a start with it.
('67', 198, 9, 34, 339687) You will find the first few lessons easy.
('67', 198, 9, 35, 339729) Start translating from the point where you find

('67', 201, 3, 4, 342852) NARANDAS, If I am routing all my letters to Harilal through you, there is some purpose behind it, viz., to enable you to know what your relationship with Harilal should be although you may not take part in the inquiry.
('67', 201, 3, 5, 343071) This question has become one of very great importance to me, as you will see from my letters to him.
('67', 201, 3, 6, 343172) Still, even after reading all these letters, you are free to form your own impression of Harilal and act accordingly.
('67', 201, 3, 7, 343290) If you have to feed him, you may give him any work to do which involves no risk.
('67', 201, 3, 8, 343371) But this does not mean that you are bound to maintain relations with him or give him work.
('67', 201, 3, 9, 343462) The bond of blood relationship also has its limits.
('67', 201, 3, 10, 343514) It shouldnt make us violate moral principles.
('67', 201, 3, 11, 343560) Harilal cannot have greater claims on you than a stranger placed in similar circumstances.
('67', 201, 3, 12, 343651) We should rather be more generous towards a stranger and more miserly towards Harilal.
('67', 201, 3, 13, 343738) That is, the more intimate the blood relationship, the stricter should our attitude be.
('67', 201, 3, 14, 343826) Only thus can we do pure justice.

('67', 201, 8, 21, 344197) Have you given the assurance to any one of them?
('67', 201, 8, 22, 344246) They have said so and published it too.
('67', 201, 8, 23, 344286) I am asking you this question because some important changes have got to be made because of the new policy .

('67', 202, 4, 5, 344613) I got your letter.
('67', 202, 4, 6, 344632) Do not give notice to Ganatra just now.
('67', 202, 4, 7, 344672) If there is no typing work you may give him any other work.
('67', 202, 4, 8, 344732) Do give him typing, however, if there is any to be done.
('67', 202, 4, 9, 344789) As for other changes, everything depends on when you are ready.
('67', 202, 4, 10, 344853) Such changes as occur to me can be carried out even through correspondence with Shankerlal.
('67', 202, 4, 11, 344945) Jamnalalji is arriving on the 7th without fail.
('67', 202, 4, 12, 344993) Everything thus depends on your convenience.
('67', 202, 4, 13, 345038) I am in favour of drastic economy measures.
('67', 202, 4, 14, 345082) I will, therefore, go all out to help you in that respect.
('67', 202, 4, 15, 345141) Hemprabhadevi has charged that after agreeing to buy goods from Khadi Pratishthan you changed your mind.
('67', 202, 4, 16, 345246) I once asked you about it, but you seem to have completely forgotten the question.
('67', 202, 4, 17, 345329) As Shankerlal is not keeping good health, I want him to remain in Ooty for as long as possible.

('67', 202, 10, 28, 345826) I waited for the second post, but there was none.
('67', 202, 10, 29, 345876) Ba also didnt bring any letter.
('67', 202, 10, 30, 345908) And so I sent the wire.
('67', 202, 10, 31, 345932) I didnt like the statement at all.

('67', 203, 1, 5, 346475) Since you have accepted its necessity, I neednt write anything more.
('67', 203, 1, 6, 346544) I should like to see the revised draft of the statement before it is issued.
('67', 203, 1, 7, 346621) If Mahadev has got all the facts with him, he can draft the statement here.

('67', 204, 4, 6, 347698) You should send me every week a list of contributors for publication in Harijan.

('67', 204, 9, 17, 348148) You should have some patience.
('67', 204, 9, 18, 348179) Once the work gets going it will proceed smoothly.
('67', 204, 9, 19, 348230) For the present you should write one letter every week.
('67', 204, 9, 20, 348286) Whenever you wish, however, you can write two lessons, one in Gujarati and one in English.
('67', 204, 9, 21, 348377) But despatch both on the same day.
('67', 204, 9, 22, 348412) That will save one stamp.
('67', 204, 9, 23, 348438) Maganbhai will need three days after the receipt of your letter and you can accordingly calculate the date on which you may expect a reply.
('67', 204, 9, 24, 348578) If your letters are received here on the same day of the week, you will get the reply, too, on the same day.
('67', 204, 9, 25, 348687) If along with your weight your strength also increases, you need not worry in the least about the increase in weight.
('67', 204, 9, 26, 348805) Your weight can easily be 110 pounds.
('67', 204, 9, 27, 348843) You have correctly grasped the argument in my article 2. I think it more advisable to encourage a child widow to marry again rather than that she should pretend, under social pressure, to observe self

('67', 205, 1, 4, 349251) Her widowhood will then be an adornment.
('67', 205, 1, 5, 349292) For the English book, get the Nelson Reader just now.
('67', 205, 1, 6, 349346) Copy out and send fifteen lines from it every week in the most careful handwriting together with a translation of them in equally good handwriting.

('67', 205, 5, 11, 349732) June 28, 1935
('67', 205, 7, 12, 349746) I have your letter.
('67', 205, 7, 13, 349766) I appreciate your keen desire [for studies].
('67', 205, 7, 14, 349811) But I am afraid I will not be able to help you much in the matter.
('67', 205, 7, 15, 349878) However much time I may devote to you I will always consider it as insufficient.
('67', 205, 7, 16, 349959) It would be like the proverbial recluse who, hankering after this world as well as the next, ruins his prospects in both.
('67', 205, 7, 17, 350081) So it is better if you join the Vinaya Mandir at Ahmedabad or a high school at Rajkot or Bhavnagar.
('67', 205, 7, 18, 350181) If I cannot afford to send you to a high school, there is nothing else that I can do to satisfy your craving.
('67', 205, 7, 19, 350291) If you come to me I shall certainly help you in learning English and Arithmetic thoroughly.
('67', 205, 7, 20, 350383) But you cannot lay down any conditions with me.
('67', 205, 7, 21, 350431) The main thing is the work here and anything that has to be done is by way of service.
('67', 205, 7, 22, 350518) Of course the best course would be to come to me.
('67', 205, 7, 23, 350568) I too would welcome it but staying with me means learning to serve and making progress in it.
('67', 205, 7, 24, 350662) Even acquiring knowledge is for the sake of service.
('67', 205, 7, 25, 350715) Dont hesitate to write to me.
('67', 205, 7, 26, 350745) I shall try to guide you if you keep on writing to me.

('67', 206, 1, 2, 350932) 329. DUTY OF BREAD LABOUR
('67', 206, 2, 3, 350958) Brahma created his people with the duty of sacrifice laid upon them and said: By this do you flourish.
('67', 206, 2, 4, 351061) Let it be the fulfiller of all your desires. He who eats without performing this sacrifice eats stolen bread.
('67', 206, 2, 5, 351171) Thus says the Gita.
('67', 206, 2, 6, 351191) Earn thy bread by the sweat of thy brow, says the Bible.
('67', 206, 2, 7, 351248) Sacrifices may be of many kinds.
('67', 206, 2, 8, 351281) One of them may well be bread labour.
('67', 206, 2, 9, 351319) If all laboured for their bread and no more, then there would be enough food and enough leisure for all.
('67', 206, 2, 10, 351424) Then there would be no cry of over population, no disease, and no such misery as we see around.
('67', 206, 2, 11, 351520) Such labour will be the highest form of a sacrifice.
('67', 206, 2, 12, 351573) Men will no doubt do many other things either through their bodies or through their minds, but all this will be labour of love, for the common good.
('67', 206, 2, 13, 351722) There will then beno rich and no poor, none high and none low, no touchable and no untouchable.
('67', 206, 2, 14, 351818) This may be an unattainable ideal.
('67', 206, 2, 15, 351853) But we need not, therefore, cease to strive for it.
('67', 206, 2, 16, 351905) Even if without fulfilling the whole law of sacrifice, that is, the law of our being, we performed physical labour enough for our daily bread, we should go a long way towards the ideal.
('67', 206, 2, 17, 352091) If we did so, our wants would be minimized, our food would be simple.
('67', 206, 2, 18, 352161) We should then eat to live, not live to eat.
('67', 206, 2, 19, 352206) Let anyone who doubts the accuracy of this proposition try to sweat for his bread, he will derive the greatest relish from the productions of his labour, improve his health and discover that many things he took were superfluities.
('67', 206, 2, 20, 352437) May not men earn their bread by intellectual labour?
('67', 206, 2, 21, 352490) The needs of the body must be supplied by the body.
('67', 206, 2, 22, 352542) Render unto Caesar that which is Caesars perhaps applies here well.
('67', 206, 2, 23, 352610) Mere mental, that is, intellectual labour is for the soul and is its own satisfaction.
('67', 206, 2, 24, 352697) It should never demand payment.
('67', 206, 2, 25, 352729) In the ideal State, doctors, lawyers and the like will work solely for the benefit of society, not for self.
('67', 206, 2, 26, 352838) Obedience to the law of bread labour will bring about a silent revolution in the structure of society.
('67', 206, 2, 27, 352941) Mans triumph will consist in substituting the struggle for existence by the struggle for mutual service.
('67', 206, 2, 28, 353046) The law of the brute will be replaced by the law of man.
('67', 207, 0, 1, 353103) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 208
('67', 207, 1, 2, 353145) Return to the villages means a definite voluntary recognition of the duty of bread labour and all it connotes.
('67', 207, 1, 3, 353256) But says the critic, millions of Indias children are today living in the villages and yet they are living a life of semi starvation.
('67', 207, 1, 4, 353389) This, alas, is but too true.
('67', 207, 1, 5, 353418) Fortunately we know that theirs is not voluntary obedience.
('67', 207, 1, 6, 353478) They would perhaps shirk body labour if they could, and even rush to the nearest city if they could be accommodated in it.
('67', 207, 1, 7, 353601) Compulsory obedience to a master is state of slavery, willing obedience to ones father is the glory of sonship.
('67', 207, 1, 8, 353713) Similarly compulsory obedience to the law of bread labour breeds poverty, disease and discontent.
('67', 207, 1, 9, 353811) It is a state of slavery.
('67', 207, 1, 10, 353837) Willing obedience to it must bring contentment and health.
('67', 207, 1, 11, 353896) And it is health which is real wealth, not pieces of silver and gold.
('67', 207, 1, 12, 353966) The Village Industries Association is an experiment in willing bread labour.

('67', 207, 3, 14, 354062) 330. IMPROVEMENT IN SPINNING
('67', 207, 4, 15, 354091) Investigations made in Savli, one of the good centres of khadi production, reveal the fact that the spinners there earn no more than one pie per hour on an average.
('67', 207, 4, 16, 354256) Fortunately they have other sources of income or they are members of families whose other members are following some more remunerative occupations.
('67', 207, 4, 17, 354404) But a khadi servant cannot afford to be satisfied with this knowledge.
('67', 207, 4, 18, 354475) He must devise means of increasing the spinners wage.
('67', 207, 4, 19, 354529) There are three ways of doing it: (1) By paying a higher wage and increasing the price of commercial khadi.
('67', 207, 4, 20, 354637) (2) By inviting the ginners, carders and weavers to divide their wages with the spinners.
('67', 207, 4, 21, 354727) (3) By making improvements in the existing wheels and by teaching the spinners to be more careful than they are.
('67', 207, 4, 22, 354840) If this last was not possible, one of the first two alternatives would be obligatory, but improvement in the existing machines and in the spinners manners is undoubtedly possible.
('67', 207, 4, 23, 355020) Had Messrs Kirloskars efforts come up to mark, the spinners wage would easily have gone up to nine pies per hour.
('67', 207, 4, 24, 355134) But that was not to be.
('67', 207, 4, 25, 355158) Though it was easily the best among all the attempts submitted to the A. I. S. A., it was not considered by the judges to satisfy the tests laid down for a cottage machine.
('67', 207, 4, 26, 355331) It could not replace the existing machines.
('67', 207, 4, 27, 355375) Let us hope that neither Kirloskar Bros.
('67', 207, 4, 28, 355416) nor other inventors will give up the
('67', 208, 0, 1, 355453) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 209
('67', 208, 1, 2, 355500) attempt.
('67', 208, 1, 3, 355509) Though the prize has been withdrawn, I have no doubt that the Association will always be prepared to examine any promising effort and give the full reward if a really handy, easy working machine is forthcoming.
('67', 208, 1, 4, 355720) But till that happy time comes, if it ever does, improvements in the existing machines must not be despised.
('67', 208, 1, 5, 355829) Shri Shankerlal Banker has been concentrating on one essential improvement, speed of the spindle.
('67', 208, 1, 6, 355927) The revolutions of the spindle have been found to be as low as 35 to 1 of the turning wheel.
('67', 208, 1, 7, 356020) The result has been that the average output is not more than 150 yards per hour, if not even 100 yards.
('67', 208, 1, 8, 356124) The highest attained has been over 800 yards.
('67', 208, 1, 9, 356170) If the speed of the spindle can be improved, the average and therefore the wage can be easily doubled.
('67', 208, 1, 10, 356273) This can be effected by using thinner spindles, thinner mals (wheel strings) and reducing the circumference of the little pulley round the spindle.
('67', 208, 1, 11, 356421) These are but illustrations of the way in which improvements can be easily made.
('67', 208, 1, 12, 356502) But no improvement is possible unless khadi workers master the science of spinning.
('67', 208, 1, 13, 356586) They must know both the theory and the practice.
('67', 208, 1, 14, 356635) They must study the incredibly simple construction of the existing machines and the function of each part.
('67', 208, 1, 15, 356742) They must themselves be expert ginners, carders and spinners.
('67', 208, 1, 16, 356804) And they must take a lively interest in the welfare of the spinners.
('67', 208, 1, 17, 356873) This means overhauling the khadi service.
('67', 208, 1, 18, 356915) The sooner it is done, the better it will be for all concerned.
('67', 208, 1, 19, 356979) We must not be satisfied with the indifferent work of spinners, when we know that better is easily possible.

('67', 208, 4, 22, 357118) THE GAMBLING EVIL
('67', 208, 5, 23, 357136) A correspondent from Bombay writes a pathetic letter on the growing evil of gambling.
('67', 208, 5, 24, 357222) Below is a free translation of the telling passages of the letter: If the canker is eating into the vitals of the simple village folk of Gujarat, it is invading titled men, barristers, doctors, merchants and even teachers who are expected to guard national morals.
('67', 208, 5, 25, 357487) Even the police are said not to be free from the vice.
('67', 208, 5, 26, 357542) Women, children of tender age and blind beggars are not free from the vice.
('67', 208, 5, 27, 357618) Some newspapers thrive on advertising the evil.
('67', 208, 5, 28, 357666) It goes on unchecked in
('67', 209, 0, 1, 357690) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 210
('67', 209, 1, 2, 357732) spite of the effort of some reformers.
('67', 209, 1, 3, 357771) May not growing poverty and consequent unemployment be the cause of the evil?
('67', 209, 1, 4, 357849) I do not think so.
('67', 209, 1, 5, 357868) No doubt unemployment favours the spread.
('67', 209, 1, 6, 357910) But the causes are much deeper.
('67', 209, 1, 7, 357942) The very fact that the vice has affected all classes must make us cautious and lead us to make deeper investigations into the causes.
('67', 209, 2, 8, 358076) SUGAR v.
('67', 209, 2, 9, 358085) GUR Testimony in favour of gur over sugar is daily accumulating.
('67', 209, 2, 10, 358150) Shri Shankerlal Banker who is touring in the Ooty regions sends the following analysis prepared for him by a chemist friend, showing the copper content in milligrams in one kilogram each of the samples submitted for analysis: Singanallur sugar 0.61 Aska sugar 1.93 Gur Anakapalli 7.48 Gur Singanallur 7.67 Molasses 5.70 Sugar Candy (cane) 4.98 Palmyra Candy 7.40 Thus it is a double waste of money to use sugar instead of gur.

('67', 210, 8, 23, 360014) I must not write about it to Agatha.
('67', 210, 8, 24, 360051) You will remember this sentence in her letter: For we look to Mahatmaji to be above the battle.
('67', 210, 8, 25, 360147) Am I right in thinking that the events of the past year are wearing him down? If you feel with me that the events are not wearing me down and that I am above the battle then you must give her the assurance on my behalf and tell her that I am not hopeless about the whole thing.
('67', 210, 8, 26, 360425) Only I cant build hope on a foundation of sand.
('67', 210, 8, 27, 360473) It is truth on the rock of Faith which persists in the face of appearances to the contrary.

('67', 211, 1, 2, 360803) us here, and I am quite clear in my mind that when we have discharged our trust here, real friendship between England and India will come.
('67', 211, 1, 3, 360942) Those Indians who believe in non violence must not go unless they are able to testify that politically conscious India has no hatred for Englishmen, but that it has nothing but goodwill towards them, if not active love.
('67', 211, 1, 4, 361162) Rajagopalachari cannot bear that testimony today.
('67', 211, 1, 5, 361212) And what is the use of his going to ask Englishmen to do their duty even though Indians cannot surmount their unregenerate nature and like the rest of mankind hate those who they believe persecute them?
('67', 211, 1, 6, 361415) Do you not see my argument quite clearly?
('67', 211, 1, 7, 361457) I am dictating so much on one sentence in Agathas letter, because I realize the distress of her mind and I want to soothe her and those who feel like her.
('67', 211, 1, 8, 361612) About the Simla incident you will have to put up with it a little longer.
('67', 211, 1, 9, 361686) But what does it matter that bitter criticism is levelled against you.
('67', 211, 1, 10, 361757) You said the correct word 1 and that is its own satisfaction.
('67', 211, 1, 11, 361819) About the rest of your letter and the enclosures I expect you do not want any reply.
('67', 211, 1, 12, 361904) I hope Khambhatta is making steady progress and that you had time to look into his charges against Hospital management.
('67', 211, 1, 13, 362024) I must not forget one thing.
('67', 211, 1, 14, 362053) You wont disturb your programme owing to Agathas letter.
('67', 211, 1, 15, 362110) Let things take their course.
('67', 211, 1, 16, 362140) You are quite right in wanting the little bit of rest [sic] from the agonizing toil that Agatha is going through.
('67', 211, 1, 17, 362254) That of course can happen only when you are there.
('67', 211, 1, 18, 362305) But meanwhile you can soothe her while insisting on her hastening slowly and on being careful for nothing.

('67', 212, 2, 6, 363250) I hope you will not have to go to Calcutta for that.
('67', 212, 2, 7, 363303) Dr. Kellogg has not sent a reply.
('67', 212, 2, 8, 363337) It should have come.
('67', 212, 2, 9, 363358) I shall make other arrangements.
('67', 212, 2, 10, 363391) Shri P.s letter contains nothing.

('67', 212, 2, 12, 363489) I have not attached any weight to his letter.
('67', 212, 2, 13, 363535) That is why I did not write to you about it.

('67', 212, 10, 24, 364051) If for the goodwill a payment has to be made to Premchandji 1, then I personally would prefer to start an independent paper.
('67', 212, 10, 25, 364176) We would be able to secure the services of some Hindi writer.

('67', 213, 1, 3, 364466) Let us not decide in too much hurry.
('67', 213, 1, 4, 364503) After the decision is taken, we shall approach Gurudev.
('67', 213, 1, 5, 364559) I hesitate to write to him myself because he [might agree to write] something even against his will through sheer courtesy.
('67', 213, 1, 6, 364683) When the time comes I will ask Mahadev to write.
('67', 213, 1, 7, 364732) Or else you may write.
('67', 213, 1, 8, 364755) Your leaflet is bound to mention my name in some connection and that will amount to an invitation [from me].
('67', 213, 1, 9, 364864) I hope you have benefited from your stay in Panchgani.
('67', 213, 1, 10, 364919) It will also be necessary before starting Hansa to make sure where the money is to come from.

('67', 213, 6, 15, 365140) NARANDAS,
('67', 213, 7, 16, 365150) Read my letter 1 to Harilal.
('67', 213, 7, 17, 365179) It will perhaps help you to see what you should do.
('67', 213, 7, 18, 365231) I am not yet ready to order you, but I think Bali 2, Kumi and Manu are right.
('67', 213, 7, 19, 365309) Please warn me beforehand if you think they are wrong.
('67', 213, 7, 20, 365364) If they appear right to you and if Harilal does not confess his faults, then, you cannot keep him at all.
('67', 213, 7, 21, 365470) In no circumstances can anything be given to him in the shape of help from public funds.
('67', 213, 7, 22, 365559) He may certainly earn something by doing work.
('67', 213, 7, 23, 365606) This sums up my advice.
('67', 213, 7, 24, 365630) Think over it and act according to the promptings of your heart.

('67', 214, 3, 4, 366171) SHARMA, There is a letter 1 from Calcutta announcing the ships departure arround August 10. It also says that you must reach there 10 or 12 days earlier.
('67', 214, 3, 5, 366325) They will arrange for your visa for America.
('67', 214, 3, 6, 366370) Who sent you the newspaper cutting 2?
('67', 214, 3, 7, 366408) Anyway, we shall have more specific news in four or five days time.
('67', 214, 3, 8, 366476) Never mind the sea.
('67', 214, 3, 9, 366496) You have to leave only from Calcutta.

('67', 214, 7, 14, 366688) WARDHA, July 2, 1935
('67', 214, 8, 15, 366709) DEAR SITARAM SASTRI, As Khadi Samsthanam reports seem to contain nothing new I would advise you not to send them every month.
('67', 214, 8, 16, 366835) Send them only when there is anything new or striking in the way of conquest or defeat.
('67', 214, 8, 17, 366923) Efficiency of a high order comes only after meticulous attention to every little detail.
('67', 214, 8, 18, 367012) Even as the slightest looseness in a screw in the mechanism of a watch upsets its balance, how much more is it true of mental processes?
('67', 214, 8, 19, 367149) And the correctness or efficiency of mental processes is determined by the correctness of our work in daily life.
('67', 214, 8, 20, 367263) Now about barter.
('67', 214, 8, 21, 367281) Rs. 450 will do but why not the round sum of 500?
('67', 214, 8, 22, 367331) I think a gold medal is unnecessary.
('67', 214, 8, 23, 367368) The choice of Samsthanam khaddar may be given to the prize winner but the judge should be an economist.
('67', 214, 8, 24, 367472) I, therefore, suggest Sjt.
('67', 214, 8, 25, 367499) Kumarappa.
('67', 214, 8, 26, 367510) I do not think that many judges are necessary.
('67', 214, 8, 27, 367557) You may select another name.
('67', 214, 8, 28, 367586) Ramadas Pantulu may be a better name.
('67', 214, 8, 29, 367624) It may be worth while thinking of a
('67', 214, 9, 30, 367660) 1 Presumably from the Birla brothers, who were financing the addressees trip abroad.
('67', 214, 9, 31, 367745) 2 A friend of the addressee had sent him a cutting from a Calcutta newspaper reporting the addressees proposed trip to America.

('67', 215, 1, 4, 368009) I shall then work after my own style and publish it.
('67', 215, 1, 5, 368062) I am not publishing the account of the sixth Bharata Bhagya Yatra 1. It is the repetition of the same old thing.
('67', 215, 1, 6, 368175) It is enough for a people to know that it has become a permanent part of Vinaya Ashram.
('67', 215, 1, 7, 368263) If you have workers enough, I would like you to send some in the villages, one each.
('67', 215, 1, 8, 368348) That will make the workers resourceful and self supporting.
('67', 215, 1, 9, 368408) We shall thereby have a variety of experiences.
('67', 215, 1, 10, 368456) This village reconstruction work is the most difficult, as we have tackled.

('67', 215, 4, 15, 368682) Not revised July 2 ,1935
('67', 215, 5, 16, 368707) NARAHARI,
('67', 215, 6, 17, 368717) Mahadev left last night for Bombay.
('67', 215, 6, 18, 368753) I am redirecting your letter there.
('67', 215, 6, 19, 368789) Do you know any relation of Hari Singh?
('67', 215, 6, 20, 368829) I hope you have informed him.
('67', 215, 6, 21, 368859) I assume that he was duly cremated.
('67', 215, 6, 22, 368895) Who attended the funeral?
('67', 215, 6, 23, 368921) Where was Hari Singh sleeping?
('67', 215, 6, 24, 368952) Is the place safe?
('67', 215, 6, 25, 368971) Was he sleeping on a cot or on the ground?
('67', 215, 6, 26, 369014) Personally I believe that everbody dies only at the appointed hour, but because we do not know the hour and also because nobody welcomes death, we must take measures to save a mans life.
('67', 215, 6, 27, 369201) Looking at the matter thus, when we do not know definitely what bit a person, we must assume that it was a serpent and apply remedies accordingly.
('67', 215, 6, 28, 369348) We may take him to a doctor, or, if we do not do that, we can bi nd the vein so as to stop the flow of blood, cut open the spot where we suspect the person to have been bitten and put permanganate in the wound, apply a mud pack and keep him conscious anyhow.
('67', 215, 6, 29, 369607) We may even induce vomiting.
('67', 215, 6, 30, 369636) This can be done by thrusting ones fingers into the throat or by making the person drink warm water mixed with salt.
('67', 215, 6, 31, 369753) If the salt is in sufficient quantity, vomiting is bound to follow.
('67', 215, 6, 32, 369821) We should know from a doctor if there are other remedies also.
('67', 215, 7, 33, 369884) 1 A pilgrimage of workers organized by the addressee to convey the message of village service.

('67', 218, 3, 4, 372745) DEAR SATISH BABU,
('67', 218, 4, 5, 372763) I must now dictate this letter as my left hand cannot cope with all the correspondence.
('67', 218, 4, 6, 372851) I enclose herewith two letters.
('67', 218, 4, 7, 372883) Can you trace the books mentioned in one of them?
('67', 218, 4, 8, 372933) And will you examine the fire proof process copied from an American magazine?
('67', 218, 4, 9, 373011) At the time of replying you will return both the letters.
('67', 218, 4, 10, 373069) Now about the little storm that is going on there about Borkamata.
('67', 218, 4, 11, 373136) Why all this insistence on operation either?
('67', 218, 4, 12, 373181) Is it for the good of khadi?
('67', 218, 4, 13, 373210) I have not gone into the merits, though I have written to Jerajani so far as the sale of Khadi Pratishthan is concerned.
('67', 218, 4, 14, 373331) And I have his reply, the purport of which is that everything that has been done was done with the full concurrence of Vishwanath.
('67', 218, 4, 15, 373462) About Borkamata, Annada has been sending bitter letters to Shankerlal who has passed the correspondence on to me.
('67', 218, 4, 16, 373576) I have not the time to study it.
('67', 218, 4, 17, 373609) I implored Prafulla to settle the matter and he sends the following telegram: Met Hemprabha Devi, Satis Babu.
('67', 218, 4, 18, 373719) They justify steps.
('67', 218, 4, 19, 373739) So Borkamata competition continues.
('67', 218, 4, 20, 373775) Hemprabha Devis attitude disheartened me discussing details. Do you want me to go into the whole thing and decide or will you come to an understanding with Annada?

('67', 219, 4, 6, 374225) He has sent copies of it to Vallabhbhai and others.
('67', 219, 4, 7, 374277) Before that he had written to Nanabhai and Nanabhai had sent the letter to me.
('67', 219, 4, 8, 374356) Nanabhai had also replied to him but there seems to have been some misunderstanding on his part.
('67', 219, 4, 9, 374453) He should clarify the matter.
('67', 219, 4, 10, 374483) When I got that letter, I wrote to Jethalal and asked him to write whatever he wanted to.
('67', 219, 4, 11, 374573) The accompanying letter is in reply to that.
('67', 219, 4, 12, 374618) I myself can reply to many of the points in it, but that is not enough.
('67', 219, 4, 13, 374690) I must have your official reply.
('67', 219, 4, 14, 374723) Please, therefore, let me have it.
('67', 219, 4, 15, 374758) I had a letter from Harilal yesterday.
('67', 219, 4, 16, 374797) I could understand nothing in it.

('67', 220, 2, 3, 375108) July 3, 1935
('67', 220, 3, 4, 375121) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('67', 220, 4, 5, 375139) I got your letter.
('67', 220, 4, 6, 375158) Mahadev seems to have needlessly frightened you and got frightened himself.
('67', 220, 4, 7, 375234) I merely cautioned Harilal not to play any tricks on me lest he should lose me altogether.
('67', 220, 4, 8, 375325) But he seems to have been up to something of that kind and, therefore, has taken the warning.
('67', 220, 4, 9, 375419) There was a letter from Narandas saying that he had disappeared since two days ago.
('67', 220, 4, 10, 375503) If, therefore, he has not returned before now, it is five days since he left.
('67', 220, 4, 11, 375581) There is no fear at all of my taking his disappearance to heart.
('67', 220, 4, 12, 375646) He has been disappearing in this manner for a long time now.
('67', 220, 4, 13, 375707) Some outward signs of change in him had certainly roused my hopes, but how long can a man keep up pretence?
('67', 220, 4, 14, 375815) Please dont worry in the least.
('67', 220, 4, 15, 375847) I will not take any hasty step.
('67', 220, 4, 16, 375879) There is no need, either, for any such step now.
('67', 220, 4, 17, 375928) Apart from this, my health is excellent and I am working with the utmost care.
('67', 220, 4, 18, 376007) And ultimately it is Gods will that prevails.
('67', 220, 4, 19, 376053) As long as He wants to use me as an instrument of service, no harm will come to me.
('67', 220, 4, 20, 376137) And when the end does come, no precaution or remedy will avail.
('67', 220, 4, 21, 376201) Indias future is safe.
('67', 220, 4, 22, 376224) I see no sign at all for despair.
('67', 220, 4, 23, 376258) God will permit nothing that is not for the countrys good.
('67', 220, 4, 24, 376317) After you have recovered, your health will perhaps improve if you have your headquarters here.

('67', 220, 10, 31, 376594) What salary does Jayabehn get?
('67', 220, 10, 32, 376625) The fact that you have not trained even a single lady out of twenty five shows that there must be some defect in our system of teaching.

('67', 221, 1, 4, 376958) Please do not think for a moment that I say we just for the sake of formality.
('67', 221, 1, 5, 377037) I fully realize my own shortcomings.
('67', 221, 1, 6, 377074) I do regard myself as a teacher but I am a giant among pigmies.
('67', 221, 1, 7, 377138) All that I want to convey is that you must resolve to train someone up to your expectations from among our women.

('67', 221, 4, 14, 377505) I hope he is well.
('67', 221, 4, 15, 377524) Mahadev had told me about the talk [you had] with Seth Mathuradas.

('67', 221, 8, 21, 377847) Unrevised July 3, 1935
('67', 221, 9, 22, 377870) KRISHNACHANDRA, An eternal conflict goes on in our hearts between the divine and the demoniac, truth and untruth, knowledge and ignorance, light and darkness.
('67', 221, 9, 23, 378029) We should put up a struggle to our utmost but not beyond our strength.
('67', 221, 9, 24, 378100) Arjuna was overreaching himself when God dissuaded him.
('67', 221, 9, 25, 378156) To take an example, ahimsa is good but what should I do if I cannot rid myself of the fear of snakes?
('67', 221, 9, 26, 378258) When I have already killed it in my mind, but only shrink from putting the thought into action,

('67', 222, 0, 1, 378396) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 223
('67', 222, 1, 2, 378443) dharma indicates that I kill it in accordance with my nature.
('67', 222, 1, 3, 378505) The resolve not to kill it serves no purpose.
('67', 222, 1, 4, 378551) The same holds true in the instance of brahmacharya and the householders estate.
('67', 222, 1, 5, 378632) Observance of lifelong continence is undoubtedly worthy but those unable to control their passion should enter the holy state of matrimony as brahmacharya in such instances would be a mere mockery of it.
('67', 222, 1, 6, 378836) There is no contradiction here, only a matter of two distinct dharmas.
('67', 222, 2, 7, 378907) Yes, prayers are most essential.
('67', 222, 2, 8, 378940) They help one to cultivate a spontaneous habit of constant remembrance.
('67', 222, 2, 9, 379012) The quantity of neem leaves may be reduced if necessary.
('67', 222, 2, 10, 379069) I can judge the state of your health only when you come here.
('67', 222, 2, 11, 379131) There should be no faintness of heart now.
('67', 222, 2, 12, 379174) When you hope to gain your peace of mind with me you should promptly come over.

('67', 223, 6, 14, 380630) Your letters to me are love letters, each time I suppose not less than an hours effort even for youa ready and fast writer.
('67', 223, 6, 15, 380754) Now that we know each other so well, you can certainly save your time by writing only when you must.
('67', 223, 6, 16, 380855) Though I treasure your long letters, I would be satisfied with a mere postcard telling me of important events.
('67', 223, 6, 17, 380966) You have your work cut out for you at Poona.
('67', 223, 6, 18, 381011) Are you coming to Wardha on your way to Poona or on your way back or both ways?
('67', 223, 6, 19, 381091) The weather is much cooler just now.
('67', 223, 6, 20, 381128) I have shared your letter with Kumarappa 1. If you can establish contact with rickshaw pullers, it would be a great thing.
('67', 223, 6, 21, 381251) They can easily spin, weave and add to their meagre earnings.
('67', 223, 6, 22, 381313) I am sorry Krishnarao is leaving you.
('67', 223, 6, 23, 381351) Of course, ultimately you will have to rely upon yourself.
('67', 223, 6, 24, 381410) Though your arms may not be strong enough to work at the bow, it is good that you will know the process of carding.
('67', 223, 6, 25, 381526) That would enable you to regulate and control carding by others.
('67', 223, 6, 26, 381591) If your girls learn spinning, you will insist upon their carding.
('67', 223, 6, 27, 381657) Unless they do, they will never spin regularly.
('67', 223, 6, 28, 381705) And it is a bad job to

('67', 224, 1, 4, 381982) Some may gin, some others may do the carding, many can make slivers and all will spin.
('67', 224, 1, 5, 382069) The clothes you have for Quetta relief, may be sent to Dr. Gopichand 1 for the refugees in the Punjab, unless of course there are refugees in Simla itself, in which case you can distribute your clothes among them.
('67', 224, 1, 6, 382283) Only I fancy that in Simla you will have the most well to do refugees, whereas in Lahore the poorest must have congregated.
('67', 224, 1, 7, 382407) I shall hold on the money.
('67', 224, 1, 8, 382434) It can be sent where they have spent what is being collected now.
('67', 224, 1, 9, 382500) There is always in such calamities an ample fund in the beginning stages.
('67', 224, 1, 10, 382574) You need not get out of your Ville to sell those paper sheets and envelopes I have sent you.
('67', 224, 1, 11, 382667) I am in no hurry to have the price of them.
('67', 224, 1, 12, 382711) And ultimately even if they could not be sold there, there would not be any difficulty in selling them here, without any loss.
('67', 224, 1, 13, 382838) I know we cannot make the profits that you can, but you must not give undue labour to their sale.

('67', 225, 10, 18, 384376) It is natural that I was sorry to learn about your younger brothers death.
('67', 225, 10, 19, 384451) But, after all, since I have so many co workers, there is always news of somebodys death or birth, and joy and sorrow are balanced so equally that to say I feel sorry seems to be an exaggeration.
('67', 225, 10, 20, 384647) Moreover, if regarded rationally, death is not a curse, but is rather a gift from God, being a release from life.
('67', 225, 10, 21, 384761) This intellectual conviction has considerably blunted my feelings.
('67', 225, 10, 22, 384828) I should like you to see the matter in the same light and console yourself with that knowledge, and cultivate a greater spirit of service.

('67', 226, 9, 22, 385782) LILAVATI,
('67', 226, 10, 23, 385792) If you do not follow the corrections and the notes, do ask me.
('67', 226, 10, 24, 385855) Please improve your handwriting.
('67', 226, 10, 25, 385888) Make the letters large and keep your words separate.
('67', 226, 10, 26, 385941) I do not have any trouble [in correcting your lessons].
('67', 226, 10, 27, 385997) But I will appoint another teacher.
('67', 226, 10, 28, 386033) Meanwhile keep on sending [your lessons] to me.
('67', 226, 11, 29, 386081) 1. Normally we can say that s is used for living things and of for non living things; e.g., a mans leg but a leg of a table.
('67', 226, 11, 30, 386206) 2. Had is used for an action which is already over before another; e.g., He had eaten when I went to him; but He ate at 10 o'clock.
('67', 226, 11, 31, 386338) Had eaten is past perfect tense; ate is simple past tense.

('67', 227, 1, 3, 386590) As the main verb it denotes possession or relationship, e.g., He has a box.possession; He has a son.relationship.
('67', 227, 1, 4, 386704) When an action is complete, forms of have are used but when it is intended merely to suggest the past tense, forms of be are used.

('67', 227, 6, 10, 387018) RAMDAS,
('67', 227, 7, 11, 387026) I understand now why you have taken up the printing press work.
('67', 227, 7, 12, 387090) May it give you satisfaction.
('67', 227, 7, 13, 387120) My life has been spent in food and other experiments and the experiments will continue still.
('67', 227, 7, 14, 387214) I believe they have done no harm either to me or to the world because, whenever I have discovered an error, I have corrected it.
('67', 227, 7, 15, 387343) The neem leaves experiment was useful and is still continuing.
('67', 227, 7, 16, 387406) Even the tamarind experiment has done me nothing but good.
('67', 227, 7, 17, 387465) But I ate it in rather excessive quantity and therefore suffered for three quarters of an hour.
('67', 227, 7, 18, 387561) After that I have suffered no ill effects.
('67', 227, 7, 19, 387604) It was even necessary to eat it in excessive quantity.
('67', 227, 7, 20, 387659) Ba and Manu 1 have safely reached Delhi.
('67', 227, 7, 21, 387700) Kana is getting along so so .
('67', 227, 7, 22, 387730) 2 besides being something of a vagabond of course.
('67', 227, 7, 23, 387781) I have gone through the articles you have procured.
('67', 227, 7, 24, 387833) I thought .
('67', 227, 7, 25, 387845) 3 they have no force in them.
('67', 227, 7, 26, 387875) They may certainly be regarded harmless ....
('67', 227, 7, 27, 387920) 4 You should procure articles written in very good Gujarati .

('67', 228, 3, 5, 388495) 2 And you too should treat him in the same way.
('67', 228, 3, 6, 388543) You should have all liberty in respect of food.
('67', 228, 3, 7, 388591) But as you cannot bring yourself to accept the mode of life followed by Moolchandji you may live separately and do as you please.
('67', 228, 3, 8, 388721) This, however, does not absolve him of the duty of providing for your maintenance.

('67', 228, 5, 10, 388864) 362. HARIJAN CONFERENCE
('67', 228, 6, 11, 388888) On 16th June a Conference of workers in the Harijan cause was organized in Mysore under the auspices of the Mysore State Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('67', 228, 6, 12, 389030) Shrimati Rameshwari Nehru presided.
('67', 228, 6, 13, 389066) The following message was sent by the Dewan, Sir Mirza Ismail:
('67', 228, 7, 14, 389129) I am very glad to hear that the Mysore State Harijan Sevak Sangh is Organizing a conference of workers engaged in the noble cause of the uplift of the Depressed Classes, better known as Harijans, to review the result of the past years work and to settle future lines of action.
('67', 228, 7, 15, 389407) I need hardly say that I wish the conference all possible success.
('67', 228, 7, 16, 389474) The keen solicitude of His Highness the Maharaja and his Government for the well being and prosperity of the people extends, as is well known, to his subjects irrespective of their caste, creed or race.
('67', 228, 7, 17, 389677) The social and educational uplift of the Harijans, who form no small section of His Highnesss subjects, is therefore a matter which has received and will continue to receive the active sympathy and support of His Highnesss Government.
('67', 228, 7, 18, 389912) Various measures have been adopted by Government in recent years to ameliorate the conditions of this community.
('67', 228, 7, 19, 390025) In this task the co operation of the public and of such organizations as the Harijan Sevak Sangh of Bangalore is to be welcomed.
('67', 228, 7, 20, 390154) I wish this Sangh all success in its labours to create a higher tone in the social life of the community and to enable it to play its part in the public life of the State.

('67', 229, 0, 1, 390400) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 230
('67', 229, 1, 2, 390442) The conference passed many resolutions of local importance from which I take the following:
('67', 229, 2, 3, 390534) This conference appeals to Government to be pleased to grant the following additional facilities.
('67', 229, 3, 4, 390632) 1. Lands for the starting of agricultural colonies in the Irwin Canal Area and also under the Vani Vilas Sagara.
('67', 229, 4, 5, 390745) 2. Sites for the extension of Harijan quarters in the villages.
('67', 229, 5, 6, 390809) 3. Definite allotment in the budget for the provision of drinking water wells to Harijans in the villages.
('67', 229, 6, 7, 390916) 4. Increased grants to aided Harijan hostels, scholarships and exemption from the payment of sports and library fees.
('67', 229, 7, 8, 391034) 5. Preferential appointments to the Harijans who have passed the high schools and college examinations.
('67', 229, 8, 9, 391138) 6. Appointment of a Special Office with staff and budget provisions to look after the moral and material improvement of the Harijans in the State.
('67', 229, 9, 10, 391285) 7. Creation of an Educational Trust Fund and formation of an advisory board.
('67', 229, 10, 11, 391362) 8. Starting of a free boarding home for Harijan girls in Mysore.
('67', 229, 11, 12, 391427) 9. Permission to the Harijans to enter and worship in all temples under the management of the Muzrai Department.
('67', 229, 11, 13, 391540) Let us hope that these reasonable requests will be granted by the authorities and perfect equality established between the Harijans and the other citizens of the State.

('67', 229, 13, 15, 391727) 363. MISSION OF KHADI
('67', 229, 14, 16, 391749) The mission of khadi is not merely to supply the townspeople with fashionable khadi that will vie with the mill manufactures and thus like other industries supply a few artisans with employment, but is to become a supplementary industry to agriculture.
('67', 229, 14, 17, 392002) This mission still remains unfulfilled.
('67', 229, 14, 18, 392042) In order that it may fulfil this mission, it has to be self sustained and its use must spread in the villages.
('67', 229, 14, 19, 392153) Just as the villagers cook their own roti or rice so must they make their own khadi for personal use.
('67', 229, 14, 20, 392255) The surplus, if any, they may sell.
('67', 229, 14, 21, 392291) This mission cannot be delivered unless the khadi service changes its complexion and the Spinners Association its policy.
('67', 229, 14, 22, 392413) Every member of the khadi service should know the processes through which cotton passes before it becomes khadi.
('67', 230, 0, 1, 392526) VOL. 67: 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 231
('67', 230, 1, 2, 392573) When emphasis is put on self sufficient khadi, commercial production will be restricted to the real wants of townspeople.
('67', 230, 1, 3, 392695) It will then pass into the hands of private businessmen instead of being centralized in the hands of the Association.
('67', 230, 1, 4, 392813) In trying to commercialize khadi, the Association has been hitherto dominated by the ruling prices.
('67', 230, 1, 5, 392913) Thus the spinnings wage has been the worst of all the wages for any form of labour.
('67', 230, 1, 6, 392997) They have also varied with provinces.
('67', 230, 1, 7, 393035) Therefore the prices of khadi too have varied with the provinces.
('67', 230, 1, 8, 393101) It is all very well for more profiteering bodies to countenance and even stimulate cut throat competition, but associations whose sole purpose is to serve the pauper millions cannot afford to join such competition.
('67', 230, 1, 9, 393316) There is no reason why a spinner in Bihar should get less than her sister in Gujarat.
('67', 230, 1, 10, 393402) No doubt prices vary in different provinces because the standard of living varies.
('67', 230, 1, 11, 393485) But the Association cannot afford to take things as they are.
('67', 230, 1, 12, 393547) It has to change them, if they are unjust.
('67', 230, 1, 13, 393590) There is no reason why the price of one hours labour in spinning should be less than one in weaving.
('67', 230, 1, 14, 393691) There is more skill involved in spinning than in simple weaving.
('67', 230, 1, 15, 393756) Simple weaving is a purely mechanical process.
('67', 230, 1, 16, 393803) Simplest spinning requires the cunning of the hand.
('67', 230, 1, 17, 393855) Yet the spinner gets one pie per hour against the weavers minimum of six; the carder too does better, almost as well as the weaver, There are historical reasons for this state of things.
('67', 230, 1, 18, 394042) But they are not just merely because they are historical.
('67', 230, 1, 19, 394100) Time has come for the Association to equalize if not also to stabilize the prices of all labour regulated by it.
('67', 230, 1, 20, 394213) This, in many cases, will mean inviting the weaver to lower his scale of wages where he gets more than one anna per hour.
('67', 230, 1, 21, 394335) Time may never come when all the weavers will voluntarily consent to the equalization process.
('67', 230, 1, 22, 394430) But if the doctrine of equality of wages for all productive labour is sound, the Association must strive to approach the ideal as near as may be.
('67', 230, 1, 23, 394576) Unless the whole jump is taken at once, the beginning must be made with raising the wages of spinners to a decent level for a decent hours work.
('67', 230, 1, 24, 394721) Vinoba is experimenting with spinning at the rate of nearly nine hours per day at the same time that he is taking his classes.
('67', 230, 1, 25, 394848) His output per hour should be regarded as the standard output per hour entitling the spinner to the standard wage.
('67', 230, 1, 26, 394963) I hope to publish shortly the results of Vinobas labours.
('67', 230, 1, 27, 395021) My scheme presupposes living contact with the spinners life.
('67', 230, 1, 28, 395082) A body that would give an unexpected rise in wages will watch the course of the nickel pieces that may be distributed.
('67', 230, 1, 29, 395201) It will be useless to
('67', 231, 0, 1, 395223) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 232
('67', 231, 1, 2, 395265) raise wages gratuitously if they are to be wasted in drink or extravagant marriage or other feasts.
('67', 231, 1, 3, 395365) The mission of khadi is almost like that of untouchability.
('67', 231, 1, 4, 395425) The so called higher classes have for ages utterly neglected the lower classes with the result that the latter do not know the art of living.
('67', 231, 1, 5, 395567) They think that they are mere hewers of wood and drawers of water.
('67', 231, 1, 6, 395634) The so called upper classes have not escaped the punishment of their misdeeds, for they too do not know the art of living and would perish today if they had no help from the lower classes.
('67', 231, 1, 7, 395823) The mission of khadi is to correct this double evil by inviting the upper classes to [do] penance towards the lower classes.
('67', 231, 1, 8, 395948) Let the village industries workers, too, see to it that the villagers occupied in the various industries organized by them get the minimum wage that may be fixed by the Association.

('67', 231, 3, 10, 396148) 364. ON DIARY WRITING1
('67', 231, 4, 11, 396171) Your diary must contain every particular about your health.
('67', 231, 4, 12, 396231) It must also contain the particulars of work done every hour, if the work could be so divided.
('67', 231, 4, 13, 396326) You might also make it a mirror of your own mind, recording your thoughts and dreams, good and bad, and you must also make it a record of your acts, good and bad.
('67', 231, 4, 14, 396489) This mirror of the self is helpful for a purification of ones self.
('67', 231, 4, 15, 396557) Ones bowels must move regularly in order to keep one in a fit condition.
('67', 231, 4, 16, 396630) That is physical purification.
('67', 231, 4, 17, 396661) Just as this physical purification is necessary for the health of the body, even so spiritual purification is necessary for the health of the soul.
('67', 231, 4, 18, 396809) In fact the necessity for physical cleanliness is in inverse proportion to the necessity for spiritual cleanliness.
('67', 231, 4, 19, 396925) That is to say, spiritual cleanliness means automatic physical cleanliness.
('67', 231, 4, 20, 397001) Have we not heard that a yogis body emits a fragrant smell?
('67', 231, 4, 21, 397061) The fragrant smell means here the absence of bad smell.

('67', 232, 2, 3, 397412) HARIJAN WELLS FUNDS
('67', 232, 3, 4, 397432) This week is published an estimate of wells required in the Province of Delhi for Harijans.
('67', 232, 3, 5, 397524) The reader will note what the wells mean to sweeper class Harijans.
('67', 232, 3, 6, 397592) They are debarred from using even the wells set apart for the other classes of Harijans.
('67', 232, 3, 7, 397681) Of course this is not peculiar to the Delhi Province.
('67', 232, 3, 8, 397735) The reiteration of the grievance emphasizes the importance of this special charity.
('67', 232, 3, 9, 397819) I hope that the heads of provincial Sanghs will make local collections which may be earmarked for use in their own provinces to the extent required.
('67', 232, 4, 10, 397968) TAMIL HOLY BOOK
('67', 232, 5, 11, 397984) Thiruvalluvar was a Tamil Saint.
('67', 232, 5, 12, 398017) Tradition says that he was a Harijan weaver.
('67', 232, 5, 13, 398062) He is said to have lived in the first century of the Christian era.
('67', 232, 5, 14, 398130) He gave us the famous Thirukuralholy maxims described by the Tamilians as the Tamil Veda and by M. Ariel as one of the highest and purest expressions of human thought.
('67', 232, 5, 15, 398298) The maxims number 1,330. These have been translated into many languages.
('67', 232, 5, 16, 398371) There are several English translations.
('67', 232, 5, 17, 398411) The late V.V.S. Iyer, who founded the Sharmadevi Ashram for the service of Harijans among others, produced the latest translation.
('67', 232, 5, 18, 398542) He died leaving Sharmadevi and his book to the nation.
('67', 232, 5, 19, 398597) Sharmadevi now belongs to the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('67', 232, 5, 20, 398648) There are about 1,000 copies still left of the second edition of the translation.
('67', 232, 5, 21, 398730) The price of the book was Rs. 5 originally.
('67', 232, 5, 22, 398774) It has now been reduced to Rs. 2/8. The book has a substantial preface written by the translator.
('67', 232, 5, 23, 398872) The proceeds will be utilized for the Harijan service.
('67', 232, 5, 24, 398927) To whet the readers appetite I quote two maxims at random:
('67', 232, 6, 25, 398986) Take not away from any living thing the life that is sweet unto all, even if it be to save thine own.
('67', 232, 6, 26, 399088) Compare Goldsmiths:
('67', 232, 7, 27, 399108) No flocks that range the valley free
('67', 232, 8, 28, 399145) To slaughter I condemn,
('67', 232, 9, 29, 399169) Taught by the Power that pities me
('67', 232, 10, 30, 399204) I learn to pity them.
('67', 232, 10, 31, 399226) The other selection is:
('67', 233, 0, 1, 399250) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 234
('67', 233, 1, 2, 399292) Death is like unto sleep and life is like the waking after that sleep.
('67', 233, 1, 3, 399363) Compare Wordsworths:
('67', 233, 2, 4, 399384) Death is but a sleep and a forgetting.
('67', 233, 2, 5, 399423) The book can be had on application to the Secretary, Tamil Nad Harijan Sevak Sangh, Teppakulam, Trichinopoly.

('67', 233, 5, 8, 399579) WARDHA, June 6, 1935 MY DEAR MARY,
('67', 233, 6, 9, 399614) (Bapu insisted on my calling you by your Christian name when he heard me say that I was going to write to you as Miss Barr!)
('67', 233, 7, 10, 399739) I am writing to you on his behalf.
('67', 233, 7, 11, 399774) He has your letter of the 2nd instant.
('67', 233, 7, 12, 399813) It is his desire that you should not leave Miraj until the doctors have declared you quite cured and fit enough to return to your work.
('67', 233, 7, 13, 399949) He agrees entirely with your planwhen you do returnof returning via Secunderabad, instead of by Poona.
('67', 233, 7, 14, 400052) Bapu feels also that your teeth and eyes should receive the necessary attention from the specialists who have treated you beforeso you must consult them when it is possible for you to do so.
('67', 233, 8, 15, 400243) Regarding Maria Petersens letter Bapu wishes me to say that there is no likelihood of his going to Denmark .

('67', 233, 11, 18, 400406) 367. LETTER TO MANILAL AND SUSHILA GANDHI June 6, 1935
('67', 233, 12, 19, 400461) MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
('67', 233, 13, 20, 400482) I have your letters.
('67', 233, 13, 21, 400503) I understand the difficulty about eradicating malaria.
('67', 233, 13, 22, 400558) The task is certainly difficult if all around the place there are plantations of sugarcane.
('67', 233, 13, 23, 400650) But one thing about mosquitoes is that they do not fly beyond a certain distance.
('67', 233, 13, 24, 400732) I think you are not likely to be affected by plantations situated at a distance of a hundred acres from your place.
('67', 233, 13, 25, 400848) Be that as it may, make sure that no water or moisture collects around the place.
('67', 233, 13, 26, 400930) Since the houses are on top of a hill, there is no possibility, either, of water accumulating around them.
('67', 233, 13, 27, 401037) The food

('67', 234, 1, 2, 401093) should be light.
('67', 234, 1, 3, 401110) You should eat green leaves like salad, etc.
('67', 234, 1, 4, 401155) Constipation should never be ignored.
('67', 234, 1, 5, 401193) Mosquito nets should be used.
('67', 234, 1, 6, 401223) I think with the help of these precautions you can keep off malaria.
('67', 234, 1, 7, 401292) I was surprised to learn that Lakshmi could send khadi made from the yarn spun by me.
('67', 234, 1, 8, 401378) May I take it then that I need not send anything now?
('67', 234, 1, 9, 401432) If you two cannot spare any time to teach Sita, then I should think that there is some big defect somewhere in your life.
('67', 234, 1, 10, 401554) If, willingly or unwillingly, you accept the responsibility of parenthood, then it also becomes your duty to train the childrens body, mind, etc., and you ought to spare some time for that, however busy your life may be.
('67', 234, 1, 11, 401775) Thanks to Gods kindness, children do get some education from parents whether they know it or not.
('67', 234, 1, 12, 401873) Whether you want it or not, your children are bound to imitate your manners and thoughts.
('67', 234, 1, 13, 401963) Even for that reason, parents are obliged to keep their thoughts and actions absolutely pure.
('67', 234, 1, 14, 402057) If your speech is pure, that of your children will be pure.
('67', 234, 1, 15, 402117) If you pray regularly, your children also will do the same.
('67', 234, 1, 16, 402177) Whatever things and in whatever manner you eat, your children will do the same.
('67', 234, 1, 17, 402257) What remains then is instruction in letters.
('67', 234, 1, 18, 402302) How much time can it consume?
('67', 234, 1, 19, 402332) With a little care, you can easily impart that to children while they are playing about.
('67', 234, 1, 20, 402421) But then, there should be a firm determination on your part to impart education to your children yourselves.
('67', 234, 1, 21, 402530) You should first acquire in some measure the knowledge that you want to impart to your children.
('67', 234, 1, 22, 402627) And the result will be that your children will get valuable knowlege in the normal course of their daily life, such as they can never get in schools.
('67', 234, 1, 23, 402777) If you spend your time in this way instead of in idle gossip, then you will increase your knowledge also and, what is more, your whole life will become more disciplined.
('67', 234, 1, 24, 402947) Forget Sorabji and his conduct.
('67', 234, 1, 25, 402979) If you try to understand the affair about halwa, you will find it amusing.
('67', 234, 1, 26, 403054) You should learn to get entertainment even from such malicious stories.
('67', 234, 1, 27, 403126) Harilal seems to have gone off the rails once again 1. Maybe he had never returned to the rails and was merely pretending reformation when he came here.
('67', 234, 1, 28, 403279) But, instead of levelling such a serious charge against him, assume that he has now gone off the rails.
('67', 234, 1, 29, 403383) This is only my suspicion as yet.
('67', 234, 1, 30, 403417) I do not know what the truth is.
('67', 234, 1, 31, 403450) It will be known in a few days.

('67', 235, 2, 3, 403708) July 6, 1935 CHI.
('67', 235, 2, 4, 403726) LILAVATI, I got your very strange and sad letter.
('67', 235, 2, 5, 403776) Only two days ago I had from you a letter full of hope, which gave me an impression that you were now completely composed.
('67', 235, 2, 6, 403899) But todays letter seems to have been written by another Lilavati as it were.
('67', 235, 2, 7, 403976) How did such a profound change take place in just two days time?
('67', 235, 2, 8, 404041) You are staying in Rajkot of your own free will.
('67', 235, 2, 9, 404090) I had even suggested that you might study in Bombay.
('67', 235, 2, 10, 404143) It has always been my wish that you should not overstrain yourself.
('67', 235, 2, 11, 404211) What has happend all at once to fill you with such profound despair?
('67', 235, 2, 12, 404280) If you find the atmosphere there full of selfishness, it will hardly be different anywhere else.
('67', 235, 2, 13, 404377) It is in your hands to create and preserve the atmosphere that you desire.
('67', 235, 2, 14, 404452) Have patience and be calm.
('67', 235, 2, 15, 404479) But if your patience and endurance are exhausted, leave Rajkot by all means.
('67', 235, 2, 16, 404556) You are entirely free.
('67', 235, 2, 17, 404579) The relationship with me does not clip anybodys wings.
('67', 235, 2, 18, 404634) On the contrary, it gives fresh wings to a person if he has none.
('67', 235, 2, 19, 404700) Hence, you can fly wherever you want to.
('67', 235, 2, 20, 404741) Whether you can stay with me here is a different question altogether.
('67', 235, 2, 21, 404811) We shall think over it if an opportunity occurs.
('67', 235, 2, 22, 404860) Do not ever give up Narandass protection.
('67', 235, 2, 23, 404902) You will repent if you do that.
('67', 235, 2, 24, 404934) I cannot suggest a better guide for you than he is.

('67', 235, 3, 28, 405205) What has happened to Lilavati?
('67', 235, 3, 29, 405236) She is extremely agitated.
('67', 235, 3, 30, 405263) She is a good girl, but one can never be sure when she will let one down.

('67', 236, 2, 4, 405696) Whatever one might think, it is in india we shall find our happiness in the poor comforts of our huts.
('67', 236, 2, 5, 405799) Can we ever be happy by going abroad?
('67', 236, 2, 6, 405837) I am glad that you read the Harijan story twice despite your worries.
('67', 236, 2, 7, 405907) Dont mind what happens now.
('67', 236, 2, 8, 405935) I hope you are taking care of your health.
('67', 236, 2, 9, 405978) Worrying wont solve this problem.
('67', 236, 2, 10, 406012) Dont you know that Ramabehn 1 is by your side?
('67', 236, 2, 11, 406059) I wanted to write this last sentence differently but wrote it thus.
('67', 236, 2, 12, 406127) But since it is apt, I am not revising it.
('67', 236, 2, 13, 406170) She is a sort of a philosopher, but just as we do not know God who is very near us, we often do not know the friend who gives us real solace.
('67', 236, 2, 14, 406312) Hence, if you do not feel reassured in her presence, I have suggested in the sentence above that you have no cause for worry so long as she is with you.
('67', 236, 2, 15, 406465) She is the right person to bear the burden of your suffering.

('67', 236, 5, 20, 406767) Can we compel him to be virtuous?
('67', 236, 5, 21, 406801) It, therefore, seems to me that you need do nothing except pass his letters to me and mine to him.
('67', 236, 5, 22, 406900) You may see what you can do when he repents again.
('67', 236, 5, 23, 406951) Kanu 2 recovered from fever long ago.
('67', 236, 5, 24, 406989) Please rest assured that he is perfectly at ease here.
('67', 236, 5, 25, 407044) Neither you nor Jamna nor Purushottam need worry in the least about him.

('67', 237, 3, 4, 407403) These are the remains of the paper sent to you.
('67', 237, 3, 5, 407451) Never believe what the papers say of me unless you have confirmation from here.
('67', 237, 3, 6, 407531) I did howl from pain for 45 minutes.
('67', 237, 3, 7, 407568) When it was over, there was no weakness felt, no weight lost.
('67', 237, 3, 8, 407630) It was an overdose of neem leaf.
('67', 237, 3, 9, 407663) I was trying its maximum capacity.
('67', 237, 3, 10, 407698) Such experiments must be tried on self.
('67', 237, 3, 11, 407738) My experiments have never done permanent harm.
('67', 237, 3, 12, 407785) I have made rich discoveries for myself and companions.
('67', 237, 3, 13, 407841) In the early days my teeth suffered.
('67', 237, 3, 14, 407878) But there too, there was nothing wrong with the experiment.
('67', 237, 3, 15, 407938) It was my ignorance of early days.
('67', 237, 3, 16, 407973) If our doctors knew the properties of indigenous foods and drugs, the way of persons like me would be simple and easy.
('67', 237, 3, 17, 408092) I shall have more paper made for you.
('67', 237, 3, 18, 408130) Believe me, I am quite fit.

('67', 237, 7, 26, 408345) Your article is good, but it should be in Hindi.
('67', 237, 7, 27, 408394) The English version should be as its translation.
('67', 237, 7, 28, 408444) If this is not done, you will be making a wrong beginning.
('67', 237, 7, 29, 408503) The writers in the North will not tolerate English.
('67', 237, 7, 30, 408555) Have you made it clear that the monthly 1 will be printed in Hindi?
('67', 237, 7, 31, 408623) I hope articles in other languages also will be printed in the Devanagari script.
('67', 237, 7, 32, 408705) If I am right in this assumption, you should make the point clear in your article.
('67', 237, 7, 33, 408788) I like the idea of an advisory board.
('67', 237, 7, 34, 408826) If I am to be the president in my official capacity, then there is no question of accepting or declining.

('67', 238, 1, 4, 409095) I like to remain within my sphere.
('67', 238, 1, 5, 409130) If it is possible to elect a new President, Vidhu Shekhar Shastri of Santiniketan or Shri Joshi of Karve University will deserve the honour.
('67', 238, 1, 6, 409271) I hear that the latter is a great scholar.
('67', 238, 1, 7, 409314) I do not know him personally.
('67', 238, 1, 8, 409344) Think over this suggestion objectively.
('67', 238, 1, 9, 409384) My hesitation does not spring in the least from false modesty.
('67', 238, 1, 10, 409447) My literary ability is practically nil.
('67', 238, 1, 11, 409487) Being gifted with common sense, I can make good use of whatever little ability I have.
('67', 238, 1, 12, 409574) After you send me the brochure, I will write a brief Foreword 1 for it.
('67', 238, 1, 13, 409646) For the present, I would like to see the advertisements.
('67', 238, 1, 14, 409703) We shall think of some restrictions by and by.
('67', 238, 1, 15, 409750) Personally, I would be for accepting advertisements only of books, education, etc.
('67', 238, 1, 16, 409833) What connection can a purely literary paper have with soap or hand made stick?
('67', 238, 1, 17, 409912) or khadi?
('67', 238, 1, 18, 409922) Advertisements of hand made pens or paper or pictures would be all right.
('67', 238, 1, 19, 409996) We may freely accept advertisements of foreign books.
('67', 238, 1, 20, 410050) But I donot insist on my own views prevailing in this matter.
('67', 238, 1, 21, 410112) We shall have whatever restrictions I can persuade you to accept.

('67', 239, 4, 7, 411001) He wants me to advise him as to the course he should take.
('67', 239, 4, 8, 411060) Regard being had as to his precarious health, I have advised that it would be better if he could reconcile himself to some Harijan service against .

('67', 239, 4, 10, 411239) The other alternative is to take up a business line.
('67', 239, 4, 11, 411292) I see difficulties in his taking it up.
('67', 239, 4, 12, 411332) He must then attend regular hours and be prepared to do best work which is fatal for a man who is in perpetual fear of developing active T.B. But I told him that he should take your advice and be guided by you.
('67', 239, 4, 13, 411543) He tells me he has already written to you.
('67', 239, 4, 14, 411586) I know he will receive your reply in due course.

('67', 239, 11, 24, 411898) I got your letter.
('67', 239, 11, 25, 411917) I had in fact washed my hands of him 2 after I got his last letter.
('67', 239, 11, 26, 411985) I fear that he had started drinking from the very beginning.
('67', 239, 11, 27, 412046) The day he had sought my permission to take brandy as medicine for malaria, I had concluded that he had started drinking again.
('67', 239, 11, 28, 412174) Hence there is no question of my being shocked at all.

('67', 240, 1, 3, 412415) You certainly did well in not sending a wire.

('67', 240, 7, 13, 412778) What had upset you?
('67', 240, 7, 14, 412798) You would not be so easily upset if you dont do anything against your nature.

('67', 241, 8, 14, 413679) How is it possible for me to keep aloof from the Barkamta affair?
('67', 241, 8, 15, 413745) If the Charkha Sangh receives any complaint regarding khadi the matter perforce has to be cleared up.
('67', 241, 8, 16, 413847) Shankerlal is ill and he is moreover upset over this dispute.
('67', 241, 8, 17, 413909) Therefore he has referred it to me.
('67', 241, 8, 18, 413945) Annadas letters too are pouring in.
('67', 241, 8, 19, 413981) So the matter has to be settled one way or the other.
('67', 241, 8, 20, 414035) In my opinion you and Annada should both make your statements.
('67', 241, 8, 21, 414098) Next, each of you should answer the others allegation.
('67', 241, 8, 22, 414153) If, after that, there is need for you two to be called, I shall send for you.
('67', 241, 8, 23, 414231) Otherwise I shall simply give my award.
('67', 241, 8, 24, 414271) Isnt this quite the right thing?
('67', 241, 8, 25, 414304) As regards bones I appreciate the process adopted in Indore.
('67', 241, 9, 26, 414365) Some nitrogen is of course wasted.
('67', 241, 9, 27, 414400) But does it matter?
('67', 241, 9, 28, 414420) If the bones are fired carefully they can be easily ground in an ordinary mill.
('67', 241, 9, 29, 414500) Hundreds of maunds of it can be ground to powder in the lime grinding mill and this manure will be marketable.

('67', 242, 11, 21, 415530) Do you know what staying with me means?
('67', 242, 11, 22, 415570) It means living like a labourer, learning whatever you can while labouring and eating whatever food you are given.
('67', 242, 11, 23, 415685) If you can be satisfied with this, then come.
('67', 242, 11, 24, 415731) You wont have a separate room here.
('67', 242, 11, 25, 415767) This manner of living is difficult for me, for Ba, and would be so for everybody.

('67', 244, 4, 6, 417378) If I had not read it I could not have understood your mind.
('67', 244, 4, 7, 417438) Your letter expresses anger, agitation and pride.
('67', 244, 4, 8, 417488) To assert that men controlling the Charkha Sangh have spoilt it all, that the Pratishthan alone has accomplished everything, yet has had to suffer all hardships and that Annada and others bear animosity is not correct and it proceeds from pride.
('67', 244, 4, 9, 417734) Regarding all this I shall not answer through a letter.

('67', 244, 9, 18, 418205) It is indeed swadeshi cloth for you, but not the cloth that you should go in for in India.
('67', 244, 9, 19, 418296) In Rome do as the Romans do is not a meaningless saying.
('67', 244, 9, 20, 418353) We must try to observe the manners and customs of the country whose salt we eat.
('67', 244, 9, 21, 418434) When I was in Africa, I tried to use as many things as I could, made by African hands.
('67', 244, 9, 22, 418521) So unless you have any special objection, I would ask you to use khadi, Khadi is no doubt dearer, but then you may try to do with less cloth than you need.

('67', 245, 2, 3, 418997) There is an eternal struggle going on in us between the powers of light and powers of darkness, those of truth and of untruth, between God and the Devil.
('67', 245, 2, 4, 419151) We have to carry on the struggle as best as we may, but we have always to be conscious of our limitations.
('67', 245, 2, 5, 419258) Arjuna was on the point of forgetting his limitations and Lord Krishna prevented him from doing so.
('67', 245, 2, 6, 419358) Ahimsa is the law of life, but if I have not shed the fear of serpents what am I to do?
('67', 245, 2, 7, 419446) My mind has already killed the serpent, only the flesh is weak.
('67', 245, 2, 8, 419510) Your duty says: Kill it.
('67', 245, 2, 9, 419535) Give up the vain attempt of refraining from killing it. The same is the case about brahmacharya and grihasthashrama.
('67', 245, 2, 10, 419652) Lifelong brahmacharya is a consummation devoutly to be wished, but he who cannot control his passions, whose mind and sense lust after the flesh, must enter grihasthashrama and a pure householders life.
('67', 245, 2, 11, 419855) For him the attempt at lifelong brahmacharya is vain.
('67', 245, 2, 12, 419909) He will not give up his faith in the ideal, but he will approach it by gradual practice in self restraint.

('67', 245, 5, 15, 420066) I gladly publish the foregoing 2. I am asking Lala Mohanlal, the Secretary of the Punjab Harijan Sevak Sangh, to deal with the letter.
('67', 245, 5, 16, 420201) All the needs of Harijans in the matter of wells that come under the observation of the local Sangh will certainly be brought to the notice of the Punjab Sanitary Board.
('67', 245, 5, 17, 420371) The Harijan Sevak Sanghs policy is not to duplicate the work done by the Government but wherever
('67', 245, 6, 18, 420468) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had explained: In a recent article entitled All Life Is One , 22 6 1935Gandhiji answered all questions directed at some of the seeming contradictions between his belief and action.
('67', 245, 6, 19, 420710) In reply to similar questions addressed to him privately he sent a reply [presumably Letter to Krishnachandra, 3 7 1935 which makes his position and those of aspirants clearer, if possible. 2 This was a letter dated June 28, 1935, from K. A. Rahman, Secretary, Sanitary Board, Punjab, not reproduced here.
('67', 245, 6, 20, 421016) The addressee, who had read an article about drinking water for Harijans in the Punjab in Civil and Military Gazette, dated June 27, 1935, had pointed out that in recent years lakhs of rupees have been spent in providing good drinking water for villagers and that there was no distinction between Harijans and non Harijans.

('67', 246, 1, 3, 421414) The Sangh is building wells only where necessity is proved.
('67', 246, 1, 4, 421474) I may mention here, that though in law everywhere in British India public wells are open to Harijans in common with the others, in practice it has been found that Harijans are forcibly debarred from their use by caste Hindus and sometimes even others.
('67', 246, 1, 5, 421726) Harijans dare not use these wells without inviting severe corporal punishment from caste Hindus.

('67', 246, 4, 9, 421948) The following questionnaire to its agents and others has been issued by the A.I.V.I.A. 1, the answers to reach the Central Office, Wardha, before 1st August next:
('67', 246, 5, 10, 422111) It has been proposed that we should insist on the village artisan getting an adequate return for his labour in connection with all articles produced or sold under the aegis of the A.I.V.I.A. For this purpose it will be necessary to fix a working wage standard.
('67', 246, 5, 11, 422372) Such standard should be the same for either sex for equal quantity of work.
('67', 246, 5, 12, 422448) It may be based on an eight hour day with a prescribed minimum output.
('67', 246, 5, 13, 422519) Such wage will enter into the cost and the price should be fixed in relation to this.
('67', 246, 5, 14, 422605) Ordinarily we may not be able to fix the prices in the competitive market, but we may do so for articles which do not enter into competition and for goods chosen for their special virtues which are appreciated by the consumers.
('67', 246, 6, 15, 422833) This questionnaire is sent out to inivite your opinion on the following points:
('67', 246, 7, 16, 422913) 1. Do you think it feasible to fix a minimum daily wage and ensure it to the workers by fixing prices?
('67', 246, 8, 17, 423016) 2. Should we fix our ultimate standard and work up towards it, or should we start with a low minimum and then raise it as we proceed?
('67', 246, 9, 18, 423150) 3. On what basis should it be arrived at?
('67', 246, 9, 19, 423192) Can you suggest a subsistence wage taking into consideration only food for the time being, as clothing should be made by personal effort?
('67', 246, 9, 20, 423330) Will half an anna per hour be too low?
('67', 246, 9, 21, 423369) Associations like the A.I.S.A. 2, and the A.I.V.I.A., and such philanthropic institutions may not follow the commercial maxim of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest.
('67', 246, 9, 22, 423556) The A.I.S.A. has certainly tried to buy in the cheapest market.

('67', 247, 1, 5, 423991) It has already been discovered that the tendency among agents is to produce the required articles at as low prices as possible.
('67', 247, 1, 6, 424119) Where may the axe be laid if not upon the artisans earnings?
('67', 247, 1, 7, 424180) Unless, therefore, a minimum rate be fixed, there is every danger of the village artisan suffering, though it is for his sake that the A.I.V.I.A. has been brought into being.
('67', 247, 1, 8, 424355) We have exploited the poor patient villagers for too long.
('67', 247, 1, 9, 424414) Let not A.I.V.I.A. intensify the exploitation under the guise of philanthropy.
('67', 247, 1, 10, 424493) Its aim is not to produce village articles as cheap as possible; it is to provide the workless villagers with work at a living wage.
('67', 247, 1, 11, 424626) It has been argued that anything that may raise the prices of articles made in the villages will defeat the purpose for which the A.I.V.I.A. has been brought into being, for, it is said, nobody will buy the village articles if the prices are too high.
('67', 247, 1, 12, 424878) Why should the price of an article be considered too high, if it only provides a living wage for the manufacturer?
('67', 247, 1, 13, 424993) The buying public has to be instructed to know the abject condition of the people.
('67', 247, 1, 14, 425076) If we are to do justice to the toiling millions we must render to them their due; we must pay them a wage that will sustain them; we must not take advantage of their helplessness and pay wage that would hardly give them one full meal.
('67', 247, 1, 15, 425311) It is quite clear that the Association must refuse to compete with mill manufactures.
('67', 247, 1, 16, 425397) We may not take part in a game in which we know we must lose.
('67', 247, 1, 17, 425459) In terms of metal, the big combines, whether foreign or indigenous, will always be able to outbid the effort of the human hand.
('67', 247, 1, 18, 425587) What the Association seeks to do is to substitute false and non human economics by the true and human.
('67', 247, 1, 19, 425690) Not killing competition, but life giving co operation, is the law of the human being.
('67', 247, 1, 20, 425776) Ignoring the emotion is to forget that man has feelings.
('67', 247, 1, 21, 425833) Not the good of the few, not even the good of the many, but it is the good of all that we are made to promote, if we are made in His own image.
('67', 247, 1, 22, 425977) A philanthropic body like the A.I.V.I.A. cannot shirk a consideration of the problems involved in the questionnaire.
('67', 247, 2, 23, 426094) 1 Vide the following item.

('67', 248, 1, 2, 426168) true solution appears to be impracticable, it must be its endeavour to make it practicable.
('67', 248, 1, 3, 426260) Truth is ever practicable.
('67', 248, 1, 4, 426287) Thus considered the programme of the Association may fittingly be called adult education.
('67', 248, 1, 5, 426377) And if the Association is to secure for the artisan under its care a living wage, it must also pry into his domestic budget, and trace the course of every coin that is paid.
('67', 248, 1, 6, 426551) The most difficult question to determine would be the minimum of the living wage.
('67', 248, 1, 7, 426633) I have suggested eight annas for eight hours strenuous labour converted into a given quantity of the particular goods turned out by an artisan of good ability.
('67', 248, 1, 8, 426793) Eight annas is a mere token representing a certain quantity of necessaries of life.
('67', 248, 1, 9, 426877) If in a family of five there are two full workers they would earn at the proposed rate Rs. 30 per month allowing no holiday and no sickness gap.
('67', 248, 1, 10, 427022) Thirty rupees per month is no extravagant income for five mouths.
('67', 248, 1, 11, 427088) The method here proposed necessarily ignores the distinction of sex or age.
('67', 248, 1, 12, 427164) But every referee will draw upon his own personal experience and report accordingly.

('67', 249, 1, 2, 427310) 389. ALL INDIA SPINNERS ASSOCIATION
('67', 249, 2, 3, 427346) What is true of the artisans working through the A.I.V.I.A., is equally true of those who are working through the A.I.S.A. Only the A.I.V.I.A. has to write on a clean slate.
('67', 249, 2, 4, 427520) The A.I.S.A. has to undo a tradition of fifteen years standing if it has to introduce a uniform minimum.
('67', 249, 2, 5, 427625) In helping the numerous spinners, it has also to deal with weavers, one tenth of the number of spinners, besides carders, ginners and others.
('67', 249, 2, 6, 427767) The wages of each class vary.
('67', 249, 2, 7, 427797) The difference between those earned by weavers and those earned by spinners would appear to be too great to admit of equality.
('67', 249, 2, 8, 427924) Whereas a spinner gets two pies per hour, a weaver gets one anna at the lowest and not unoften two.
('67', 249, 2, 9, 428024) To bring the spinners to 12 pies from two is a very big problem, especially when it is remembered that they number nearly one lac and half.
('67', 249, 2, 10, 428164) But the Association to be worthy of its trust has to develop enough courage to do the right thing.
('67', 249, 2, 11, 428263) Difficulties are there to be faced, not to cower us.
('67', 249, 2, 12, 428316) We must trust those who buy khadi for the love of Daridranarayana to pay a higher price for it than they have donehitherto.
('67', 249, 2, 13, 428440) If the trust is misplaced we must face a fall, however big, in sales.
('67', 249, 2, 14, 428510) Those who love khadi will buy it at any cost if they know that ninety five rupees out of one hundred go into the pockets of the Daridranarayana.
('67', 249, 2, 15, 428655) But after all the commercial use of khadi is its secondary and least use.
('67', 249, 2, 16, 428729) Not more than one crore persons, i.e., city people, would need to buy khadi.
('67', 249, 2, 17, 428806) These can be easily and comfortably clothed by twenty lacs of full time artisans.
('67', 249, 2, 18, 428888) The primary use of khadi is to find supplementary employment for the peasantry.
('67', 249, 2, 19, 428968) They have to be taught to spin their own yarn and even weave it themselves or have it woven.
('67', 249, 2, 20, 429061) They become their producers and buyers or rather users even as they are their own cooks and eaters.
('67', 249, 2, 21, 429161) This work we have hardly touched seriously as yet.
('67', 249, 2, 22, 429212) Shri Banker is quietly and slowly organizing the change.
('67', 249, 2, 23, 429269) Whilst that is being done, it is as well to set ourselves right by the spinners by offering them an adequate wage.
('67', 249, 2, 24, 429384) Is it to be eight annas per day or less?
('67', 249, 2, 25, 429425) Whatever the limit, what is to be the quantity of yarn expected in one hour to qualify the spinner to receive the given wage?
('67', 249, 2, 26, 429551) The same question has to be solved for ginners, carders, weavers and all those who are today working in the manufacture of khadi.
('67', 250, 0, 1, 429681) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 251
('67', 250, 1, 2, 429729) Will those who are interested in khadi and are at all conversant with the science favour me with their views on the proposed change in the scale of wages?
('67', 250, 1, 3, 429884) If they favour the change, they will also say what minimum they will fix.

('67', 250, 4, 6, 429997) Kumarappa sends me the following for publication:
('67', 250, 5, 7, 430047) The ordinary members are reminded that they are required to send in their reports to the Secretary regularly every quarter under the Bye Law No.
('67', 250, 5, 8, 430192) 11 which reads as follows:
('67', 250, 6, 9, 430219) Every ordinary member of the Association shall send to the Secretary a report of the work done by him every quarter so as to reach the Central Office not later than one month after the expiry of the quarter.
('67', 250, 6, 10, 430427) If no report is received for three consecutive quarters from any ordinary member, such member shall cease to be a member of the Association.
('67', 250, 7, 11, 430568) Such ordinary members as have not sent in their reports hitherto are requested to submit an account of their work done up to 30th June, 1935 without further delay.
('67', 250, 7, 12, 430732) Kumarappa is a vigilant Secretary and so is the Chairman Sjt.
('67', 250, 7, 13, 430794) Jajooji.
('67', 250, 7, 14, 430803) They both believe that the rules of an institution should be enforced or repealed.
('67', 250, 7, 15, 430886) As there is no likelihood of the above reasonable rule being repealed, it is to be hoped that the members will carry out the rule both in the spirit and to the letter.

('67', 250, 12, 20, 431147) I welcomed your letter.
('67', 250, 12, 21, 431171) I had thought that Narandas and you were now getting along well with each other.
('67', 250, 12, 22, 431252) But I see that I was mistaken.
('67', 250, 12, 23, 431283) I was very glad that you wrote frankly.
('67', 250, 12, 24, 431323) I have received a letter regarding the school there.
('67', 250, 12, 25, 431376) I am inquiring into the matter.
('67', 250, 12, 26, 431408) Have you told Narandas what you think?
('67', 250, 12, 27, 431447) I see from your letter that you are inclined to sympathize with the teachers who have left.

('67', 251, 1, 4, 431666) Bapa 1 tells me in his letter that there is complete understanding now between Jivanlal and you.
('67', 251, 1, 5, 431763) Your letter raises a doubt in my mind.

('67', 251, 6, 11, 431930) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS,
('67', 251, 7, 12, 431949) I have your long letter; it is good and I notice nothing wrong in it.
('67', 251, 7, 13, 432019) Nevertheless I have grave apprehension that things will fizzle out if any conditions are laid down such as release of the prisoners and detenus, abolition of deportation to the Andamans, restoration of the satyagrahis lands.
('67', 251, 7, 14, 432244) It might be considered improper at this juncture.These suggestions may well come from a person invited for consultations.
('67', 251, 7, 15, 432366) If the present atmosphere continues, I see no hope of an agreement.
('67', 251, 7, 16, 432434) All their amiable talk with you seems to have an underlying implication that only the existing state of things will be accepted.
('67', 251, 7, 17, 432563) If the fear is not groundless it is impossible to reach an agreement; I can do nothing more at present.
('67', 251, 7, 18, 432667) But it does not mean that you should give up the efforts you are making.
('67', 251, 7, 19, 432740) You should go ahead with your endeavour; the outcome lies only with God.
('67', 251, 7, 20, 432813) You are keeping well, I hope.

('67', 254, 9, 11, 435336) 1. When have means to get we can in many cases use get; e.g., I must have it or I must get it. 2. There is very little difference between must and have.
('67', 254, 9, 12, 435489) 3. We can say either If you had done this or Had you done this, i.e., if we use had in the place of if the meaning remains unchanged.
('67', 254, 9, 13, 435623) You will understand this better when you use it.
('67', 254, 9, 14, 435672) 4. The article a must be used before a noun denoting countable things.
('67', 254, 9, 15, 435743) A is taken to mean as one, therefore the is used for the plural.
('67', 254, 9, 16, 435808) Where that is used, we can use the; e.g., The or that man whom you know is here. If there are more persons, then The or those men whom you know are here. You must have calmed down now.

('67', 259, 11, 17, 442245) [Before July 20, 1935]
('67', 259, 12, 18, 442268) I rarely say anything on the occasion of the departure of our visitors, but I do so today, first, because he is a visitor from Japan, but secondly and principally, because of the noble example he has set to us all by the way in which he lived in our midst.
('67', 259, 12, 19, 442525) 3 He has been with us for four or five months, but no one has worked with such devotion to his task and in such self abnegation.
('67', 259, 12, 20, 442654) He has worked away so mutely that we rarely noticed his presence.
('67', 259, 12, 21, 442720) His absorption in his prayers was a thing to charm anyone.

('67', 260, 1, 2, 443066) four hours in the day, not in a haphazard or perfunctory way, but with zest, devotion and concentration is an extraordinary thing.
('67', 260, 1, 3, 443197) Knowing no language of India and not even English, he must have found himself an utter stranger in our midst when he came.
('67', 260, 1, 4, 443320) But stranger he would be none.
('67', 260, 1, 5, 443351) He began the study of Hindi and learnt it soon enough to be able to speak with us somewhat.
('67', 260, 1, 6, 443443) But what I prize most is the radiance of his joy all the days he has been with us.
('67', 260, 1, 7, 443526) Fancy yourself in a strange land where you know no one, where everything, including the language, manners, customs, is strange, and ask yourself if you can live as this friend has lived in the midst of us.
('67', 260, 1, 8, 443732) I fancy I could not do so, nor can any one of you.
('67', 260, 1, 9, 443783) He derived his joy from the inner self, I should say.
('67', 260, 1, 10, 443837) For I am sure the sourroundings in the midst of which he found himself were no source of such joy for him.
('67', 260, 1, 11, 443944) None of us has ever seen him ruffled, ever sour or bitter.
('67', 260, 1, 12, 444003) His presence everywhere radiated joy which we prize.
('67', 260, 1, 13, 444056) That is why we will all miss him.

('67', 260, 4, 18, 444359) These absorb dirt and dust and perspiration as nothing else can, and because they afford a comfortable seat you sit on them as a matter of course.
('67', 260, 4, 19, 444506) These seats are or can be washed daily and you could clean them yourself as often as you like.

('67', 260, 9, 25, 444851) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had reported that Gandhiji made these remarks during his talk with a friend who had never travelled third class but wanted to do so against the protests of his friends and relations because one could never improve the lot of third class passengers except by travelling with them.

('67', 261, 1, 2, 445234) does, would you be so good as to explain how you reconcile the view here expressed with your more usual statements?
('67', 261, 1, 3, 445350) It seems to me the most dangerous doctrine yet recorded.
('67', 261, 1, 4, 445407) It invites anyone to take law into his own hands, and do murder or other violence, on the sole pretext that he is afraid, or that the only alternative to violence is a cowardice that is worse.
('67', 261, 1, 5, 445600) Hurrah for General Dyer, in that case!
('67', 261, 2, 6, 445639) The following is the cutting from the Madras Mail dated 7th instant:
('67', 261, 3, 7, 445708) Replying to a letter from a prominent Congressman, who had described the Hindu Muslim tension in a village in Andhradesha and the reported aggressive attitude exhibited by Muslims of the village, and who sought his advice in the circumstances, Mr. Gandhi in a private communication, says:
('67', 261, 4, 8, 445997) DEAR FRIEND,
('67', 261, 5, 9, 446010) The condition described by hyou is regrettable.
('67', 261, 5, 10, 446058) If the people fear their Muslim brethren they have every right to defend themselves by physical resistance.
('67', 261, 6, 11, 446166) Not to do so will be cowardice which can in no way be described as non violence.
('67', 261, 6, 12, 446247) Cowardice is a species of violence worse than open and armed violence.
('67', 261, 7, 13, 446318) Though I have no copy of my letter, what is claimed to be a reproduction of it substantially represents my views.
('67', 261, 7, 14, 446432) I cannot recall the name of my correspondent.
('67', 261, 7, 15, 446478) He is unknown to me.
('67', 261, 7, 16, 446499) If he is a prominent Congressman, I fancy, I would know him.
('67', 261, 7, 17, 446560) As stated by the Madras Mail correspondent, my letter was a private communication in reply to an enquiry.
('67', 261, 7, 18, 446666) My reply should, therefore, be read together with the circumstances which prompted it.
('67', 261, 7, 19, 446753) If I had preserved the letter, I would have reproduced the main contents.
('67', 261, 7, 20, 446827) It was a long letter.
('67', 261, 7, 21, 446849) The writer gave in detail the condition of the villagers.
('67', 261, 7, 22, 446907) The Hindu inhabitants were described as helpless and panic stricken.
('67', 261, 7, 23, 446976) They knew nothing of non violence.
('67', 261, 7, 24, 447011) The writer wanted to know what the villagers so situated were to do in the face of daily increasing violence on the part of the Muslims of the village supported by others coming from other villages.
('67', 261, 7, 25, 447210) The advice I gave has been the advice I have always given in such circumstances.
('67', 261, 7, 26, 447291) When I was travelling with the Ali Brothers in 1920, wanton acts of violence by the police near Bettiah were reported to have been done.
('67', 261, 7, 27, 447428) I dealt with the matter in a public speech delivered in Bettiah and wrote on it in the columns of Young
('67', 262, 0, 1, 447532) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 263
('67', 262, 1, 2, 447580) India of 15th December 1920. 1 The relevant paragraph from it is reproduced at the end of this article.
('67', 262, 1, 3, 447684) Non violence cannot be taught to a person who fears to die and has no power of resistance.
('67', 262, 1, 4, 447775) A helpless mouse is not non violent because he is always eaten by pussy.
('67', 262, 1, 5, 447848) He would gladly eat the murderess if he could, but he ever tries to flee from her.
('67', 262, 1, 6, 447931) We do not call him a coward, because he is made by nature to behave no better than he does.
('67', 262, 1, 7, 448023) But a man who, when faced by danger, behaves like a mouse, is rightly called a coward.
('67', 262, 1, 8, 448110) He harbours violence and hatred in his heart and would kill his enemy if he could without being hurt himself.
('67', 262, 1, 9, 448220) He is a stranger to non violence.
('67', 262, 1, 10, 448254) All sermonizing on it will be lost on him.
('67', 262, 1, 11, 448297) Bravery is foreign to his nature.
('67', 262, 1, 12, 448331) Before he can understand non violence he has to be taught to stand his ground and even suffer death in the attempt to defend himself against the aggressor who bids fair to overwhelm him.
('67', 262, 1, 13, 448518) To do otherwise would be to confirm his cowardice and take him further away from non violence.
('67', 262, 1, 14, 448613) Whilst I may not actually help anyone to retaliate, I must not let a coward seek shelter behind non violence so called.
('67', 262, 1, 15, 448733) Not knowing the stuff of which non violence is made many have honestly believed that running away from danger every time was a virtue compared to offering resistance especially when it is fraught with danger to ones life.
('67', 262, 1, 16, 448955) As a teacher of non violence I must, so far as it is possible for me, guard against such an unmanly belief.
('67', 262, 1, 17, 449063) Non violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind.
('67', 262, 1, 18, 449126) It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man.
('67', 262, 1, 19, 449215) Destruction is not the law of the humans.
('67', 262, 1, 20, 449257) Man lives freely only by his readiness to die, if need be, at the hands of his brother, never by killing him.
('67', 262, 1, 21, 449367) Every murder or other injury, no matter for what cause, committed or inflicted on another is a crime against humanity.
('67', 262, 1, 22, 449486) But I see quite clearly that this truth about non violence cannot be delivered to the helpless.
('67', 262, 1, 23, 449582) They must be taught to defend themselves.
('67', 262, 1, 24, 449624) The sceptic then argues: You cannot teach non violence to the weak and you dare not take it to the powerful.
('67', 262, 1, 25, 449733) Why not admit that it is a futile creed? The answer is, non violence can be effectively taught only by living it.
('67', 262, 1, 26, 449847) When there is an unmistakable demonstration of its

('67', 263, 0, 1, 450002) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 264
('67', 263, 1, 2, 450044) power and efficacy the weak will shed their weakness and the mighty will quickly realize the valuelessness of might and becoming meek acknowledge the sovereignty of non violence.
('67', 263, 1, 3, 450223) It is my humble effort to show that this is no unattainable goal even in mass action.
('67', 263, 1, 4, 450309) With critics like the English friend, I plead for patience.
('67', 263, 1, 5, 450369) The deduction that the friend draws from my letter to the Andhra correspondent is in my opinion wholly unwarranted.
('67', 263, 1, 6, 450485) Even without the letter to which mine was a reply, it is clear that there would be no occasion to defend oneself when police aid is at hand.
('67', 263, 1, 7, 450626) The police wont, if they are faithful to their trust, allow open aggression or violence.
('67', 263, 1, 8, 450715) Resistance in self defence is allowed in law.
('67', 263, 1, 9, 450761) I was dealing with circumstances which were assumed to be beyond the reach of law or police.
('67', 263, 1, 10, 450854) They punish more often than they prevent, much less detect, crime.
('67', 263, 1, 11, 450921) Self defence, then, is the only honourable course where there is unreadiness for self immolation.
('67', 263, 2, 12, 451019) And in future, if and when such incidents happen, they must be prepared to defend themselves.
('67', 263, 2, 13, 451113) It is better if they can manfully stand persecution and allow themselves to be robbed, instead of hitting in defence of their persons or property.
('67', 263, 2, 14, 451260) That would indeed be their crowning triumph.
('67', 263, 2, 15, 451305) But such forbearance can only be exercised out of strength and not out of weakness.
('67', 263, 2, 16, 451389) Till that power is acquired, they must be prepared to resist the wrongdoer by force.
('67', 263, 2, 17, 451474) Whena policeman comes not to arrest but to molest, he travels beyond his authority.
('67', 263, 2, 18, 451558) The citizen has then the inalienable right of treating him as a robber and dealing with him as such.
('67', 263, 2, 19, 451659) He will therefore use sufficient force to prevent him from robbing.
('67', 263, 2, 20, 451727) He will most decidedly use force in order to defend the honour of his women.
('67', 263, 2, 21, 451804) The doctrine of non violence is not for the weak and the cowardly; it is meant for the brave and the strong.
('67', 263, 2, 22, 451913) The bravest man allows himself to be killed without killing.
('67', 263, 2, 23, 451974) And he desists from killing or injuring, because he knows that it is wrong to injure.
('67', 263, 2, 24, 452060) Not so the villagers of Champaran.
('67', 263, 2, 25, 452095) They flee from the police.
('67', 263, 2, 26, 452122) They would strike and even kill a policemen, if they had no fear of the law.
('67', 263, 2, 27, 452199) They gain no merit of non violence but on the contrary incur the reproach of cowardice and unmanliness; they stand condemned before Government and man.

('67', 266, 3, 4, 454899) I got your letter yesterday.
('67', 266, 3, 5, 454928) It is very good.
('67', 266, 3, 6, 454945) Keep on describing your work in the same way.

('67', 270, 4, 7, 460170) Your decision to maintain an account is quite correct.

('67', 270, 8, 11, 460315) WARDHA, July 9, 1935
('67', 270, 9, 12, 460336) DEAR DR.
('67', 270, 9, 13, 460345) AMBEDKAR,
('67', 270, 10, 14, 460355) As you may know, Rajaram Bhole is with me just now.
('67', 270, 10, 15, 460407) He wants me to advise him as to the course he should take.
('67', 270, 10, 16, 460466) Regard being had as to his precarious health, I have advised that it would be better if he could reconcile himself to some Harijan service against .
('67', 270, 10, 17, 460615) 2 to feed and clothe himself.
('67', 270, 10, 18, 460645) The other alternative is to take up a business line.
('67', 270, 10, 19, 460698) I see difficulties in his taking it up.
('67', 270, 10, 20, 460738) He must then attend regular hours and be prepared to do best work which is fatal for a man who is in perpetual fear of developing active T.B. But I told him that he should take your advice and be guided by you.
('67', 270, 10, 21, 460949) He tells me he has already written to you.
('67', 270, 10, 22, 460992) I know he will receive your reply in due course.
('67', 270, 10, 23, 461041) But I would like you, for my sake, please, to hasten your reply so as to enable me to tell Rajaram what to do.
('67', 270, 11, 24, 461152) Yours sincerely, DR.

('67', 271, 1, 2, 461468) 429. DISCUSSION WITH MARY CHESLEY AND MIRABEHN 1
('67', 271, 2, 3, 461517) [Before July 22, 1935] 2
('67', 271, 3, 4, 461542) GANDHIJI: But why do you object to it?
('67', 271, 4, 5, 461581) MARY CHESLEY: Because it is English.
('67', 271, 5, 6, 461618) G. But why should I not adopt whatever is best in English dress?
('67', 271, 5, 7, 461683) I would not mind doing so, though Englishmen may look with contempt on Indian dress and disdain to adopt any part of it.
('67', 271, 6, 8, 461804) M.C. It is so inartistic.
('67', 271, 6, 9, 461830) The English shorts go ill with the flowing Indian
('67', 271, 7, 10, 461880) shirts.
('67', 271, 8, 11, 461888) G. Then I suppose you would be horrified if I asked people to wear the sola hat.
('67', 271, 9, 12, 461969) Here Mirabehn took up the battle on behalf of the friend and said it would
('67', 271, 10, 13, 462044) certainly shock her.
('67', 271, 10, 14, 462065) The sola hat was most expensive and extremely unportable.
('67', 271, 11, 15, 462123) G. That only shows that the hat you wore when you were in England was a misfit.
('67', 271, 12, 16, 462203) MIRABEHN: No.
('67', 271, 12, 17, 462217) I had the best hats available in those days, but I never liked
('67', 271, 13, 18, 462280) They cramp ones head and give one an ache.
('67', 271, 14, 19, 462323) G. Then perhaps your head was so ill shaped.
('67', 271, 14, 20, 462368) What I do seriously feel is that the sola hat is a good protection from the sun.
('67', 271, 15, 21, 462449) M. I would any day wear an Indian puggree in preference to the hat.
('67', 271, 15, 22, 462517) It does keep
('67', 271, 16, 23, 462530) off the sun as well.
('67', 271, 17, 24, 462551) G. It does not.
('67', 271, 18, 25, 462567) M. Well, well.
('67', 271, 18, 26, 462582) But these shorts are bad.
('67', 271, 18, 27, 462608) Between the loin cloth that you wear
('67', 271, 19, 28, 462645) and the shorts these people wear there is all the difference between heaven and hell.
('67', 271, 20, 29, 462731) Then you will explain why it is so shocking.
('67', 271, 21, 30, 462776) M. Perhaps I am putting it too strongly; I shall say there is all the difference that there is between day and night.

('67', 272, 1, 2, 463251) M.C. But that is not my reason, I simply cant stand this incongruous mixture.
('67', 272, 1, 3, 463329) Your loin cloth is Indian.
('67', 272, 1, 4, 463356) why should they not put on something like that?
('67', 272, 1, 5, 463404) Let it be all Indian or all English.
('67', 272, 2, 6, 463441) G. Then to be all English I must go to a grogshop, too?
('67', 272, 2, 7, 463497) As regards my loin cloth I know that it is far superior to the shorts.
('67', 272, 2, 8, 463568) But if they all adopted it they would be laughed at for trying to look like the Mahatma.
('67', 272, 3, 9, 463657) M. C. But why not wear the lower part of the shirt inside the shorts?
('67', 272, 4, 10, 463727) G. Yes, that is what you do.
('67', 272, 4, 11, 463756) But it is hygienically bad.

('67', 272, 12, 21, 464067) MANILAL AND SUSHILA,
('67', 272, 13, 22, 464088) I got the letters of you both.
('67', 272, 13, 23, 464119) Your letter to Ba has been redirected to her at Delhi.
('67', 272, 13, 24, 464174) She and Manu are there.
('67', 272, 13, 25, 464198) News about Lakshmis delivery is expected in a day or two.
('67', 272, 13, 26, 464256) Ramdas seems to have lost some money recently.
('67', 272, 13, 27, 464303) He will learn only from his own bitter experiences.
('67', 272, 13, 28, 464355) Harilal has gone to the last extreme.
('67', 272, 13, 29, 464393) For the whole day he is found in a drunken state.
('67', 272, 13, 30, 464443) This time he has crossed all limits.
('67', 272, 13, 31, 464480) Narandas and Kusum are in Rajkot.
('67', 272, 13, 32, 464514) Nimu and her children are here.
('67', 272, 13, 33, 464546) They keep fairly good health.
('67', 272, 13, 34, 464576) Jamnalalji has already arrived here.

('67', 273, 1, 3, 464719) This being the season for rain and malaria, everybody has to be careful.
('67', 273, 1, 4, 464792) Fasting has proved to be the most effective medicine.
('67', 273, 1, 5, 464846) Even though it may not work in all cases, it can do no harm either.
('67', 273, 1, 6, 464914) The fast may either be partial or complete.
('67', 273, 1, 7, 464958) In a partial fast protein and starch are avoided.
('67', 273, 1, 8, 465008) Protein is present in milk and dal.
('67', 273, 1, 9, 465044) Starch is found in rice, wheat, potatoes, etc.
('67', 273, 1, 10, 465091) In a partial fast, therefore, juicy fruits and green vegetables can be eaten.
('67', 273, 1, 11, 465169) When there is actual temperature, however, green vegetables, too, cannot be eaten.
('67', 273, 1, 12, 465252) At that time one should take only orange juice or grape juice.

('67', 274, 1, 4, 466000) Who is to blame?
('67', 274, 1, 5, 466017) Insurance companies seem to have come up like mushrooms.

('67', 274, 1, 7, 466099) But what can we do?
('67', 274, 1, 8, 466119) It is too bad that they should cash in on the name of the Congress.

('67', 274, 5, 17, 466615) It is the custom to use them in those senses.
('67', 274, 5, 18, 466661) Such usage is called idiom.
('67', 274, 5, 19, 466689) 3. It will be beneficial to continue the Pathmala exercises for the present.

('67', 274, 7, 25, 467235) Sometimes would is used in the past tense also., Hun Jato is translated as I would go.
('67', 274, 7, 26, 467322) What meaning is to be taken of would in this sentence?
('67', 274, 7, 27, 467377) (3) Shall I continue to translate from Gujarati into English from the sentences given in the Pathmala ?
('67', 274, 7, 28, 467481) Can you send me a small English paragraph for translation ?

('67', 275, 4, 9, 467914) But dont send him just now if his cough still troubles him.

('67', 275, 11, 19, 468322) I have read your long letter to Mira.
('67', 275, 11, 20, 468360) If the Indian merchant has not come to you it shows that he is not interested in your work.
('67', 275, 11, 21, 468452) You need not write to Bhulabhai Desai.
('67', 275, 11, 22, 468491) I shall try to know from him his intentions.
('67', 275, 11, 23, 468536) Do not expect anything from Prof.
('67', 275, 11, 24, 468570) He can hardly help.
('67', 275, 11, 25, 468590) My firm advice is: Do not on any account incur debts; if you cannot pay, you may cease publication.
('67', 275, 11, 26, 468690) 1 Do not depend upon Indian aid, save in the way of being supplied with news and literature.
('67', 275, 11, 27, 468783) If there are not enough French men of means who can shoulder the little burden, you should close the venture, and rely upon your own personal labour.
('67', 275, 11, 28, 468933) God expects the impossible from none.
('67', 275, 11, 29, 468971) Whatever you do, do for His sake and in His name.
('67', 275, 11, 30, 469021) Then He is responsible and not you for anything you may do.

('67', 277, 2, 3, 470570) BHAISHRI MUNSHI, I got your letter and the other things.
('67', 277, 2, 4, 470627) I am not too pleased with your list of advertisements.
('67', 277, 2, 5, 470682) Our approaches are altogether different.
('67', 277, 2, 6, 470723) I wont go into details.
('67', 277, 2, 7, 470747) If I could convince you, I would have you accept only advertisements for books.
('67', 277, 2, 8, 470827) But I have no right to interfere thus in the affairs of this monthly.
('67', 277, 2, 9, 470897) I will therefore, say only this: Exercise as much restraint as you can.
('67', 277, 3, 10, 470969) I see from your letter to Gurudev that you have given up the idea of an advisory board.
('67', 277, 3, 11, 471057) If that is true, I like it.
('67', 277, 3, 12, 471085) So far as I understand Bhulabhais advice 2 about Indian States, it applies to the relations of the States with the Government and not with their subjects.
('67', 277, 3, 13, 471240) If my belief is correct, then I see nothing wrong in Bhulabhais opinion.
('67', 277, 3, 14, 471313) I think his view is subtle, but sound.
('67', 277, 3, 15, 471352) The relation between Indian States and their subjects and the subjects of British India is a separate issue and was not before Bhulabhai.
('67', 277, 3, 16, 471490) I have held this opinion from the time Bhulabhais advice was first mentioned in the papers.
('67', 277, 3, 17, 471582) I see no contradiction between this and the Congress policy.
('67', 277, 3, 18, 471643) The subjects of Indian States have to demand their rights from the Rulers of the States and not from the British Government.
('67', 277, 3, 19, 471768) The letter to Gurudev will be posted soon.
('67', 277, 3, 20, 471811) Mahadev will write it.

('67', 277, 6, 24, 472012) I have gone through the newspapers and I find much exaggeration in them.

('67', 278, 3, 4, 472544) KAMALNAYAN,
('67', 278, 4, 5, 472556) I got your frank letter.
('67', 278, 4, 6, 472581) It is indeed good that you acknowledge your shortcomings.
('67', 278, 4, 7, 472639) Now proceed one step further and strive hard to get rid of them.
('67', 278, 4, 8, 472704) You can note the ablutions, etc., in your diary and certainly say your prayers twice a day.
('67', 278, 4, 9, 472796) And of course there is Ramadhun.
('67', 278, 4, 10, 472829) The best way to overcome lethargy is to meticulously chalk out your daily routine and stick to it although the work turned out may be less.
('67', 278, 4, 11, 472969) Exercise should be deemed an essential item of the daily routine.

('67', 278, 8, 15, 473120) WARDHA, July 26, 1935
('67', 278, 9, 16, 473142) KEWALRAM,
('67', 278, 10, 17, 473152) All my fears have been proved true.
('67', 278, 10, 18, 473188) In fact there is nothing like private or public humiliation.
('67', 278, 10, 19, 473249) And that, too, for a servant of the public [like me], my humiliation is that of the public and theirs is mine.
('67', 278, 10, 20, 473360) We are the people and the people are we.
('67', 278, 10, 21, 473401) Where is the difference between man and world?
('67', 278, 10, 22, 473448) Whether you are lucky or unlucky, you lose only because somebody is there to lend you.
('67', 278, 10, 23, 473535) You ask for my advice.
('67', 278, 10, 24, 473558) Just stick to two rules: 1. You will not undertake anything.
('67', 278, 10, 25, 473619) 2. You will not start independent business.
('67', 278, 10, 26, 473663) Your independence is your dependence.
('67', 278, 10, 27, 473701) How can you call a person dependent if he willingly serves under somebody?
('67', 278, 10, 28, 473776) Do you take away somebodys freedom when you employ him?
('67', 278, 10, 29, 473832) Servant and master are man made divisions.
('67', 278, 10, 30, 473875) Serving means observing certain rules and being the master is doing as you wish to.
('67', 278, 10, 31, 473959) How will you choose between the two?
('67', 278, 10, 32, 473996) How long can I go on advising you like this?

('67', 279, 1, 3, 474157) 1, but I see no such possibility.
('67', 279, 1, 4, 474191) It is good that you should go on learning from your mistakes.
('67', 279, 1, 5, 474253) The treatment available in Wadhwan is good.
('67', 279, 1, 6, 474297) Besides you have your house and your generous father is there.

('67', 279, 5, 13, 474546) [Before July 27, 1935]
('67', 279, 6, 14, 474569) We are not judged so much by the big things that we do as by the smallest.
('67', 279, 6, 15, 474644) You might have chosen a better sheet of paper, written more legibly and you had certainly no excuse to write in English, which you do not seem to know well, when you could do so in Gujarati or Hindi.
('67', 279, 6, 16, 474844) Take care of your pence and the pounds will take care of themselves is not only a maxim of economic thrift.
('67', 279, 6, 17, 474952) It is a moral maxim as well.
('67', 279, 6, 18, 474981) No matter how insignificant the thing is you have to do it as well as you can, give it as much of your care and attention as you would give to the thing you regard as most important.
('67', 279, 6, 19, 475164) For it will be by those small things that you shall be judged.
('67', 279, 7, 20, 475227) Harijan, 27 7 1935
('67', 279, 8, 21, 475246) 444. HOW TO BEGIN
('67', 279, 9, 22, 475264) Whether it is to be a standard rate or a minimm for khadi artisans, a change seems to be a certainty.
('67', 279, 9, 23, 475366) With the exception of one dissentient of the many opinions so far received, none has opposed my proposal for fixing an increased rate.
('67', 279, 9, 24, 475501) No one has yet been found to endorse the eight anna proposal.
('67', 279, 9, 25, 475563) 3 Some of the writers regard the
('67', 279, 10, 26, 475596) 1 The source is illegible here.
('67', 279, 10, 27, 475628) 2 This is extracted from Mahadev Desai's Weekly Letter.
('67', 279, 10, 28, 475684) Gandhiji, who had substituted oil cake for dal in the Ashram diet, asked everyone to express in writing what he or she felt about it.
('67', 279, 10, 29, 475818) Three members disapproved of the move and dal was immediately restored.
('67', 279, 10, 30, 475890) But the little slip of paper signed by them served Gandhiji as a peg on which to hang a sermon.
('67', 279, 10, 31, 475986) 3 Vide Need for a Standard wage, 13 7 1935
('67', 280, 0, 1, 476029) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 281
('67', 280, 1, 2, 476077) eight anna proposal as fatal to khadi.
('67', 280, 1, 3, 476116) The price of khadi will, in that case, have to be so far advanced, they say, that there will be very few buyers.
('67', 280, 1, 4, 476229) Be that as it may, in any change worthy of the name some conditions will have to be fulfilled.
('67', 280, 1, 5, 476324) It will therefore be wise to take time by the forelock and enforce the following immediatly wherever it is at all possible:
('67', 280, 2, 6, 476448) 1. The workers should master all the processes from cotton picking to weaving so as to be able to teach others.
('67', 280, 2, 7, 476560) 2. Organizers should make a register of all the carders, spinners, weavers, etc., within their circle or jurisidiction.
('67', 280, 2, 8, 476680) 3. They should know the variety of cotton used by their spinners, and see that they do not attempt to spin a higher count than it is capable of.
('67', 280, 2, 9, 476825) 4. Spinners and the other artisans should be warned that unless they use khadi in their own households, they may not get any work.
('67', 280, 2, 10, 476956) 5. The artisans so warned should have facilities put in their way, so as to enable them always to get their khadi for their labour.
('67', 280, 2, 11, 477088) 6. Every hank of yarn received should be examined for its strength and evenness, all uneven and weak yarn being rejected, even as underbaked bread would be.
('67', 280, 2, 12, 477245) 7. As a rule, each spinners yarn should be stocked separately and woven when there is enough for a piece.
('67', 280, 2, 13, 477351) This will ensure durability of khadi and an all round improvement in the texture and appearance.
('67', 280, 2, 14, 477448) 8. All pieces thus prepared should have labels attached to them giving the names of ginners, carders, spinners and weavers where they are all different.
('67', 280, 2, 15, 477601) 9. Where artisans are members of families, the latter should be induced and encouraged to have all the processes in their own homes.
('67', 280, 2, 16, 477734) This will be easy when the wages are equalized or nearly so.
('67', 280, 2, 17, 477795) 10. The lives and budgets of families coming under the influence of the workers should be carefully studied and those who spend their earnings judiciously should be helped.
('67', 280, 2, 18, 477968) 11. If ever it becomes necessary to restrict the number of artisans served by the Association, by reason of shortage of custom, those who have other means of livelihood should be first eliminated.
('67', 280, 2, 19, 478165) At present, I understand, in several provinces, it is not only the
('67', 281, 0, 1, 478232) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 282
('67', 281, 1, 2, 478274) neediest who spin but also the thrifty women who want a little money for themselves to buy a few trifles, rather than to have better food or to pay debts.
('67', 281, 1, 3, 478429) 12. In every case the workers will have to closely examine the carding bows and the wheels, especially the latter with reference to the spindles and their revolutions.
('67', 281, 1, 4, 478597) For the proposed increase will never be a rise pure and simple.
('67', 281, 1, 5, 478661) It will be partly earned by greater and better output in the same time and partly there will be pure increase.
('67', 281, 1, 6, 478772) No spinner who refuses to make any improvement in her or his manner of work is likely to get any increase unless the demand for khadi increases.
('67', 281, 1, 7, 478917) 13. It follows from the last paragraph that new machines or parts will have to be supplied by the associations on easy terms in the first instance.
('67', 281, 1, 8, 479065) In many cases alterations in the mal (string) and the spindle will automatically increase and improve the quality of the output.
('67', 281, 1, 9, 479194) All these conditions can be fulfilled only if the workers realize that they have a grand mission and that they are but humble units in a vast family of artisans and labourers who are semi starved or underfed.
('67', 281, 1, 10, 479403) I have not touched the question of cotton growing.
('67', 281, 1, 11, 479454) So far I have dealt with the khadi that is manufactured for the market.
('67', 281, 1, 12, 479526) Some different rules will govern self sufficient khadi.
('67', 281, 1, 13, 479582) It will never succeed without cotton being grown by spinners themselves or practically in every village.
('67', 281, 1, 14, 479687) It means decentralization of cotton cultivations so far at least as self sufficient khadi is concerned.
('67', 281, 1, 15, 479791) For this we shall need a census of the villages served.
('67', 281, 1, 16, 479847) For not every spinner or weaver has a plot (ever so tiny) of land, where he or she can grow cotton.
('67', 281, 1, 17, 479947) Self sufficient khadi is a much bigger proposition, for which alone can the existence of the A. I.S.A. be justified.
('67', 281, 1, 18, 480064) It is a field as yet untouched by it on any scale worth mentioning.

('67', 281, 4, 21, 480162) NEED FOR CORRECTNESS Professor Malkani has been kindly sending me copies of the notices he has been issuing to the Provincial Sanghs on the necessity of compliance with the rules framed by the Central Board for the proper management of the wonderful organizations that have been
('67', 282, 0, 1, 480441) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 283
('67', 282, 1, 2, 480489) brought into being in the provinces.
('67', 282, 1, 3, 480526) They cannot function well or in co ordination with one another and with the Central Board unless they strictly carry out all the rules and instructions issued by the Central Board from time to time.
('67', 282, 1, 4, 480725) Failure to comply with requirements regarding budgets or preparation of accounts must result in bad financea very serious matter for a Board having numerous branches which have control of large funds.
('67', 282, 1, 5, 480926) Failure to send in regular reports of work done must leave the Centre in the dark and impair the efficiency of work.
('67', 282, 1, 6, 481043) Failure to attend meetings must bring work of the Sangh to a standstill resulting in stagnation and finally disruption.
('67', 282, 1, 7, 481163) If attention to rules and instructions is held to be essential in business organizations, how much more must it be so in the working of a voluntary, philanthropic or penitential institution?It is to be hoped, therefore, that all the component parts of the Sangh will respond to the requirements from the Centre and thus by correct behaviour hasten the disappearance of the canker of untouchability from our midst.
('67', 282, 2, 8, 481577) A PLEA FOR PURITY A correspondent, himself an editor, sends me cuttings from one single newspaper owned or managed by a public worker of approved merit.
('67', 282, 2, 9, 481730) They were with one exception about medicine.
('67', 282, 2, 10, 481775) In my opinion they were highly objectionable.
('67', 282, 2, 11, 481821) They contained indecent suggestions calculated to excite and promote animal passion in man.
('67', 282, 2, 12, 481913) These advertisements were taken from recent issues of the newspaper concerned.
('67', 282, 2, 13, 481992) They were all claimed to possess the virtue of rejuvenating their users.
('67', 282, 2, 14, 482065) The description was revolting.
('67', 282, 2, 15, 482096) Some of them were manifest lies.
('67', 282, 2, 16, 482129) My correspondent tells me that the newspaper from which he had taken the cuttings was by no means the sole offender.
('67', 282, 2, 17, 482246) He could send me similar cuttings from others known to be popular and respectable.
('67', 282, 2, 18, 482329) The proprietors of such newspapers probably do not know that their sheets contain indecent advertisements.
('67', 282, 2, 19, 482436) Perhaps they have not even read them.
('67', 282, 2, 20, 482474) Let me hope that the editors and managers of newspapers will study their advertisements and remove those that are without doubt objectionable.
('67', 282, 2, 21, 482617) I trust, too, that journalists associations in the provinces will take up the matter and persuade proprietors to exercise restraint in the matter of admitting advertisements.
('67', 282, 2, 22, 482792) It is not too much to expect them to remove all such as are likely to corrupt public morals or offend sense of decency.

('67', 283, 3, 11, 483474) He is hard working.

('67', 284, 6, 11, 485383) 449. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 1
('67', 284, 7, 12, 485411) July 27, 1935
('67', 284, 8, 13, 485425) Q. Apart from reforms in sanitation and food habits, as for example in respect of flour, rice, gur, oil, etc., what other reforms are necessary for an ideal village?
('67', 284, 9, 14, 485591) A. Every village has to be studied individually.
('67', 284, 10, 15, 485640) Q. Should I obey parents and other relatives and keep away from participating in activities of universal benefit when I am certain that there injunction is prompted only by misguided love?
('67', 284, 11, 16, 485829) A. In that case disobedience might be dharma for you.
('67', 284, 12, 17, 485883) Q. Would it be right to obey a command of ones superiors, viz., parents, teachers and official superiors, if it goes against any one of the vows of truth, non violence and so on?
('67', 284, 14, 18, 486062) Q. The following is one of the ten rules laid down by the Arya Samaj: An individual has some freedom in the observance of all rules of particular benefit but none in observing rules of universal benefit.
('67', 284, 15, 19, 486266) 1 The questions were asked by Avadhesh Dutt Avasthi on July 25, 1935.
('67', 285, 0, 1, 486336) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 286
('67', 285, 1, 2, 486378) A. It is not quite clear to me.
('67', 285, 1, 3, 486410) If so, would it not mean that a vicious custom prevalent in society but calling for eradication should be conformed to until the whole of society or the majority is in favour of its eradication?
('67', 285, 1, 4, 486605) In other words, one should not individually offer active opposition to it though one may continue other efforts.
('67', 285, 1, 5, 486718) I want to learn the duty of an average individual.
('67', 285, 1, 6, 486769) A great man of course attracts the popular opinion to follow him in whichever cause he adopts.
('67', 285, 1, 7, 486864) The individual should firmly adhere to his duty.
('67', 285, 2, 8, 486913) Q. You have stated that only those jail rules really offending ones self respect need be disregarded.
('67', 285, 2, 9, 487015) Therefore it may be explained which of these following seven conditions are really derogatory to ones self respect as these were usually the causes of conflict in all the jails:
('67', 285, 3, 10, 487193) To be counted by pairs, to perform tasks in spite of abuse and beatings, to be served by the barber with handcuffs on, to be subjected to restraints in saying prayers, to remain standing during the parade holding ones ticket, to parade, to be searched morning and evening in an objectionable manner.
('67', 285, 4, 11, 487493) A. We should disregard only that which we feel violates our dharma.
('67', 285, 5, 12, 487561) Q. You have said that dharma enjoins a husband to provide for the wife and also to co operate with her so long as she follows his way of life.
('67', 285, 5, 13, 487704) Therefore what is the husbands duty when the wife holds views opposed to his and does not adopt his ways, and what is the wifes duty when the situation is reversed?
('67', 285, 6, 14, 487869) A. Dharma indicates that they live separately and the husband provides for the wife.
('67', 285, 7, 15, 487954) Q. If anyone, especially a poor man or a Harijan, due to some reason, is being abused or beaten in my presence by a State official or a policeman or any arrogant person, especially a savarna as happens often enough, what would be my duty?
('67', 285, 8, 16, 488193) A. You should render non violent help to the victim by pleading with the oppressor.
('67', 285, 9, 17, 488277) Q. Would it not be right to kill a mad elephant or a dog that has caused death to many and that is altogether uncontrollable?
('67', 285, 9, 18, 488403) And if this is right, would it be proper for the State to give the same or similar treatment to men turned mad by selfishness, lust and anger?
('67', 285, 10, 19, 488546) A. It is possible to control even a mad elephant if one bears him true love and, as for insane people, the State has already some arrangement.
('67', 285, 11, 20, 488689) Q. Is man by nature slightly superior to woman?
('67', 286, 0, 1, 488737) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 287
('67', 286, 2, 2, 488785) Q. Why is that women usually suffer no embarrassment in wearing male apparel while men feel it a matter of humiliation to dress like women?
('67', 286, 2, 3, 488925) I think women regard masculinity to be somewhat superior.
('67', 286, 3, 4, 488983) A. It is because man attributes weakness to woman.
('67', 286, 4, 5, 489034) Q. What is the reason behind your avoidance of food cooked on fire?
('67', 286, 5, 6, 489102) A. Non violence, saving on expense and time, health and so on.
('67', 286, 6, 7, 489165) Q. Owing to some reasons I have formed the opinion that one should keep totally aloof from political and social movements while one is a student.
('67', 286, 6, 8, 489311) Am I correct in this opinion?
('67', 286, 7, 9, 489341) A. That is for you to decide.

('67', 286, 8, 11, 489418) 450. VIOLENCE v.
('67', 286, 8, 12, 489435) NON VIOLENCE
('67', 286, 9, 13, 489448) A reader of Harijanbandhu writes to say: 1
('67', 286, 10, 14, 489491) The confrontation between violence and non violence has lasted from time immemorial and will last till eternity.
('67', 286, 10, 15, 489604) Everyone will interpret these words in his own way and act in accordance with his wishes and his capacity.
('67', 286, 10, 16, 489711) Hence, it seems that any further discussion on this much debated topic will not take us much further.
('67', 286, 10, 17, 489813) However, the way I look at non violence in our enfeebled circumstances appears to be a novel viewpoint and this sometimes has even hurt the votaries of non violence.
('67', 286, 10, 18, 489979) Non Violence is the characteristic of a brave man.
('67', 286, 10, 19, 490030) Fear and non violence are deadly enemies.
('67', 286, 10, 20, 490072) We are unable to see non violence inits true form as we are surrounded by fear and have become accustomed to look at it from a distorted angle.
('67', 286, 10, 21, 490216) This introduction seems necessary for a consideration of the above letter.
('67', 286, 10, 22, 490291) We have no evidence before us to support the belief that the death rate is higher where the number of snakes killed is great.
('67', 286, 10, 23, 490417) On the contrary snakes are seldom found in places where people have unanimously decided to make it their dharma to kill every snake.
('67', 286, 10, 24, 490550) But this evidence cannot establish the dharma of violence.
('67', 286, 10, 25, 490609) Non violence
('67', 286, 11, 26, 490622) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('67', 286, 11, 27, 490659) The correspondent had stated that he was unable to overcome the fear of snakes, though he knew that ahimsa was the law of life.
('67', 287, 0, 1, 490787) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 288
('67', 287, 1, 2, 490829) can be proved only by dying.
('67', 287, 1, 3, 490858) The practice of killing has always been there.
('67', 287, 1, 4, 490905) This state of affairs shocked a certain brave man who proclaimed: This is not dharma. Non violence alone is the true religion for all times.
('67', 287, 2, 5, 491046) If I have suggested that snakes should be killed in certain circumstances, it is to help non violence, not to destroy it.
('67', 287, 2, 6, 491168) Non violence is an attitude of mind.
('67', 287, 2, 7, 491205) My non violence is not put to shame if I kill a snake through fear although my efforts are directed towards befriending it.
('67', 287, 2, 8, 491329) If I make the fullest effort, I can even reach this ideal.
('67', 287, 3, 9, 491388) It is not because we are merciful that we refrain from killing snakes and such other creatures; we are persuaded to do so because we traditionally believe that there is non violence in doing so and hence do not kill snakes.
('67', 287, 3, 10, 491612) We cannot claim that human beings are kind towards those whom they fear.
('67', 287, 3, 11, 491685) He who is strong is merciful towards the weak.
('67', 287, 3, 12, 491732) Where is the mercy in catching hold of a snake and throwing it away because we are afraid of it?
('67', 287, 3, 13, 491829) While doing so, generally we do not even have the notion that some day we shall make friends with the snake.
('67', 287, 3, 14, 491938) Non violence is the dharma of awakening.
('67', 287, 3, 15, 491979) Its votary has to make conscious use of it at every moment as we are surrounded by violence on all sides.
('67', 287, 3, 16, 492085) Every one of us has according to his capacity to make his own way out of this dangerous predicament.
('67', 287, 4, 17, 492186) Let us examine that act of refraining from killing a serpent.
('67', 287, 4, 18, 492248) When a snake comes to attack us, we shall certainly kill it because it does not attack us.
('67', 287, 4, 19, 492339) While going its own way, it strays from its path and comes into our homes.
('67', 287, 4, 20, 492414) We then catch hold of it and throw it far away.
('67', 287, 4, 21, 492462) While taking care that it does not attack us, we subject it to as much pain as is necessary.
('67', 287, 4, 22, 492555) Mercy plays no part in this, but what is at work is the fear of punishment in our next birth for our failure to practise the dharma of non violence.
('67', 287, 4, 23, 492704) We have given no proof of our bravery in not killing the snake.
('67', 287, 4, 24, 492768) Killing it would not have been a courageous act either.
('67', 287, 4, 25, 492824) The motive behind both [the killing and non killing] is fear.
('67', 287, 4, 26, 492886) If mercy in its pure state were present in me, I would catch hold of the serpent and befriend it and rid others of the fear of snakes.
('67', 287, 4, 27, 493021) We do hear stories of sadhus who do this.
('67', 287, 4, 28, 493063) It is possible that these reports are not true or are mere exaggerations.
('67', 287, 4, 29, 493137) However, if non violence is real, such friendship between snakes and human beings is not an impossibility.
('67', 288, 0, 1, 493244) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 289
('67', 288, 1, 2, 493292) If this much is clear to the reader, he will realize that there is no room for doubt regarding the sentence 1 in question.
('67', 288, 1, 3, 493415) This does not imply that so long as the fear of snakes presists, these should be killed at sight.
('67', 288, 1, 4, 493513) However, wherever their danger continues, it is not necessary to have any hesitation in killing them, as underlying that fear there is a deep rooted desire for their death.
('67', 288, 1, 5, 493686) One feels free from fear when one kills them.
('67', 288, 1, 6, 493732) I cannot imagine a more pitiable condition for the non violent person.
('67', 288, 1, 7, 493803) Anyone who attempts to befriend snakes and such other creatures will not rest satisfied by solving such problems in the traditional manner, but will rather make an effort to rid himself of the fear of such ferocious animals without indulging in violence of any kind.
('67', 288, 1, 8, 494070) The example of a beautiful woman is not applicable here at all.
('67', 288, 1, 9, 494134) If anyone desires her and tries to seduce her, many persons will be ready to beat him up.
('67', 288, 1, 10, 494224) Human beings suppress such desires.
('67', 288, 1, 11, 494260) Or by consciously nurturing them they seek the means of their own destruction.
('67', 288, 1, 12, 494339) The comparison with snakes could be made in the following manner.
('67', 288, 1, 13, 494405) Rather than be infatuated by a woman and yield to this infatuation, I should destroy the serpent within me or, in other words, drown myself by jumping into a well.
('67', 288, 1, 14, 494569) This should be regarded as pure non violence and be considered an act of bravery.
('67', 288, 1, 15, 494651) Snakes and such other creatures are symbols for us.
('67', 288, 1, 16, 494703) The passions within us are the reflection of evil.
('67', 288, 1, 17, 494754) If we make a Herculean effort to rid ourselves of the fear of our fellow creatures such as snakes.
('67', 288, 1, 18, 494853) However, so long as we cannot do so, we should do whatever we think best while entertaining the desire for friendship.

('67', 288, 4, 21, 495013) 1 The correspondent had quoted the following from Mahadev Desais Gujarati translation of Ideals and Practice (p.
('67', 288, 4, 22, 495126) 248) which appeared in Harijanbandhu, 14 7 1935: Ahimsa is the law of life, but if I have not shed the fear of serpents, what am I to do?
('67', 288, 4, 23, 495264) My mind has already killed the serpent, only the flesh is weak.
('67', 288, 4, 24, 495328) Your duty says: Kill it.
('67', 288, 4, 25, 495353) Give up the vain attempt of refraining from killing it.

('67', 291, 6, 11, 498321) I liked the charkha made by you and therefore tried hard and have mastered it.
('67', 291, 6, 12, 498400) I even made some improvements in it which occurred to me.
('67', 291, 6, 13, 498458) But I could not pass your budget.
('67', 291, 6, 14, 498492) How can I find two persons?
('67', 291, 6, 15, 498520) It may be possible if you can persuade Maruti 3 or Lakshmidas 4. But, as the saying is, one cannot go to heaven without oneself dying.
('67', 291, 6, 16, 498655) I, therefore, feel that you will have to rely on yourself.
('67', 291, 6, 17, 498714) I will do what I can.

('67', 291, 6, 22, 498936) My figures regarding spinning seem all right.
('67', 291, 6, 23, 498982) You are completely mistaken about village industries.
('67', 291, 6, 24, 499036) Even if you were to list twice as many industries as you have done, you will still not be able to show that the variation in wage follows any fixed rule.
('67', 291, 6, 25, 499190) The disparity is as between men and women and does not follow the principle that the greater the risk the higher the wage.
('67', 291, 6, 26, 499313) Nature has laid it down that all have equal needs.
('67', 291, 6, 27, 499364) Indeed all the workers should be paid at the same rate.
('67', 291, 6, 28, 499420) You have seen equality in inequality here, but that is fallacy.
('67', 291, 6, 29, 499484) Think over the matter again.
('67', 291, 6, 30, 499513) I agree that those who are receiving more wages today will not agree to accept less.
('67', 291, 6, 31, 499598) That does not worry me.
('67', 291, 6, 32, 499622) I shall be satisfied if those who are getting less receive

('67', 295, 3, 4, 503705) NARAHARI, I read your letter regarding the Vidyapith.
('67', 295, 3, 5, 503759) What pay has been fixed for Jayabehn?
('67', 295, 3, 6, 503797) Dont you think there is something wrong with our training so that, though we have at least twenty five women, not one of them has been trained in the way you want?
('67', 295, 3, 7, 503961) And if that is the case, how can we expect to get a woman from outside who would fit into our mould?
('67', 295, 3, 8, 504062) I feel that we shall have to reap as we have sown.
('67', 295, 3, 9, 504113) Do not have the slightest suspicion that I include myself in we merely out of politeness.
('67', 295, 3, 10, 504203) I know my limitations full well.
('67', 295, 3, 11, 504236) I do consider myself a teacher but I am no better than a shrub in a desert.
('67', 295, 3, 12, 504312) Having said all this, what I want to tell you is simply that you should aim ultimately at producing from among ourselves a woman worker of the type you want.
('67', 295, 3, 13, 504470) Some day your effort will succeed.
('67', 295, 3, 14, 504505) Be sure that all attempts to get such a worker from outside will be futile.
('67', 295, 3, 15, 504581) Even if there is a chance of your succeeding in such an attempt, it will be to our good and ensure the success of our mission not to make it.
('67', 295, 3, 16, 504723) Do you teach the girls the new method of spinning on the takli?
('67', 295, 3, 17, 504787) That method is of great importa nce.
('67', 295, 3, 18, 504824) By following it, little girls attain a speed of 80 rounds per half hour in just 15 days time, as it is very easy to learn.
('67', 295, 3, 19, 504947) Test from time to time the girls speed of spinning on the takli and on the spinning wheel.
('67', 295, 3, 20, 505038) I am not writing anything about the Vidyapith just now.
('67', 295, 3, 21, 505094) I have been constantly thinking about the goshala.
('67', 295, 3, 22, 505145) I still feel that either we should take over some pinjrapole and keep the useless cattle there, or we should set up one ourselves along with the dairy.
('67', 295, 3, 23, 505297) Such cattle can be kept only in Bidaj or some such place.
('67', 295, 3, 24, 505355) Parnerkars idea of securing the co operation of Bharawads attracts me more and more.
('67', 295, 3, 25, 505440) I wish to try that experiment on a large scale here.
('67', 295, 3, 26, 505493) I am only waiting for Dahyalal to get ready.
('67', 295, 3, 27, 505538) Titus may perhaps come.
('67', 295, 3, 28, 505562) I had a telegram from him.
('67', 295, 3, 29, 505589) What I have understood from Parnerkar is this: We should have complete control over the Bharawads cattle.
('67', 295, 3, 30, 505695) They should give the cattle fodder of our choice; should milk them and rear the calves scientifically.
('67', 295, 3, 31, 505798) We on our part undertake to sell the milk obtained from them.
('67', 295, 3, 32, 505860) If the last two suggestions cannot be implemented, forget about them.
('67', 295, 3, 33, 505930) Keep as many good cows as you can manage and do whatever is practicable.

('67', 296, 1, 8, 506299) He comes from Baroda.

('67', 296, 1, 10, 506373) He knows Gujarati, Sanskrit and Marathi.
('67', 296, 1, 11, 506414) Most probably he also knows English.
('67', 296, 1, 12, 506451) He requires only twenty five rupees as pay.
('67', 296, 1, 13, 506495) I would advise you to employ him either in Vinaya Mandir or in the Harijan Ashram.
('67', 296, 1, 14, 506578) Vinoba thinks that he will prove useful if we employ him.
('67', 296, 1, 15, 506636) He is a very pious man.

('67', 296, 7, 24, 507085) Gandhiji, I understand, has made it clear in response to enquiries that no such appeal for funds has been issued by him.
('67', 296, 7, 25, 507206) 4 Gandhiji refuses to be interviewed on the Italo Abyssinian question on the ground that a verbal expression of opinion would be valueless unless he was also able to follow it up by action.

('67', 296, 8, 29, 507735) 3 The statement was reported under the date line Wardha, August 1, 1935. 4 The source had reported the rumour seems to have got abroad of which nothing at all has been heard in India, that Gandhiji has issued an appeal for funds for raising a volunteer corps of Indians for Red Cross Service in Abyssinia.
('67', 296, 8, 30, 508041) The rumour starting apparently from London has travelled to America and Gandhiji has been the astonished recipient of a cabled message from America congratulating him on his action.

('67', 297, 3, 4, 508320) I am surprised at the statement attributed by Reuters Agency to Lord Zetland 1 that Mr. M. R.

('67', 297, 3, 5, 508596) I distinctly remember the occasion and I am quite sure that there was nothing in his speech showing that he advocated violence His objection was, like that of many others, to the introduction in a political creed of expressions of a more or less religious character.
('67', 297, 3, 6, 508863) I can only therefore hope that Lord Zetland, occupying, as he does, one of the most responsible positions under the Crown, did not allow hi mself to make use of the unequivocal language attributed to his Lordship.

('67', 298, 3, 4, 509925) MY DEAR APRAKASH,
('67', 298, 4, 5, 509943) Why should it be galling to you to be on trial at your age.
('67', 298, 4, 6, 510003) Age is rather against you in a novel experiment.
('67', 298, 4, 7, 510052) A stranger would be on trial no matter how able he is.
('67', 298, 4, 8, 510107) Much more so one who embarks like you on a new venture.
('67', 298, 4, 9, 510163) Why should we assume that the world knows us as we think we are?

('67', 298, 4, 12, 510391) Humility is the key to peace and real joy.

('67', 299, 2, 2, 511049) A GOOD SERVANT GONE
('67', 299, 3, 3, 511069) Nibaranbabu who dies the other day in Purulia was one of the gentlest of souls.
('67', 299, 3, 4, 511149) He was a true servant of Harijans and equally true friend of all the poor.
('67', 299, 3, 5, 511224) He had realized to the full the matchless beauty of non violence which had become a living creed with him.
('67', 299, 3, 6, 511331) His life was an inspiration to many of his friends and followers who looked to him for guidance and comfort in their darkest hours.
('67', 299, 3, 7, 511463) May the memory of it ever sustain them and move them from good to better.
('67', 299, 4, 8, 511537) WEALTH WELL USED
('67', 299, 5, 9, 511554) Shri Jwala Prasad Mandelia, a great servant of Harijans, is no more.
('67', 299, 5, 10, 511623) He was the treasurer of the Central Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('67', 299, 5, 11, 511680) And what a treasurer he was to the cause which he loved with a rare passion!
('67', 299, 5, 12, 511757) He could not be called a wealthy man as the expression is understood nowadays.
('67', 299, 5, 13, 511836) But he was secretary of the Birla Mills and earned well.
('67', 299, 5, 14, 511893) He has willed away practically all he possessed.
('67', 299, 5, 15, 511942) During his lifetime too he spent liberally on charities.
('67', 299, 5, 16, 511999) He was a born reformer.
('67', 299, 5, 17, 512023) The cause of the widow was as dear to him as that of Harijans, and by his will he provided for both these, the bequest to be spent in his home, Pilani.

('67', 300, 1, 2, 512241) 471. SELF SUFFICIENT KHADI
('67', 300, 2, 3, 512268) The conditions promoting the success of and governing self sufficient khadi are different from those governing khadi produced for the town dweller who would not or cannot toil to make it at any stage of its manufacture.
('67', 300, 2, 4, 512488) In khadi, made for sale, every process from sowing and picking of cotton to weaving the yarn can be distributed with ease, especially when the cost of labour is equalized or nearly so.
('67', 300, 2, 5, 512673) Specialization under supervision and on a co operative basis must yield better returns.
('67', 300, 2, 6, 512761) But where an article is produced for personal use, the greater the concentration of all the processes in the same family or even the same hands, the greater the economy of time and money.
('67', 300, 2, 7, 512949) A person, who has a little land which he can call his own even for a fair period and works on it daily, can have his khadi for mere labour put in by him or his during their odd moments.
('67', 300, 2, 8, 513135) All he needs is instruction or education to show how each one can make his own khadi practically for nothing.
('67', 300, 2, 9, 513245) When labour has to be paid for and that at an equal rate per period, spinning would take in the largest part of the outlay.
('67', 300, 2, 10, 513369) For spinning yarn for one yard of Khadi takes longer then any of the other processes anterior or posterior to it will take.
('67', 300, 2, 11, 513493) If a person gins, cards and spins for himself, which he can do easily, he will get his khadi almost at the same price as mill cloth.
('67', 300, 2, 12, 513626) The cost of an article represents the cost of labour spent in its production.
('67', 300, 2, 13, 513704) So when the whole labour comes from the user himself the cost is practically nothing, when that labour is given during leisure hours.
('67', 300, 2, 14, 513838) Self suffcient khadi eliminates the middleman altogether.
('67', 300, 2, 15, 513896) It is the easiest method of perceptibly increasing the income of the millions of the semi starved villagers.
('67', 300, 2, 16, 514005) But will the villager ever take to self sufficent khadi?
('67', 300, 2, 17, 514062) Yes, if we have faith accompanied by technical skill, or rather a living faith that will move mountains and give the worker all the skill necessary for his task which is undoubtedly difficult.
('67', 300, 2, 18, 514255) But whether difficult or easy it has hardly been attempted as yet on any large or organized scale or a well conceived plan.
('67', 300, 2, 19, 514379) Not without a well conceived, India wide effort to educate the villagers to produce their own cloth and thus stop the unnecessary drain from their villages of what little they possess, will the A.I.S.A. have justified its existence; for as I have been of late insisting in these columns, the message of khadi is nothing less than its
('67', 301, 0, 1, 514713) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 302
('67', 301, 1, 2, 514755) universal use in the villages by local production and local use.
('67', 301, 1, 3, 514820) The beginning has to be made by inducing cotton cultivation in every village, even in those where it is never known to have been grown.
('67', 301, 1, 4, 514956) Without decentralization of cotton cultivation, universal manufacture in villages may not be possible.
('67', 301, 1, 5, 515059) We have authentic examples of deserts having been turned into smiling gardens by judicious manipulation of the soil.
('67', 301, 1, 6, 515176) It ought not, therefore, to be impossible to grow enough cotton in every village, for local use.
('67', 301, 1, 7, 515273) Not only will this cheapen khadi for the villagers, but it will also improve the durability of khadi.
('67', 301, 1, 8, 515375) Experience has conclusively demonstrated that the strength of yarn and the output are affected by the variety of cotton used and the manner of picking, cleaning, ginning, carding and spinning cotton.
('67', 301, 1, 9, 515575) A material from which the famous Dacca muslin could be produced must demand gentle handling during all the processes it undergoes, before it comes out as shabnam or the morningdew.

('67', 301, 3, 12, 515804) Why worry about those who do not do body labour?
('67', 301, 3, 13, 515853) I have never imagined that every man on earth will earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, but I have simply enunciated the golden rule.
('67', 301, 3, 14, 515991) Are you prepared to do it?
('67', 301, 3, 15, 516018) If you are, you need not be jealous of the man who is not prepared to do it or cannot do it.
('67', 301, 3, 16, 516111) I may not be able to earn what fruit and milk I eat by mere body labour, but that means that I am to be pitied, the rule is not affected.
('67', 301, 3, 17, 516249) Only a few people can observe brahmacharya, but should they, therefore, be jealous of the millions who cannot?
('67', 301, 3, 18, 516360) The latter may be pitied, rather than be envied.
('67', 301, 3, 19, 516409) I have indicated the ideal to work up to.
('67', 301, 3, 20, 516451) Let everyone try to observe it as best as one can.
('67', 301, 3, 21, 516502) Dont worry because you are incapable of doing any body labour.
('67', 301, 3, 22, 516565) Do whatever other clean labour you can, and be sure that you do not exploit those that labour for you.
('67', 301, 3, 23, 516668) Do not worry about the doctors and the rest who in your opinion seem to have no time for body labour.
('67', 301, 3, 24, 516770) When they will practise their professions in a pure spirit of service to the community, the community will take care to see that they are not starved.

('67', 302, 3, 9, 517651) I havent yet heard from him.
('67', 302, 3, 10, 517680) What was the charge against him?
('67', 302, 3, 11, 517713) It should be enough for assistant teachers like him if they attend the school in khadi.
('67', 302, 3, 12, 517801) Nothing more should be expected of them.
('67', 302, 3, 13, 517842) It would be fine, of course, if he has faith in khadi.

('67', 303, 3, 4, 518822) JAMNALAL, You are proceeding to Indore to collect funds for the purse.
('67', 303, 3, 5, 518893) In this connection you want to be clear on these three points: 1. How will this money be spent?
('67', 303, 3, 6, 518989) 2. Should any earmarked donation be accepted?
('67', 303, 3, 7, 519035) 3. Whether I wish to form a trust or a committee to deal with the expenditure or if I have thought of any alternative arrangement.
('67', 303, 3, 8, 519166) Here is my clarification on these points: Although my main requirement is for the propagation of Hindi in South India, I would like to utilize the funds when occasion arises for provinces like Bengal, Assam, Sind, Gujarat and Punjab where Hindi is not known well or has not been propagated.
('67', 303, 3, 9, 519457) There should be no objection to accepting for the purse earmaked contributions if a donor wishes to contribute for the work in any of these provinces or for the training of necessary propagandists.
('67', 303, 3, 10, 519655) Now about a trust or a committee.
('67', 303, 3, 11, 519689) I intend to form a trust or a committee or a registered institution when the whole sum is collected and disburse the funds through it under my own supervision.

('67', 306, 7, 9, 523620) Hansa is a unique enterprise in the whole of India.
('67', 306, 7, 10, 523672) A monthly of this kind is sorely needed if Hindi or Hindustani is to become the national language.
('67', 306, 7, 11, 523771) Through the medium of the national language all should become acquainted with the current writings in all the provincial languages.
('67', 306, 7, 12, 523903) It is very gratifying that whosoever desires can get this benefit at a cost of only half a rupee a month.

('67', 307, 3, 4, 524601) BHAI MUNSHI,
('67', 307, 4, 5, 524614) You have brought out an attractive pamphlet indeed.
('67', 307, 4, 6, 524666) You are certainly likely to spare no pains in regard to the get up.
('67', 307, 4, 7, 524734) If we always receive articles as attractively got up as this pamphlet, we can want nothing more.

('67', 307, 4, 11, 524981) If I get time, I will write out something.
('67', 307, 4, 12, 525024) Can you suggest a subject?
('67', 307, 4, 13, 525051) Take care and enlist enough subscribers in advance.
('67', 307, 4, 14, 525103) I had a brief talk with Tandonji, and that, too, by chance.
('67', 307, 4, 15, 525163) I had nothing particular to tell him.

('67', 308, 3, 4, 525910) DEAR SHIVAPRASAD,
('67', 308, 4, 5, 525928) Received your letter.
('67', 308, 4, 6, 525950) You have not forgotten the country even in your ill health.
('67', 308, 4, 7, 526010) After my severance from the Congress, the Working Committee met here for the first time.
('67', 308, 4, 8, 526099) It matters little whether it meets here or somewhere else.
('67', 308, 4, 9, 526158) Your question is why I am so very interested in the Congress after I have severed my connections with it, and why I give my advice and opinion to them.
('67', 308, 4, 10, 526310) I think you already know that when I severed my connection with the Congress I had already said that, if anything be referred to me.
('67', 308, 4, 11, 526443) I would give my opinion.
('67', 308, 4, 12, 526468) To control the Congress and to give advice to Congressmen are two different things.
('67', 308, 4, 13, 526552) The Congress Committee held its sittings here, but I never participated therein.
('67', 308, 4, 14, 526633) I am totally in the dark regarding its full proceedings up till now, Whenever any member wanted to consult me or have my opinion, they used to call at my place and I used to give them my advice most willingly.
('67', 308, 4, 15, 526843) I do not see any reason for not doing so.
('67', 308, 4, 16, 526885) I came out of the Congress only for its benefit.
('67', 308, 4, 17, 526934) I cannot forgo the ideals of the Congress.
('67', 308, 4, 18, 526977) Knowingly if I refuse to give them my advice, I fall from dharma.
('67', 308, 5, 19, 527043) Now as regards Council entry, I think Council entry is dharma at this stage but not for myself, for I have devoted myself to something else.
('67', 308, 5, 20, 527184) My sadhana at present is non violent disobedience of laws.
('67', 308, 5, 21, 527243) Council entry will prove a hindrance in the realization of that end of mi ne.
('67', 308, 5, 22, 527321) Do you not know, what is one mans meat is another mans poison?
('67', 308, 6, 23, 527384) I hope I have given answers to all your questions which will be to your satisfaction.
('67', 308, 7, 24, 527470) Leave the Council entry to me and devote yourself entirely to village industry and Hindi prachar.
('67', 308, 7, 25, 527568) If you will devote heart and soul to the above, you will not get time to think of other things.

The Hindu had also reported: Mr. Mahadev Desai, Gandhijis Secretary, acknowledging the letter wrote, Your letter reached Bapuji.
('67', 309, 11, 13, 528588) As regards taking of the oath, Bapuji says that Council entry was decided upon seeing the present condition of our country and for those who take an oath, it is not good on their part to do anything against the Government.

('67', 310, 3, 4, 529072) MY DEAR GAVAI,
('67', 310, 4, 5, 529087) I have gone through the interesting document left by you with me.
('67', 310, 4, 6, 529153) This is my opinion: All rules must be interpreted so as to advance their purpose; in this case the interest of the Harijans.
('67', 310, 4, 7, 529278) Therefore election of four is not obligatory but if there are more than four candidates, four have to be elected by the college.
('67', 310, 4, 8, 529407) Withdrawals are certainly permissible at any stage.
('67', 310, 4, 9, 529459) Any candidate of the Harijan class has the right of becoming a candidate for the general election.
('67', 310, 4, 10, 529558) If the electoral college is considered a burden, Harijans can any day by practically unanimous agreement forgo the privilege.
('67', 310, 4, 11, 529684) Such a provision is made in the Pact itself.
('67', 310, 4, 12, 529729) Needless to say mine cannot be in any way regarded as a legal opinion.
('67', 310, 4, 13, 529800) It is that of one who had a hand in promoting the Pact.

('67', 310, 10, 25, 530905) Why should it be cowardice if one flees from a monster against whom one can never hold out?

('67', 312, 4, 11, 533346) The fact that the idea had occurred to my co workers before it did to me makes my path easier.

('67', 313, 8, 24, 535476) I am giving you one example : When I came yesterday you were writing. Here when is at the beginning of the sentence.
('67', 313, 8, 25, 535593) The second sentence is as follows : We were coming to school when the bell rang. Now in the first sentence when is placed at the beginning of the sentence and in the second sentence after.
('67', 313, 8, 26, 535782) Is there any difference in their usage?
('67', 313, 8, 27, 535822) Is there any rule as to when when is placed before or after?
('67', 313, 8, 28, 535883) Is the verb in the past tense when when is used?
('67', 313, 8, 29, 535932) (2) Another thing I do not know well is how to use since.
('67', 313, 8, 30, 535990) What is the difference between since, before and ago?
('67', 313, 8, 31, 536044) (3) The two words large and big are they synonyms?
('67', 313, 8, 32, 536095) Can both he used in the same place?
('67', 313, 8, 33, 536131) Is it the same with small and little?

('67', 314, 1, 2, 536217) level which you may not be able to keep up.
('67', 314, 1, 3, 536261) Take every step after careful thought.
('67', 314, 1, 4, 536300) If you do not follow any of the explanations I give in your exercises, ask me again.
('67', 314, 1, 5, 536385) If you use sheets of the same quality and size and keep a margin for comments, the exercises will be easier to preserve.

('67', 314, 5, 9, 536622) WARDHA, August 9, 1935
('67', 314, 6, 10, 536645) NARANDAS,
('67', 314, 7, 11, 536655) I scribbled a letter 1 to you yesterday in great hurry.
('67', 314, 7, 12, 536711) Enclosed are letters for Lilavati and Mathew.
('67', 314, 7, 13, 536757) Read the letter to Mathew carefully before passing it on to him.
('67', 314, 7, 14, 536822) You also should talk to him with firmness.
('67', 314, 7, 15, 536865) If he harasses you, relieve him.
('67', 314, 7, 16, 536898) Keep him only if he teaches carefully and puts his heart into his work, and also does some physical work.
('67', 314, 7, 17, 537004) What does he do for his meals?
('67', 314, 7, 18, 537035) Did you pay the rent for Harilal?
('67', 314, 7, 19, 537069) What makes you think he wouldnt get liquor in Junagadh?
('67', 314, 7, 20, 537125) Im sure he wont behave well in regard to anything.
('67', 314, 7, 21, 537176) One thing is certain, however.
('67', 314, 7, 22, 537207) You will have less trouble there, that is, if he does not come back.
('67', 314, 7, 23, 537276) I understand about Radha and Santok.
('67', 314, 7, 24, 537313) Your suggestion regarding Pyarelal is correct.
('67', 314, 7, 25, 537360) We have got to agree to it.
('67', 314, 7, 26, 537388) Enclosed please find another letter from Vajubhai.
('67', 314, 7, 27, 537439) As there was nothing new in it, I did not send it to you earlier.
('67', 314, 7, 28, 537505) There is no question of handing over the school to him.
('67', 314, 7, 29, 537561) It is you who have to develop it.
('67', 314, 7, 30, 537595) I have not yet been able to send him your letters.

('67', 315, 1, 2, 537795) 497. DISCUSSION ON REORGANIZING KHADI PRODUCTION 1
('67', 315, 2, 3, 537846) [Before August 10, 1935]
('67', 315, 3, 4, 537871) QUESTION: In Bihar something like five thousand women walk ten miles a day to receive the present scanty wage.
('67', 315, 3, 5, 537982) More would come if we could sell more khadi.
('67', 315, 3, 6, 538027) What would happen to these poor women, if the demand for khadi disappeared?
('67', 315, 4, 7, 538103) GANDHIJI: Quite, right.
('67', 315, 4, 8, 538127) I know the same is the state of things in Bengal villages and in South India.
('67', 315, 4, 9, 538205) But I would put your proposition in a converse way.
('67', 315, 4, 10, 538257) Supposing you gave one pie instead of two pies an hour that you give at present, you would be employing not 5,000 women but 10,000 women.
('67', 315, 4, 11, 538395) And supposing these helpless women were ready to accept even that miserable pittance, would you dare to do it?
('67', 315, 4, 12, 538506) I say, you would not.
('67', 315, 4, 13, 538528) That means that you will have to determine a point beyond which you cannot go.
('67', 315, 4, 14, 538607) Call it if you will a helpless minimum.
('67', 315, 4, 15, 538647) But if that minimum has to be fixed, why not fix it once and for all, no matter whether it affects some of the producers for the time being adversely?
('67', 315, 4, 16, 538798) So long as the number of purchasers is limited and the number of producers unlimited, there is no doubt that you will have to turn some of the producers away.
('67', 315, 4, 17, 538957) Why not then have a deliberately fixed, high enough minimum wage to ensure these poor women at least a living wage?
('67', 315, 4, 18, 539073) Otherwise there would be no end to this unconscious exploitation.
('67', 315, 4, 19, 539139) A paper manufacturer sends us paper from a place.
('67', 315, 4, 20, 539189) He is paying the labourers at the rate of six pice per day, and says he hopes to make the paper cheaper.
('67', 315, 4, 21, 539294) I tell him I will not have it cheaper.
('67', 315, 5, 22, 539333) Then you will now change the definition of khadi.
('67', 315, 5, 23, 539383) It no longer remains hand spun hand woven cloth, but cloth hand spun and hand woven at a particular wage.
('67', 315, 5, 24, 539489) There is no doubt.
('67', 315, 5, 25, 539508) I am sorry that you are making the discovery so late.
('67', 315, 6, 26, 539562) But spinning is a supplementary occupation, we have been telling the world all these years.
('67', 315, 6, 27, 539654) It is done only in ones spare hours.
('67', 315, 7, 28, 539691) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai who had explained that the presence of Congress Working Committee members like Rajendra Prasad, Vallabhbhai Patel, Jairamdas Doulatram, Jamnalal Bajaj, Pattabhi Sitaramayya, Gangadharrao Deshpande and J.B. Kripalani stimulated the discussion on the subject which had become a burning question ever since Gandhiji wrote the article on the Need for a Standard Wage
('67', 316, 0, 1, 540110) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 317
('67', 316, 1, 2, 540158) Yes and no.
('67', 316, 1, 3, 540170) I know that there are thousands who are doing it for the whole day.
('67', 316, 1, 4, 540238) To them it is not a supplementary but a substantive occupation.
('67', 316, 1, 5, 540302) And even if it is not, why not give them for an hours work what you would usually give for any other hours work?
('67', 316, 2, 6, 540415) Do you know that in some parts of Guntur District, people are taking to rice pounding because it fetches a higher wage than spinning?
('67', 316, 2, 7, 540549) But you support my argument.
('67', 316, 2, 8, 540578) They will certainly choose whatever work fetches them a higher wage.
('67', 316, 2, 9, 540647) Then why not dignify the spinner by a wage which will be equal to any other wage?
('67', 316, 3, 10, 540729) Practical difficulties are very great.
('67', 316, 3, 11, 540768) You cannot induce these spinners to conform to your terms.
('67', 316, 3, 12, 540827) You want a regular register of them, you want them to spin yarn of a particular count, of particular evenness and of particular strength.
('67', 316, 3, 13, 540965) How will all that be done?
('67', 316, 3, 14, 540992) The difficulties have got to be conquered.
('67', 316, 3, 15, 541035) Dont I know that for considerable length of time there will be tales of long drawn out agonysome saying we cannot induce the spinners to spin for themselves, some saying we cannot get them to conform to our requirements?
('67', 316, 4, 16, 541256) But supposing they conform to our regulations and we give them better machines and better spindles, they will automatically do more work and more than double the wage.
('67', 316, 4, 17, 541424) That they will do automatically but for no virtue of yours.
('67', 316, 4, 18, 541484) That more production means more earning is obvious enough.
('67', 316, 4, 19, 541543) But what are we going to do, by way of justice which we have denied them?
('67', 316, 4, 20, 541617) No, we shall have to forget that khadi has to compete with mill cloth.
('67', 316, 4, 21, 541688) Mill cloth is mill cloth and khadi is khadi.
('67', 316, 4, 22, 541733) The mill cloth producer will always concentrate on cheapening it, we must concentrate on justice and a fair wage.
('67', 316, 4, 23, 541847) There can be therefore no comparison between the two.
('67', 316, 4, 24, 541901) As regards the practical difficulties, let us reduce our establishments, let us stop advertisements, let us not patronize the private producer.
('67', 316, 4, 25, 542045) It is going to be the test of those who are pledged to khadi.
('67', 316, 4, 26, 542107) Let them produce it themselves or pay for it enough to give our brothers and sisters a living wage.
('67', 316, 4, 27, 542207) It is a question of the self purification of all khadi weavers.
('67', 316, 4, 28, 542271) Let us not forget that our mission is the service of Daridranarayana.
('67', 316, 4, 29, 542341) Difficulties there may be, but let us solve them gradually.
('67', 316, 5, 30, 542401) Harijan, 10 8 1935
('67', 316, 6, 31, 542420) 1 Mahadev Desai had concluded: It seemed to be generally agreed that the experiment must be started wherever possible and with varying but increased wages for spinners.

('67', 317, 1, 2, 542631) 498. THE BOMBAY KHADI BHANDAR
('67', 317, 2, 3, 542661) The Bombay Khadi Bhandar is the largest khadi bhandar depot of the A.I.S.A. It is no single individuals property.
('67', 317, 2, 4, 542775) It belongs to the A.I.S.A. as the sole trustees for Daridranarayana.
('67', 317, 2, 5, 542844) As such its primary concern must be Daridranarayana.
('67', 317, 2, 6, 542897) Though it has served as a means of giving honourable employment to some middle class people, it must not be regarded as an employment bureau for them.
('67', 317, 2, 7, 543048) Since a new policy is in the course of adoption, reduction is being made in the staff in keeping with the requirements of the new policy.
('67', 317, 2, 8, 543186) Hitherto extraordinary efforts have been made to push up sales of khadi sent from all parts of India and ordered by Shri Jerajani in accordance with patterns designed by his inventive genius.
('67', 317, 2, 9, 543378) But this effort meant overhead charges out of proportion to the results achieved in terms of Daridranarayana.
('67', 317, 2, 10, 543488) And it drew the attention of the provincial workers away from their main work which was to make khadi self supporting or popular in their own provinces.
('67', 317, 2, 11, 543641) The universal mission of khadi cannot be fulfilled without true provincial effort.
('67', 317, 2, 12, 543724) That can be achieved only by its distribution as faras possible in the innumerable centres of production.
('67', 317, 2, 13, 543830) No doubt some khadi will always be required for big cities like Bombay which will never produce it themselves.
('67', 317, 2, 14, 543941) That will be a healthy demand to be met without extraordinary effort.
('67', 317, 2, 15, 544011) The rich variety one sees in the city khadi shop was possible only because the Association put forth the effort to meet the varied tastes of the city public.
('67', 317, 2, 16, 544169) But time has come, if khadi is to fulfil its mission,to turn the attention towards centres of production.
('67', 317, 2, 17, 544275) They are far too few.
('67', 317, 2, 18, 544297) Every village, if not every home, has to be such a centre even as every home is a centre of production of cooked food.
('67', 317, 2, 19, 544416) The economy of the kitchen is wholly different from the economy of the books.
('67', 317, 2, 20, 544494) Even so is the economy of khadi.
('67', 317, 2, 21, 544527) The contemplated change, then, means substantial reduction in the staff of large bhandars run by or on behalf of the A.I.S.A. It also means reduction in the number, if not disappearance, of certified private producers.
('67', 317, 2, 22, 544746) How it will all be worked, it is difficult to say as yet.
('67', 317, 2, 23, 544804) It is being carefully worked out by Shri Shankerlal Banker who has been travelling throughout India for that special purpose.
('67', 317, 2, 24, 544930) But meanwhile this is to warn the lovers of khadi, the votaries of Daridranarayana, the prices of khadi must go up, greater technical skill must be developed among khadi workers, a greater spirit of self 
('67', 318, 0, 1, 545135) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 319
('67', 318, 1, 2, 545183) sacrifice must be evoked amongst all the classes connected with the production and distribution of khadi.
('67', 318, 1, 3, 545289) Sales depots have taken delight in showing a progressive decline in the prices.
('67', 318, 1, 4, 545369) I remember the time when I sold the first piece of very coarse khadi for over one rupee per yard.
('67', 318, 1, 5, 545467) Such coarse khadi will not fetch two annas today.
('67', 318, 1, 6, 545517) It is not on sale at khadi depots.
('67', 318, 1, 7, 545552) This decrease has been brought about no doubt by progressive efficiency in every department of khadi, but it has been largely purchased at the cost of the spinner.
('67', 318, 1, 8, 545716) And yet the concrete shape of Daridranarayana is the spinnerthe lowest paid labourer in all India.
('67', 318, 1, 9, 545815) It was good that the A.I.S.A. found a means of employment on the widest scale possible for the chronic unemployed at a wage, be it ever so low, even one pie per hour.
('67', 318, 1, 10, 545982) But if it is to discharge its trust, it must find at least a subsistence wage for the spinner.
('67', 318, 1, 11, 546077) Her receipt for the spinning hour should be in proportion to the amount she would need to live if she worked for eight hours a day.
('67', 318, 1, 12, 546209) What that amount is to be is not so much matter of moment, as that there must be an increase in the rate of wages earned by the spinners.
('67', 318, 1, 13, 546347) Henceforth the reports of the A.I.S.A. should state not how much reduction in the price of khadi has taken place during the period under review, but they should take pride in showing how much increase has been made in spinning wage.
('67', 318, 1, 14, 546580) It should not be satisfiedI cannot be satisfiedtill the spinners wage per hour has been put on a level with, say, the weavers.
('67', 318, 1, 15, 546707) And let the buying public remember that they are the unnamed members of that great trust and that the spinners are their wards.
('67', 318, 1, 16, 546835) Once that relation is realized there should be no difficulty in the progressive rise of khadi in the geometrical ratio.
('67', 318, 1, 17, 546955) Would that every lover of khadi will know his duty and falsify the fears of the unbelievers among khadi workers who think that the public will never pay a higher price for khadi!

('67', 320, 14, 20, 549316) Your letter.
('67', 320, 14, 21, 549329) There is no harm in using rice husked in the watermill if the grain remains unbroken.
('67', 320, 14, 22, 549415) I like it when abuse is showered on me.
('67', 320, 14, 23, 549455) Its greatest benefit is that it clears the way for better understanding.
('67', 320, 14, 24, 549528) I would far rather receive abuse than receive worship without being followed.

('67', 321, 1, 4, 549926) What can be gained by sending Krishnan under compulsion?
('67', 321, 1, 5, 549983) He came away only when he was released.
('67', 321, 1, 6, 550023) Is it not your own duty to manage the work that is being mismanaged by those to whom you entrusted it?

('67', 321, 6, 12, 550275) BHAI VALLABHBHAI, I got your letter.
('67', 321, 6, 13, 550312) After getting the Governments permission, you should publish the whole correspondence from the beginning to date.
('67', 321, 6, 14, 550426) Publish also the letter appointing the Committee 1. After doing that we should wholly concern ourselves with producing the evidence.
('67', 321, 6, 15, 550559) If Lallubhai 2 has recovered and is strong enough to do the work, it will be all right.
('67', 321, 6, 16, 550647) But I am very doubtful if he will be able to study the matter in sufficient detail.
('67', 321, 6, 17, 550731) I would be glad if Kunzru joins.
('67', 321, 6, 18, 550764) Gilder and Bahadurji, however, will suffice.
('67', 321, 6, 19, 550809) It will not matter if the third person is a little weak.
('67', 321, 6, 20, 550866) I understand about Balvantrai.
('67', 321, 6, 21, 550897) We should, however, go on doing what we think right.
('67', 321, 6, 22, 550950) I had glanced at the article in [The] Servant [of India].

('67', 322, 6, 8, 551772) Or you would not send me your mail.
('67', 322, 6, 9, 551808) You may not know that I had done nothing but secretarial work throughout my stay in South Africa.
('67', 322, 6, 10, 551906) You have therefore my sympathy.
('67', 322, 6, 11, 551938) But you will have to keep your peace and good humour in the midst of disappointments, censures from the multitude of employers.
('67', 322, 6, 12, 552066) It makes no difference that one is a volunteer or rather when one is a volunteer, one has to bear more lashes than otherwise and still say Thank you, Sir.
('67', 322, 6, 13, 552221) All the notable secretaries of the world have been made of such noble stuff.

('67', 322, 9, 21, 552628) 2. No matter how weak he is, he will use what strength he has in inflicting injury on his opponent and die in the attempt.
('67', 322, 9, 22, 552751) This is bravery but not non violence.
('67', 322, 9, 23, 552789) 3. If when his duty is to face danger, he flees, it is cowardice.

('67', 323, 11, 20, 553808) Even Panchlegaonkar 2 said that it was not particularly venomous.
('67', 323, 11, 21, 553874) It did not bite anyone even though deliberately provoked.

('67', 324, 2, 4, 554349) PREMA, I am observing two and a half hours silence today to overtake the arrears of correspondence.
('67', 324, 2, 5, 554449) Disposing of the letters one by one, I saw just now your letter of July 9, 1935. You did very well in meeting Kelkar 1. It would be good if you could take him to see your work.
('67', 324, 2, 6, 554626) What you say about work regarded as unclean is correct.
('67', 324, 2, 7, 554682) I am giving in Harijanbandhu the portion about the Mahars.
('67', 324, 2, 8, 554741) Your name will not be published.
('67', 324, 2, 9, 554774) Inform me when the Poona resolution is implemented.
('67', 324, 2, 10, 554826) Which is the other book about Hitler?
('67', 324, 3, 11, 554864) And now I come to your question.
('67', 324, 3, 12, 554897) There is great risk in taking Russia as a model to be emulated.
('67', 324, 3, 13, 554961) For one thing, we have no direct knowledge; secondly, the experiment has not yet lasted long enough; and thirdly, they rely on violence for what they are doing.
('67', 324, 3, 14, 555122) We should, therefore, leave out Russia when thinking about our problems.
('67', 324, 3, 15, 555195) This must be assumed to be common ground between us, that we do not wish to use violence to force people to do anything.
('67', 324, 3, 16, 555316) Hence the easiest way of securing justice from the rich is to see that they make the best use of the wealth they earn.
('67', 324, 3, 17, 555435) This may possibly result in their being no longer eager to acquire much wealth.
('67', 324, 3, 18, 555515) We need not mind that.
('67', 324, 3, 19, 555538) Nor need we mind, even if such a result does not follow.
('67', 324, 3, 20, 555595) We shall in this way get the use of so much wealth without having to bother about its safety.
('67', 324, 3, 21, 555689) If a large number of rich people become trustees, we shall want nothing more.
('67', 324, 3, 22, 555767) Your argument springs from the suspicion that the rich will never agree to be trustees of their own property.
('67', 324, 3, 23, 555877) We neednt worry if your suspicion is well founded, for truth is bound to triumph ultimately.
('67', 324, 3, 24, 555970) He who keeps more than he needs is a thief and stolen wealth is like unprocessed mercury.
('67', 324, 3, 25, 556060) It cannot be digested.
('67', 324, 3, 26, 556083) We should have faith that the thief will

('67', 325, 8, 14, 556998) So you also will work according to your lights.
('67', 325, 8, 15, 557046) But as there is destiny so also there is effort and since it is in our hands to make efforts, we are taught not to rely on destiny.
('67', 325, 8, 16, 557178) That is how the shloka Action alone is thy province, never the fruits thereof 2 came into being.
('67', 325, 8, 17, 557275) We can certainly put it this way: You have a right to make efforts, never to know your destiny. We should live as God ordains after making efforts.

('67', 328, 4, 6, 560352) Let me know if you can read it.
('67', 328, 4, 7, 560384) If you have any difficulty I will write to you in English.
('67', 328, 4, 8, 560443) Who are we to look after Kichi?
('67', 328, 4, 9, 560475) In the end it is God alone who will take care of him.
('67', 328, 4, 10, 560529) Nimu is here with me these days.
('67', 328, 4, 11, 560562) Kano is ill.
('67', 328, 4, 12, 560575) He has grown very weak.
('67', 328, 4, 13, 560599) Lakshmi has gone to Bardoli.

('67', 328, 4, 19, 560847) The honey is also good.
('67', 328, 4, 20, 560871) Send fruit and honey whenever you wish to, but they should be cheap because I need them daily.
('67', 328, 4, 21, 560966) My diet is milk, neem and some other leaves and fruit.

('67', 329, 4, 8, 561768) I dont get even a minute free.
('67', 329, 4, 9, 561799) Harilal spends the whole day immersed in a tub of liquor, so to say.
('67', 329, 4, 10, 561868) All our hopes about his having been reformed are falsified.
('67', 329, 4, 11, 561928) He is now worse than he was.
('67', 329, 4, 12, 561957) But one keeps on hoping as long as one breathes.
('67', 329, 4, 13, 562006) Accordingly, let us hope that, if he lives, some day he will reform himself.

('67', 330, 3, 8, 562915) I will try and manage somehow without him.
('67', 330, 3, 9, 562958) Rajkumari and Khurshed are helping as much as they can.
('67', 330, 3, 10, 563014) The former disposes of most of the English correspondence.
('67', 330, 3, 11, 563073) She will leave on the 21st.
('67', 330, 3, 12, 563101) Khurshedbehn will remain here for the present.
('67', 330, 3, 13, 563148) Rajendrababu left today.
('67', 330, 3, 14, 563173) He was, as usual, accompanied by Mathurababu and Gorakhbabu.
('67', 330, 3, 15, 563234) The astronomer is leaving for that side this evening.
('67', 330, 3, 16, 563288) If necessary, take fourteen instead of seven doses of the powder, but see that you completely get rid of the jaundice.
('67', 330, 3, 17, 563407) Never leave a job half done.
('67', 330, 3, 18, 563436) Your buying a second class ticket for Andrews was all right.
('67', 330, 3, 19, 563497) You could feed him well there because we starved him here.
('67', 330, 3, 20, 563556) If we had fed him here, too, he would have been laid up in bed, as he was in Allahabad.

('67', 331, 12, 25, 565247) But she does not wish at all to leave this place.

('67', 331, 12, 27, 565356) Being hard working, she learns things quickly.
('67', 331, 12, 28, 565403) She does not wish to exchange the certain for the uncertain.

('67', 333, 1, 2, 566956) 524. DECENTRALIZATION?
('67', 333, 2, 3, 566979) Before the forthcoming meeting (on 30th instant) of the executive of the Harijan Sevak Sangh Board, among the many important questions for discussion, will be that of the need for decentralization which some provincial boards have felt for the sake of the better advancement of its object.
('67', 333, 2, 4, 567269) Centralization was insisted upon by Sheth Ghanshyamdas Birla and Shri Amritlal Thakkar for the decisive reason that money was found by the Centre, the Presidents of the Provincial Boards were selected by Sheth Ghanshyamdas, and the policy was also evolved by the Central Board.
('67', 333, 2, 5, 567547) Though I have concurred in the policy of centralization I have always desired, as I have no doubt the Board, too, has desired, decentralization at the first opportunity.
('67', 333, 2, 6, 567717) But that could only be done when the Provincial Boards were ready and able to raise their own funds.
('67', 333, 2, 7, 567818) I would love nothing so much as that every village had its Harijan Board and was able to find its own funds.
('67', 333, 2, 8, 567927) When that day comes, it will also be one of complete abolition of untouchability in every shape and form.
('67', 333, 2, 9, 568033) For the present it has to be unfortunately admitted that the cause is still led by a handful of earnest reformers scattered all over the country.
('67', 333, 2, 10, 568179) Not all of them are able to raise funds locally nor are they all sure of the policy to be followed.
('67', 333, 2, 11, 568279) I use the word policy deliberately.
('67', 333, 2, 12, 568315) For while everyone knows the goal, everyone does not know the grave limitations under which the reformer labours.
('67', 333, 2, 13, 568429) The slightest error of judgment, a hasty action or a hasty word may put back the hands of the clock of progress.
('67', 333, 2, 14, 568542) Policies have, therefore, to be cautiously evolved in the light of experiences daily gained by the few who have no other thought but that of serving Harijans and ridding Hinduism of its greatest blot.
('67', 333, 2, 15, 568743) Harijan workers will be grieved to learn that there are more than Rs. 80,000 as advances to Provincial Boards in the books of the Central Office.
('67', 333, 2, 16, 568889) This has a tale to tell.
('67', 333, 2, 17, 568914) Those Boards against whom the money stand have not been able to find their quota.
('67', 333, 2, 18, 568996) It is also a grievous fact that not all the Boards have sent in their returns in accordance with the prescribed manner.
('67', 333, 2, 19, 569116) The third thing to note is that in spite of the ceaseless vigilance of the Secretaries and their tours, the district
('67', 334, 0, 1, 569233) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 335
('67', 334, 1, 2, 569281) organizations have not functioned as they might have done.
('67', 334, 1, 3, 569340) This is not to say that workers in the provinces and districts have nothing to their credit.
('67', 334, 1, 4, 569433) Indeed the columns of Harijan have abundantly shown, what amazing progress the cause has made during the very short period that the Boards have functioned.
('67', 334, 1, 5, 569589) But just now my purpose is to examine the debit side so as to enable interested workers to come to a right decision.
('67', 334, 1, 6, 569706) It may be that the defects to which I have drawn attention are due to the policy of overcentralization.
('67', 334, 1, 7, 569810) If it be so, the advocates of decentralization have to prove their case.
('67', 334, 1, 8, 569883) Had the Centre felt the need, it would have come long ago.
('67', 334, 1, 9, 569942) The forthcoming meeting is that of the executive of the Board.
('67', 334, 1, 10, 570005) It consists of seven members of whom the Chairman is absent.
('67', 334, 1, 11, 570066) I would invite the Harijan sevaks throughout the provinces to send their considered opinion to the Secretaries at Delhi supporting them as briefly as they can with facts and figures.
('67', 334, 1, 12, 570249) After all in a cause so humanitarian as that of Harijans involving the very existence of an ancient faith, nothing should be left undone that would advance it.
('67', 334, 1, 13, 570409) Personal considerations do not count in such matters.

('67', 334, 3, 15, 570482) 525. COMPOST MANURE
('67', 334, 4, 16, 570502) There is in Indore an Institute of Plant Industry.
('67', 334, 4, 17, 570553) It issues from time to time leaflets for those whom it is designed to serve.
('67', 334, 4, 18, 570630) The first one of these describes the utility and the method of preparing compost manure from farm wastes.
('67', 334, 4, 19, 570736) As it is valuable for Harijans and village workers who handle cattle dung and night soil, I copy below practically the whole of the leaflet 1 incorporating footnotes into the running description of the process.

('67', 334, 6, 21, 570966) 526. SNAKE POISONING
('67', 334, 7, 22, 570987) Dr. Sokhey, Director of Haffkine Institute, has kindly supplied me with a note on Indian snakes.
('67', 334, 7, 23, 571084) As co workers are spreading out in villages, it becomes necessary to arm them with information in matters of common occurrence in villages where city conveniences are
('67', 334, 8, 24, 571251) 1 Not reproduced here; it appeared, in parts, in this and the following issue of Harijan.
('67', 335, 0, 1, 571341) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 336
('67', 335, 1, 2, 571383) unfortunately unavailable.
('67', 335, 1, 3, 571410) The most dangerous is snakebite which proves fatal in many cases if the necessary measures are not immediately adopted.
('67', 335, 1, 4, 571530) I give below the important portions of the note 1. The whole contains useful information about identification of snakes.
('67', 335, 1, 5, 571651) But the description is too technical for the village worker to follow.
('67', 335, 1, 6, 571722) I am, therefore, omitting this part of the note.
('67', 335, 1, 7, 571771) Since nine tenths of snakes are non poisonous and are valuable protectors of fields against rats, etc., it would be a good thing if a simple key for distinguishing poisonous from non poisonous snakes can be had.
('67', 335, 1, 8, 571983) Meanwhile let those interested study the very simple remedy described below: 2
('67', 335, 2, 9, 572062) Though Col.
('67', 335, 2, 10, 572074) Sokhey has warned me that there is no sure remedy against bites of poisonous snakes except injections of antivenom serum, I cannot resist giving the remedy claimed to have been succesfully tried by Just, the author of Return to Nature.
('67', 335, 2, 11, 572310) I have tried it successfully in two or three cases of snake bites and numerous cases of scorpion stings.
('67', 335, 2, 12, 572415) It consists in applying an ample earth bandage to the affected part.
('67', 335, 2, 13, 572484) Take as much clean earth as possible, add cold water to it and make a cold poultice of it.
('67', 335, 2, 14, 572575) Spread the composition an inch as a pack on a wet linen piece, fold, apply and bandage.
('67', 335, 2, 15, 572663) If it is a toe that is bitten, the leg should have the poultice up to the knee, if a finger, the whole area should be bandaged, the more the better.
('67', 335, 2, 16, 572812) All the other treatment as described in the foregoing note should undoubtedly be taken.
('67', 335, 2, 17, 572900) And if the serum injection is taken, the earth treatment may be quite superfluous.
('67', 335, 2, 18, 572983) I was assured that if the injection was given in time, it was a sure antidote.
('67', 335, 2, 19, 573062) Nor can I vouch for the absolute efficacy of the earth treatment.
('67', 335, 2, 20, 573128) For I have no knowledge that the bites treated by me were highly poisonous.
('67', 335, 2, 21, 573204) I suggest the earth treatment as being harmless and most easily available in villages and as being highly acclaimed by its author.

('67', 336, 12, 15, 574072) Even so, your labour in thinking on those subjects and writing the articles will not be altogether wasted.
('67', 336, 12, 16, 574179) What shall I say to Chi.

('67', 336, 12, 18, 574215) Vinoba will see what should be done about him.
('67', 336, 12, 19, 574262) I cannot interfere with the running of that Ashram.
('67', 336, 12, 20, 574314) I know, however that Vallabh has to carry heavy enough burden in managing the Nalwadi Ashram.

('67', 337, 3, 4, 574614) NARANDAS, What shall we do about Harilal?
('67', 337, 3, 5, 574656) He is suspicious about everything and considers himself innocent.
('67', 337, 3, 6, 574722) I hope he does not create scandal in Junagadh.
('67', 337, 3, 7, 574769) I am indeed very glad that you are fully satisfied with Mathew.
('67', 337, 3, 8, 574833) If he devotes himself whole heartedly to his work, he will make a name for himself in Rajkot itself.
('67', 337, 3, 9, 574934) When you are fully convinced, you may pay him more if you can.
('67', 337, 3, 10, 574997) In any case, you must give him physical work to do.
('67', 337, 3, 11, 575049) And also he must learn Hindi.
('67', 337, 3, 12, 575079) Send the money which they have asked for from Sabarmati.
('67', 337, 3, 13, 575136) Send me Vajubhais address which he has given in his last letter.
('67', 337, 3, 14, 575201) I need it.
('67', 337, 3, 15, 575212) I have not yet been able to write to him.

('67', 337, 3, 19, 575349) Superfine khadi dhotis are available now.
('67', 337, 3, 20, 575391) If he himself would spin fine yarn, he can have a dhoti made at low cost.
('67', 337, 3, 21, 575465) There is no reason at all for relieving him.
('67', 337, 3, 22, 575510) I liked his letter.

('67', 337, 8, 30, 575842) Neither am I a guru nor are you a disciple.
('67', 337, 8, 31, 575886) I have never made anyone my disciple.
('67', 337, 8, 32, 575924) I hope you know this.
('67', 337, 8, 33, 575946) I find a sort of listlessness in your questions.

('67', 338, 2, 3, 576249) For nearly a year a lady has been doing welfare work in a village.
('67', 338, 2, 4, 576316) She is gradually making some headway.
('67', 338, 2, 5, 576354) She has already crossed some huge hurdles.
('67', 338, 2, 6, 576397) She ploughs with the farmers plough share, cleans roads and teaches women how to spin.
('67', 338, 2, 7, 576484) She is teaching the young and the old.
('67', 338, 2, 8, 576523) From among the experiences which she had, I give below 1 a recent one as it is a very useful one.
('67', 338, 3, 9, 576621) The Chamars would not take a goats carcass as it had been touched by a Mahar .
('67', 338, 3, 10, 576700) To take it to the Mangs I put the basket on my head.
('67', 338, 3, 11, 576753) When I started to walk people stared at me.
('67', 338, 3, 12, 576797) I went straight to the Mangs and they took the carcass.
('67', 338, 3, 13, 576853) They said, why did you carry it?
('67', 338, 3, 14, 576886) If you had told us, we would have fetched it. I replied, I wanted to show that no work is dirty; I was not ashamed of this job.
('67', 338, 3, 15, 577014) So why should I trouble you? This instance shows that nothing is accomplished through speeches, but that results can be obtained by our actually doing what we wish others to do.

('67', 339, 4, 5, 578021) I sent you some hand made paper.
('67', 339, 4, 6, 578054) You must have received it.

('67', 339, 4, 8, 578107) Indigenous reeds and ink are freely available in Rajkot.
('67', 339, 4, 9, 578164) Vohras stock both.
('67', 339, 4, 10, 578183) Such things neednt be sent from here.
('67', 339, 4, 11, 578221) Reeds grow in our fields.
('67', 339, 4, 12, 578247) Some types of them, which are strong and beautiful in appearance, do not grow in all places.
('67', 339, 4, 13, 578340) But bamboos are found everywhere.
('67', 339, 4, 14, 578374) I remember that when we were children we brothers used to make bamboo pens just for the pleasure of seeing if we could make them.
('67', 339, 4, 15, 578504) And we didnt have any thing but reed pens at home.
('67', 339, 4, 16, 578555) The steel pens entered our home after we had joined the English School.
('67', 339, 4, 17, 578627) We used to compete among ouerselves in using the two.

('67', 339, 10, 23, 578881) Your letter narrates a painful story.
('67', 339, 10, 24, 578919) In this particular instance, the newspapers have not exaggerated but on the contrary have understated [the facts].
('67', 339, 10, 25, 579034) You did perfectly well in seeking the help of the authorities.
('67', 339, 10, 26, 579097) The persecutors must be punished.
('67', 339, 10, 27, 579131) There will be minimum violence in that.
('67', 339, 10, 28, 579171) As long as the number and strength of the non violent are limited, violence by the State will be the smallest evil.
('67', 339, 10, 29, 579287) However, even while seeking the help of the authorities, you should continue to adopt other measures of your own.
('67', 339, 10, 30, 579401) Is there nobody who can have some influence on the Rajputs and the Baraiyas?
('67', 339, 10, 31, 579478) One of us must stay among the Harijans.

('67', 341, 8, 12, 581471) Have you taken any step?
('67', 341, 8, 13, 581496) Kishorelal told me yesterday that you had an acute attack of piles which had even started bleeding, and that an operation had become necessary.
('67', 341, 8, 14, 581640) This is the result of putting up with chronic constipation for so long.
('67', 341, 8, 15, 581712) Send me full details.
('67', 341, 8, 16, 581734) In your present state of health, an operation doesnt seem advisable either.
('67', 341, 8, 17, 581810) It would, therefore, be better if you could avoid it.
('67', 341, 8, 18, 581864) I would advise you to consult Gaurishankar or Dr. Mehta 2. Perhaps the former may be of real help.
('67', 341, 8, 19, 581963) Many persons find it possible to avoid an operation by improving their digestion.

('67', 342, 10, 27, 583592) The ultimate responsibility is mine.
('67', 342, 10, 28, 583629) Do take porridge.
('67', 342, 10, 29, 583647) The effects caused by roti could have been caused by the oil used in its preparation.

('67', 344, 8, 12, 585052) August 21, 1935
('67', 344, 9, 13, 585068) Althought I have never thought in such terms as presented by you, now that I am challenged my first thought is that belief in mans freedom is wholly unnecessary for conducting the highest type of activity.
('67', 344, 9, 14, 585274) But to answer your second question, I have always reconciled comparative freedom of the individual with the all powerfulness of the Supreme Will.
('67', 344, 9, 15, 585420) I came to that conclusion on observing some ordinary experience of life.
('67', 344, 9, 16, 585493) A prisoner, even in a solitary cell, has freedom of movement, however little it may be, and he has complete freedom of the mind.
('67', 344, 9, 17, 585622) In the question presented by you, even the mind is prisoner under the Supreme Will, and yet He permits us to think millions of idle thoughts.
('67', 344, 9, 18, 585764) Hence I conclude that there is some freedom left to the individual, be it the tiniest conceivable.
('67', 344, 9, 19, 585863) The acid test of complete obedience to the Universal Will would be full surrender even of that tiny freedom.

('67', 345, 13, 22, 586850) WARDHA, August 22, 1935 BHAI KAKUBHAI,
('67', 345, 14, 23, 586889) I have your letter.
('67', 345, 14, 24, 586909) I for one am satisfied by your reply.
('67', 345, 14, 25, 586947) Since you are keen I will read Ratubhais letter so that justice is done to him.
('67', 345, 14, 26, 587027) Actually, the letter is not even meant for me.
('67', 345, 14, 27, 587074) It is not for me to do justice to Ratubhai or anybody else.
('67', 345, 14, 28, 587134) Here doing justice to Ratubhai only means that I should not entertain any unjust thought about him
('67', 346, 0, 1, 587233) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 347
('67', 346, 1, 2, 587281) even in my mind.
('67', 346, 1, 3, 587298) Ratubhai seems to be making a great mistake.
('67', 346, 1, 4, 587343) The judgment about his Sevak Sangh has already been given.
('67', 346, 1, 5, 587402) The personal matter has therefore ended there.
('67', 346, 1, 6, 587449) During that inquiry Ratubhai talked about the whole management of the Bhandar.
('67', 346, 1, 7, 587528) I suggested an inquiry.
('67', 346, 1, 8, 587552) Even if I had not done so, it was my duty as President to inquire into the matter.
('67', 346, 1, 9, 587635) Ratubhais resigning does not absolve him from his duty of co operating in the inquiry.
('67', 346, 1, 10, 587722) But that is a matter for him to consider.
('67', 346, 1, 11, 587764) Ratubhai in his letters keeps himself in the centre and not the improvement of the Bhandar, that is, the interest of khadi.
('67', 346, 1, 12, 587888) And by doing so he is making himself miserable.
('67', 346, 1, 13, 587936) I do not have to think about anything except the policy of the Bhandar and the interest of khadi.
('67', 346, 1, 14, 588034) It is not therefore my duty at present to go through his letters.
('67', 346, 1, 15, 588100) When you have completed your inquiry and made your recommendations I will definitely think about the matter if necessary and if I feel that injustice has been done to Ratubhai and others.
('67', 346, 1, 16, 588288) It is good that you feel that both Vithaldas 1 and Ratubhai may be right.
('67', 346, 1, 17, 588362) In fact the truth may lie somewhere else altogether.
('67', 346, 1, 18, 588415) But God alone knows it.
('67', 346, 1, 19, 588439) Ratubhai sees the episode from one point of view and Vithaldas from another.
('67', 346, 1, 20, 588516) From their respective paints of view, both may be right.
('67', 346, 1, 21, 588573) If you wish you may certainly show this letter to Ratubhai.
('67', 346, 1, 22, 588633) I tried all means available to me to satisfy him.
('67', 346, 1, 23, 588683) I troubled Kishorelal in whom he has faith.
('67', 346, 1, 24, 588727) I asked you to intervene, because he has faith in you, too.
('67', 346, 1, 25, 588787) Finally Mahadev felt that he could help him and he also lent a hand.
('67', 346, 1, 26, 588856) If I cannot satisfy him with all this, then I suppose that is fate.
('67', 346, 1, 27, 588924) In trying to satisfy him or anybody else my interest can only be the good of Daridranarayana.
('67', 346, 1, 28, 589018) I can think of nothing else but that.

('67', 347, 2, 3, 589319) [August 22/23, 1935] 2
('67', 347, 3, 4, 589342) GANDHIJI: Let us realize our amazing limitations.
('67', 347, 3, 5, 589392) Do not mind even if we have to be like the three tailors of Tooley Street.
('67', 347, 3, 6, 589467) Our resources are few and limited.
('67', 347, 3, 7, 589502) We cannot afford to squander money on high sounding schemes and we cannot adopt any and every means.
('67', 347, 3, 8, 589603) We may fail to get workers and agents, and our branches may have to be few and far between.
('67', 347, 3, 9, 589695) But I am in no hurry to see a network of institutions all over the country.
('67', 347, 3, 10, 589771) Ours is a policy of ploughing a lonely furrow .
('67', 347, 3, 11, 589819) If we find that it is not possible for any industry to pay this minimum living wage, we had better close our shop.
('67', 347, 3, 12, 589934) We should see that in any industry that we handle the wage covers a reasonable maintenance allowance.
('67', 347, 4, 13, 590036) PRAFULLA: When I was an official earning a salary, I used to calculate how much my servants, including their dependants, would need for a fair maintenance and I used to pay them accordingly.
('67', 347, 4, 14, 590227) It used to come to Rs. 20 a month.
('67', 347, 4, 15, 590262) With clothing and other needs, it would come to Rs. 30.
('67', 347, 5, 16, 590318) GANDHIJI (laughingly): Then if you like we shall have a rupee a day as the minimum wage for Bengal.
('67', 347, 5, 17, 590418) What you used to do as an official you have now to do as a member of the Association.
('67', 347, 5, 18, 590504) I would certainly have the wage as high as possible and include in it the maintenance of at least one dependant.
('67', 347, 5, 19, 590617) But you will go as far as you can.
('67', 347, 6, 20, 590652) Vaikuntha Mehta, who is the Managing Director of the Provincial Co operative Bank in Bombay, had not the slightest doubt that the sooner we tackled the question the better; for, when we insisted on an adequate solution of the wage question and that of work in organized large scale industries, it was our duty to attend to these question in case of unorganized industries.
('67', 347, 6, 21, 591025) There were obvious difficulties, but he had no doubt that the moment people were made to see that ninety per cent or more of the rupee that the people spend on an article they purchase goes directly into the pocket of the man who has produced it, they would not grudge to pay the money.
('67', 347, 7, 22, 591312) Shankerlal Banker emphasized the importance of collecting data, from different provinces, of the prices of the minimum articles of a balanced diet, but he had some difficulty in applying the wage question to existing industries.
('67', 347, 8, 23, 591541) 1 The discussion is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 347, 8, 24, 591606) The Management Board of the All India Village Industries Association met at Wardha.
('67', 347, 8, 25, 591690) 2 From The Searchlight, 30 8 1935
('67', 348, 0, 1, 591724) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 349
('67', 348, 1, 2, 591772) Gandhiji made it clear that we were exclusively concerned with dead or dying industries which we were trying to revive and we were not going to disturb the existing industries.
('67', 348, 1, 3, 591949) Was the minimum wage likely to make matters difficult for the villager?
('67', 348, 1, 4, 592021) What about the little articles of the villagers daily need, earthen pots and lamps, for instance?
('67', 348, 1, 5, 592119) Because the townspeople were to pay a higher price for those articles, were the villagers also to pay that higher price?
('67', 348, 1, 6, 592240) Already villagers in villages in close proximity to towns were paying a higher price for milk than those in distant villages.
('67', 348, 1, 7, 592366) Gandhiji said: That was inevitable.
('67', 348, 1, 8, 592402) But the villagers among themselves will adjust the prices.
('67', 348, 1, 9, 592461) Besides, when our organization is in good running order, the carpenter and the smith and the weaver and the spinner, who purchase from the potter at the minimum wage price, will have also had their minimum wage price for their respective wares, and they wont grudge the poor potter his price.
('67', 348, 1, 10, 592754) But that is a distant goal.
('67', 348, 1, 11, 592782) Let us at the present moment content ourselves with things that pass out of villages to the towns and let us refuse to have them at anything less than the minimum living wage price.

('67', 349, 3, 10, 594328) If you convert the bones into manure, there is bound to be a demand for it.
('67', 349, 3, 11, 594404) In every village collect the bones in one place, roast them slightly as explained in Harijan 1 and then grind it into fine powder.
('67', 349, 3, 12, 594535) You can then dispatch that powder wherever necessary.
('67', 349, 3, 13, 594589) You can sell it to the Agriculture Department of the State.
('67', 349, 3, 14, 594649) It can be stored indefinitely for it does not get spoiled.
('67', 349, 3, 15, 594708) How to convert the flesh into manure has also been explained in Harijan.
('67', 349, 3, 16, 594781) Money for this is provided by a certain big firm.
('67', 349, 3, 17, 594831) The process of converting flesh into manure is more difficult than that of making bone powder, but it is such as can be carried out at home.
('67', 349, 3, 18, 594972) I will get a detailed copy of the explanation made and send it to you.
('67', 349, 3, 19, 595043) The guts can be converted into nets.
('67', 349, 3, 20, 595080) Jethalal does it.
('67', 349, 3, 21, 595098) There is no part of a carcass which cannot be utilized in some way or other.
('67', 349, 3, 22, 595175) Even blood can be utilized, but I do not remember the process.
('67', 349, 3, 23, 595238) I will ask and find out.
('67', 349, 3, 24, 595263) I have not yet been able to complete the arrangements.
('67', 349, 3, 25, 595318) When they are completed, I hope to be able to create a permanent demand for the materials.
('67', 349, 3, 26, 595409) The bone manure or the other things need not be sent out of Kathiawar.
('67', 349, 3, 27, 595480) We can sell the materials at low prices to cultivators whom we can persuade to buy them, for the cost of production is bound to be very low at present.
('67', 349, 3, 28, 595632) If Mathew cannot be steady even there, I shall be helpless.
('67', 349, 3, 29, 595692) I have taken much trouble for him.
('67', 349, 3, 30, 595727) I understand about Rama.
('67', 349, 3, 31, 595752) I am satisfied if the children are growing properly.
('67', 349, 3, 32, 595805) Ba is in Delhi.
('67', 349, 3, 33, 595821) She has been through a severe illness.

('67', 350, 2, 3, 596094) August 23, 1935
('67', 350, 3, 4, 596110) LILAVATI,
('67', 350, 4, 5, 596120) If you leave some space below the questions in your exercises, it will be easier for you to study my comments.
('67', 350, 4, 6, 596231) The questions should be serially numbered.
('67', 350, 4, 7, 596274) I will indicates the future tense.
('67', 350, 4, 8, 596309) In the second and the third person would expresses desire.
('67', 350, 4, 9, 596368) Apply this rule whenever you find these words used in the lesson you read.
('67', 350, 4, 10, 596443) 1. If and will can be used in the same sentence.
('67', 350, 4, 11, 596492) If is a conjunction and will a verb in this context.
('67', 350, 4, 12, 596545) 2. You will have received my letter. I hope you are happy. 3. Though you are good, yet will I not hurt you. There is very little difference between still and yet.
('67', 350, 4, 13, 596708) 4. He must be punished means He ought to be punished.
('67', 350, 4, 14, 596762) He shall have been punished means He must certainly have been punished.
('67', 350, 4, 15, 596834) There is not much difference between must and shall have.
('67', 350, 4, 16, 596892) Shall in the second or the third person can have the force of must.
('67', 350, 5, 17, 596960) 6. Though and yet or still are used in the same sentence.
('67', 350, 5, 18, 597018) Yet and still complete the sense of though.
('67', 350, 5, 19, 597062) I hope you will be able to understand all the answers.
('67', 350, 5, 20, 597117) If you do not understand any of them, do not hesitate to ask again.

('67', 351, 2, 3, 597385) August 23, 1935
('67', 351, 3, 4, 597401) NARAHARI,
('67', 351, 4, 5, 597411) Though your letter of the 18th has been lying before me for the last two days, I could read it only today.
('67', 351, 4, 6, 597518) I like Bhai Velchands intention.
('67', 351, 4, 7, 597551) Let a few wells be dug and tablets put up with Pandyas name inscribed on them.
('67', 351, 4, 8, 597630) Really speaking, however, his name can be fittingly associated only with a task accomplished with the greatest difficulty.
('67', 351, 4, 9, 597753) Velchand should leave the implementation to us.
('67', 351, 4, 10, 597801) Let the Pandya Village Uplift Fund immortalize both itself and Pandya, as the Tilak Swaraj Fund has immortalized itself and the Lokamanya.
('67', 351, 4, 11, 597940) The sum that Velchand wishes to spend will partly fulfil that aim.
('67', 351, 4, 12, 598007) At present we would not be able to use a larger sum than that.
('67', 351, 4, 13, 598070) This, however, may be your and my view.
('67', 351, 4, 14, 598110) I had a talk with Sardar.
('67', 351, 4, 15, 598136) He has not been able to decide.
('67', 351, 4, 16, 598168) He was to write to Velchand.
('67', 351, 4, 17, 598197) He will decide after doing that and let me know.
('67', 351, 4, 18, 598246) We shall have to wait till then.
('67', 351, 4, 19, 598279) The dairy seems to be going on very well there.
('67', 351, 4, 20, 598327) How do you use the milk?
('67', 351, 4, 21, 598352) Mahadev told me the Bhagat story.
('67', 351, 4, 22, 598386) It seems a very strange affair.
('67', 351, 4, 23, 598418) I heard about Ratilal, too.
('67', 351, 4, 24, 598446) Your hands are quite full, it seems.
('67', 351, 4, 25, 598483) Why has Surendra gone there?

('67', 352, 2, 3, 598709) August 23, 1935
('67', 352, 3, 4, 598725) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('67', 352, 4, 5, 598743) I drafted the terms 1 immediately yesterday and the draft is being sent with Vaikunth.
('67', 352, 4, 6, 598830) I have also discussed the matter with him.
('67', 352, 4, 7, 598873) I am returning the cutting from Sanj.
('67', 352, 4, 8, 598911) This sort of agitation is sure to be intensified still more.
('67', 352, 4, 9, 598972) We shall be free from the bother as soon as the committee starts functioning.
('67', 352, 4, 10, 599050) The Civil Surgeon is somewhat alarmed by Kumarappas low fever.
('67', 352, 4, 11, 599113) He has advised that we should get him examined in Bombay.
('67', 352, 4, 12, 599171) He will arrive there in two or three days.
('67', 352, 4, 13, 599214) Afterwards I am thinking of sending him to Simla.
('67', 352, 4, 14, 599264) An invitation has been received from Rajkumari.
('67', 352, 4, 15, 599312) Get Kumarappa examined by Jivraj.
('67', 352, 4, 16, 599346) Since you are there, I am not writing to anybody else.
('67', 352, 4, 17, 599401) I suggested to him that he should stay with you, but he is being dragged away by Shoorji who is here.
('67', 352, 4, 18, 599503) Sahani has advised that we should get Kumarappas throat and lungs examined.
('67', 352, 4, 19, 599579) If you have been able to come to any decision regarding the donation contemplated by Velchand, let me know.
('67', 352, 4, 20, 599687) His letter to Narahari is enclosed.
('67', 352, 4, 21, 599723) I still feel that a part of the sum may be used for digging some wells, as desired by Velchand, and that the whole of the remaining amount should be spent for village reconstruction.
('67', 352, 4, 22, 599906) You may, if you wish, restrict the expenditure to Gujarat.
('67', 352, 4, 23, 599965) Give me your own independent views, however.
('67', 352, 5, 24, 600010) If you have come to any decision regarding Vithalbhais money also, let me know it.
('67', 352, 5, 25, 600093) The letter to Motilal 3 was excellent.

('67', 353, 2, 3, 600410) HARIJANNATTAR PROBLEM This problem is ever with us.
('67', 353, 2, 4, 600462) I have before me a long report sent by a worker in the black area.
('67', 353, 2, 5, 600529) It shows that the Nattars are not much better than before.
('67', 353, 2, 6, 600588) What improvement there is, is due not to conviction or enlightenment.
('67', 353, 2, 7, 600658) It is largely due to the fear of prosecution against the Nattars for the harm they may do to the Harijans, and it is also due to the good work done by the Harijan Sevak Sanghs workers among the Harijans.
('67', 353, 2, 8, 600862) They have somewhat succeeded in their effort to lessen the Harijans fear of the Nattars.
('67', 353, 2, 9, 600951) Permanent improvement is possible only if, as the report suggests, there is steady education spread both among Harijans and Nattars.
('67', 353, 2, 10, 601084) The latter need perhaps more enlightenment than the former.
('67', 353, 2, 11, 601144) Their unspeakable intolerance is due not so much to viciousness as it certainly is to unpardonable ignorance among them.
('67', 353, 2, 12, 601265) Therefore the Sangh has to continue its labours undismayed by difficulties no matter how grave they may appear to be.
('67', 353, 2, 13, 601383) If their faith survives them, it is sure to triumph.
('67', 353, 3, 14, 601436) NOT BOUND Some weavers of Piplav, Bhadran Taluka, Baroda State, write to say that two years ago they resolved to give up carrion eating and to that end gave up carrying and flaying carcasses.
('67', 353, 3, 15, 601628) But the tanners and the Bhangis of the village have been doing that work.
('67', 353, 3, 16, 601702) The Patidars of the village would not tolerate what they thought was presumption on the weavers part and proclaimed a severe boycott of them, cutting off all social services.
('67', 353, 3, 17, 601877) They polluted their well, and began throwing stones on their roofs.
('67', 353, 3, 18, 601945) The writers ask for guidance.
('67', 353, 3, 19, 601975) The Baroda State is well known for its enlightened policy about untouchability.
('67', 353, 3, 20, 602055) I trust that the authorities will go out of their way to save these helpless Harijans whenever they are persecuted by the so called caste Hindus.
('67', 353, 3, 21, 602201) It is also up to the many reformers of advanced Bhadran to befriend these poor weavers and persuade the Patidars of Piplav to desist from the reported ill treatment of its weavers.
('67', 353, 3, 22, 602382) The latter deserve congratulations on their having given up carrion eating.
('67', 353, 3, 23, 602458) They need not have, on that account, given up the carrying and flaying of dead cattle, which is a lucrative and honourable calling and a necessary social service.
('67', 353, 3, 24, 602621) But they are in no way bound to do the carrying or the flaying.
('67', 353, 3, 25, 602685) If an honourable calling is regarded as
('67', 354, 0, 1, 602725) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 355
('67', 354, 1, 2, 602773) degrading, the responsibility for its being so regarded lies on savarna Hindus.
('67', 354, 1, 3, 602853) No wonder if the weavers of Piplav, having become conscious of their degradation and being determined to get rid of it, decided to give up a calling that had led to their being regarded as degraded people.
('67', 354, 1, 4, 603059) It is well for the village of Piplav that it has tanners and scavengers who, not having attained class consciousness, are yet doing carcass carrying and flaying, which society wrongly considers degrading.
('67', 354, 1, 5, 603264) The whole social structure must crumble to pieces if the so called higher classes do not realize the obvious duty of abolishing the evil custom of considering any class of persons as lower than themselves.
('67', 354, 1, 6, 603470) But, while that consummation is being reached, it is the duty of the authorities and the reformers to do everything in theirpower to protect the Harijans against the cruel treatment to which the poor weavers of Piplav are said to be subjected.
('67', 354, 2, 7, 603714) UNTRUTHFUL ADVERTISEMENTS The other day I drew attention 1 to indecent advertising.
('67', 354, 2, 8, 603798) A Calcutta correspondent now sends me cuttings from well known newspapers of advertisement which I would call untruthful.
('67', 354, 2, 9, 603920) Just now a very vigorous propaganda seems to be going on in Bengal and probably in the other provinces also in favour of drinking Indian tea.
('67', 354, 2, 10, 604062) The following is the translation sent by the correspondent of an advertisement in Bengali:
('67', 354, 3, 11, 604153) TEA DRINKING AND YOUTHFUL LOOK
('67', 354, 4, 12, 604184) JALPAIGURI, May 15
('67', 354, 5, 13, 604203) That tea helps retain youthful look and energy long is, it appears, demonstrated from the experience of Shrijut Nepal Chandra Bhattacharya.
('67', 354, 5, 14, 604343) He is now forty eight, but he looks no older than thirty four.
('67', 354, 5, 15, 604406) He maintains that this youthful look of his is due to his taking tea.
('67', 354, 5, 16, 604476) He had his first cup of tea when he was fourteen.
('67', 354, 5, 17, 604526) Since then he has been a regular tea drinker, and since the year before last he has been taking more or less thirty cups of tea daily.
('67', 354, 5, 18, 604661) In this respect he has a peculiarity all his own.
('67', 354, 5, 19, 604711) He does not take tea immediately it is prepared, nor does he sip in the whole of it, but rejects a little at the bottom.
('67', 354, 5, 20, 604832) He takes from six to ten cups of it at a time.
('67', 354, 5, 21, 604879) This is a specimen of many such and reads as if it were a report from the papers own correspondent.
('67', 354, 5, 22, 604979) It advances a claim for tea drinking which has no support in human experience anywhere.
('67', 354, 5, 23, 605067) On the contrary even those who advocate tea drinking advise extreme

('67', 355, 0, 1, 605179) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 356
('67', 355, 1, 2, 605221) moderation.
('67', 355, 1, 3, 605233) We should be no worse off if there was no tea drunk in India.
('67', 355, 1, 4, 605295) But unfortunately tea and such other so called harmless drinks have come to stay in our midst.
('67', 355, 1, 5, 605390) My plea is for due regard for truth in advertising.
('67', 355, 1, 6, 605442) It is a habit with people, especially in India, to treat the printed word in a book or a newspaper as gospel truth.
('67', 355, 1, 7, 605558) There is need, therefore, for extreme caution in drawing up advertisements.
('67', 355, 1, 8, 605634) Untruths such as my correspondent has drawn attention to are most dangerous.
('67', 355, 1, 9, 605711) To drink thirty cups of tea per day not only does not refresh the body or the mind but weakens digestion and enervates the drinker.
('67', 355, 1, 10, 605843) One or two cups of weak tea per day is about as much as the human body can accommodate, perhaps, without harm.
('67', 355, 1, 11, 605954) In India the tea leaves are actually boiled so as to draw all the tannin they may contain.
('67', 355, 1, 12, 606045) Any doctor would testify that tannin is bad for the stomach.
('67', 355, 1, 13, 606106) The Chinese know how to drink tea.
('67', 355, 1, 14, 606141) Theyput their leaves in a strainer and pour boiling water over the leaves which are never put in the tea pot.
('67', 355, 1, 15, 606251) The water has to attain only the colour of the straw.
('67', 355, 1, 16, 606305) It is pale yellow, never bordering on the red as tea made generally in India.
('67', 355, 1, 17, 606383) Strong tea is poison.

('67', 355, 4, 20, 606468) 1 5. There is no difference whatsoever between the two villages, so far as the village industries programme is concerned.
('67', 355, 4, 21, 606590) In no case should a worker come in conflict with the authorities.
('67', 355, 5, 22, 606656) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai who had explained: Some young men who have settled in a village in a Kathiawar State have sent the following questions to Gandhiji: (1) Which of the two should be preferred for swaraj worka village in a native State or a British Indian village.
('67', 355, 5, 23, 606957) (2) Which should be prefered from the point of view of the village industries programme?
('67', 355, 5, 24, 607046) (3) Is not the need for uplift work greater in the British Indian village?
('67', 355, 5, 25, 607121) (4) If the answer to 3 is in the affirmative, why should not all workers go to the British Indian villages?
('67', 355, 5, 26, 607229) (5) Would not the Congress give any definite direction in the matter?
('67', 355, 5, 27, 607299) (6) What standard of living should be adopted by the village worker?
('67', 355, 5, 28, 607368) The villagers standard is far too low to be acceptable to the workers.
('67', 355, 5, 29, 607439) You do not taboo milk and fruit for village workers.
('67', 355, 5, 30, 607492) But villagers never get these things.
('67', 355, 5, 31, 607530) How can a village worker conscientiously take them?
('67', 355, 5, 32, 607582) (7) It is a fact that millions are starving.
('67', 355, 5, 33, 607627) If we too follow suit, how are we to do work for them?
('67', 355, 5, 34, 607682) And yet in a family a brother would share his loaf with a brother rather than let him starve.
('67', 355, 5, 35, 607776) (8) What are the minimum necessaries of life?
('67', 356, 0, 1, 607822) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 357
('67', 356, 1, 2, 607870) 6 8. The main thing to be borne in mind by the village worker is that he is in the village for the villagers service, and it is his right and his duty to allow himself such articles of diet and other necessaries as would keep him fit and enable him to fulfil his function.
('67', 356, 1, 3, 608143) This will necessarily involve the acceptance of a higher standard of living by the village worker, but I have an impression that the villagers do not grudge the worker these necessary things.
('67', 356, 1, 4, 608335) The workers conscience is the test.
('67', 356, 1, 5, 608371) He must be self restrained, he will eat nothing in order to indulge his palate, he will go in for no luxuries, and will fill all his waking hours with work of service.
('67', 356, 1, 6, 608539) In spite of this, it is likely that a handful of people will cavil at his mode of life.
('67', 356, 1, 7, 608627) We have to live that criticism down.
('67', 356, 1, 8, 608664) The diet I have suggested is not quite unobtainable in a village, with a certain amount of labour.
('67', 356, 1, 9, 608763) Milk can generally be obtained, and there are numerous fruits, e.g., ber, karamda, mhora flower, which are easily available, but which we count of no value because they are so easily available.
('67', 356, 1, 10, 608957) There are all kinds of leaves available which grow wild in ourvillages, which we do not use because of sheer ignorance or laziness (if not snobbery).
('67', 356, 1, 11, 609107) I am myself using numerous varieties of these green leaves which I had never tried before, but which I find I should have used.
('67', 356, 1, 12, 609235) It is quite possible to make a cow in a village pay for her upkeep and maintenance.
('67', 356, 1, 13, 609319) I have not tried the experiment but I think it should be possible.
('67', 356, 1, 14, 609386) I have also an impression that it is not impossible for the villagers to obtain and live on the same articles of diet as the village workers and thus to adopt the same standard of life.

('67', 356, 3, 16, 609591) 557. SELF SUFFICING KHADI
('67', 356, 4, 17, 609617) From Madhopur centre in Bihar comes the news that in ten villages nineteen persons have had their yarn woven into khadi measuring 166 1 2 yards for personal use and that 82 persons in 22 villages had their yarn exchanged for khadi measuring 709 yards.
('67', 356, 4, 18, 609869) This is good news.
('67', 356, 4, 19, 609888) Good news of distribution of seeds and sowing them for growing cotton for self spinning comes from Payyanur and Nileshwar in Malabar.
('67', 356, 4, 20, 610022) When cotton growing for self spinning becomes universal
('67', 357, 0, 1, 610078) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 358
('67', 357, 1, 2, 610120) in the country, people can have their khadi for the mere labour spent upon it during leisure hours if the home growers of cotton will learn all the processes as they do in Assam for silk in many homes.
('67', 357, 1, 3, 610322) Silk connot be universalized.
('67', 357, 1, 4, 610352) Cotton can and almost was at one time.
('67', 357, 1, 5, 610391) This method means a most substantial addition to the national income and a perfect scheme of employment for the millions of the partially unemployed in this country.
('67', 357, 1, 6, 610557) Though the proposition is thus simple to state, it is undoubtedly very difficult to work.
('67', 357, 1, 7, 610647) But it is in no way impossible.
('67', 357, 1, 8, 610679) It needs no great outlay of capital.
('67', 357, 1, 9, 610716) The processes to be learnt are simple, the tools required are all ready in the villages or can be quickly made.
('67', 357, 1, 10, 610828) The greatest stumbling block is the disinclination of the people to work at new things and to exert intelligence.
('67', 357, 1, 11, 610942) Generations of enforced idleness and consequent starvation have led to loss of hope, stamina and even the will to live.
('67', 357, 1, 12, 611062) No greater calamity can befall a people than that they should lose hope even to the extent of the will to live.
('67', 357, 1, 13, 611174) But those who have not lost hope have to work with greater zeal than ever before with an unquenchable faith in their mission.
('67', 357, 1, 14, 611300) Their faith will certainly overcomemountains.
('67', 357, 1, 15, 611346) In this glorious country, where sufficient food and clothing can be produced without much labour and skill, there need never be any loss of hope.
('67', 357, 1, 16, 611492) But hope has to be translated into progressive action based on ever increasing knowledge of the science of khadi.
('67', 357, 1, 17, 611606) Workers have to respond to the lead that the Centre may give from time to time, and they have also to anticipate the objections of the villagers whom they have to serve.
('67', 357, 1, 18, 611776) For that purpose they have to come into closest touch and trust.
('67', 357, 1, 19, 611841) They may never appear before the villagers as patrons but they should appear as voluntary servants who have hitherto neglected their trust.
('67', 357, 1, 20, 611981) Given a due fulfilment of this primary indispensable condition, the rest will follow as night follows day.

('67', 357, 4, 23, 612141) August 24, 1935
('67', 357, 5, 24, 612157) RAOJIBHAI,
('67', 357, 6, 25, 612168) Can you not be content to have Dahibehn treated by Haribhai?
('67', 357, 6, 26, 612229) Try and see if you can persuade Chanchal.
('67', 357, 6, 27, 612271) One is put in an extremely difficult position when faced with two equal duties.
('67', 357, 6, 28, 612351) You, who know
('67', 358, 0, 1, 612365) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 359
('67', 358, 1, 2, 612413) the situation there better than I, may certainly guide her as you think best.
('67', 358, 1, 3, 612491) If you can get pure cows milk of good quality there, by all means organize a business in it.
('67', 358, 1, 4, 612584) But take up the work only after ascertaining what the producers get.
('67', 358, 1, 5, 612653) We shall have to enter their lives, know in minute detail how they live and work and what debts they owe.
('67', 358, 1, 6, 612759) You should thus know the history of the sample which you have sent to me.
('67', 358, 1, 7, 612833) All your depots should have the history of every sample, in this fashion: This sample was made by Bharwad Meghraj of Limbasi, who spenthours in the work;of milk cost; labour charges per hour; the middlemans commission; And this information should be passed on to the buyer.
('67', 358, 1, 8, 613107) Please dont tell me that this will take up too much of your time.
('67', 358, 1, 9, 613173) The work will not take so much time after it has been systematized.
('67', 358, 1, 10, 613241) No matter what rate is fixed by the Sangh, you should not pay less than two pice per hour.
('67', 358, 1, 11, 613332) In the case of articles for which average production per hour can be calculated, you should fix the rate for workper hour.
('67', 358, 1, 12, 613455) This can be done.
('67', 358, 1, 13, 613473) For instance, if an average spinner spins 400 [yards] 1 of yarn of 15 count in one hour, we may pay two pice for 400 [yards] 2 of 15 count.
('67', 358, 1, 14, 613613) Many new ideas are being discussed in Harijan these days.
('67', 358, 1, 15, 613671) I should like you to read all these articles regularly.
('67', 358, 1, 16, 613727) The institution of insolvency was originally intended to help persons like Chanchals father.
('67', 358, 1, 17, 613820) But afterwards it came to be misused by knaves and, therefore, fell into disrepute.
('67', 358, 1, 18, 613904) I, however, would certainly advise him to resort to this means and free himself from his worries.
('67', 358, 1, 19, 614002) He may then cherish the hope of being able to pay off the balance of his debts one day.
('67', 358, 1, 20, 614090) As things are, he would not even be able to engage himself in any business in peace because of harassment by importunate creditors.

('67', 362, 2, 4, 618457) 1 I did say something to this effect to someone and I recollect Mahadev saying on the same day that mistakes do occur in the Harijanbandhu and the Harijan Sevak and that it would be better to send the translations from here.
('67', 362, 2, 5, 618682) Mahadev even started some Gujarati translation.
('67', 362, 2, 6, 618730) No one person can be blamed for the occurence of errors.
('67', 362, 2, 7, 618787) Translation is a pretty difficult job and to be first rate it requires of the translator an equal command over both the languages.
('67', 362, 2, 8, 618918) I have to confess with regret that I am unable to read any one of the three journals.
('67', 362, 2, 9, 619004) I am in continuous touch with the material published in the Harijan as it passes through my hands but I am ignorant of all that is published in the other two journals.
('67', 362, 2, 10, 619172) Mahadev does go through some items but ours is a pitiable plight.
('67', 362, 2, 11, 619238) The burden of work is so overwhelming that we reconcile ourselves with what little we can do, regarding even that as Gods mercy.

('67', 364, 2, 6, 621924) I see much sickness around.
('67', 364, 2, 7, 621952) I strongly feel that nature cure, simple food, pure air, is all that a man needs.

('67', 364, 4, 14, 622321) 570. PRIZE ESSAY ON BARTER SYSTEM
('67', 364, 5, 15, 622355) WARDHA, August 26, 1935 Shri Uppulur Venkatakrishnayya is the trustee of the Khaddar Samsthanam which was started in the year 1927 at Gunadala near Bezwada.
('67', 364, 5, 16, 622512) He is an ardent believer in the system of barter, and has been practising it to some extent in his institution in its internal and external dealings, especially with reference to the production and distribution of food and clothing.
('67', 364, 5, 17, 622745) He believes it to be the only remedy for the present economic depression and thinks that it can solve the many evils arising from the present monetary system.
('67', 364, 5, 18, 622904) He further believes that the adoption of barter is essential to the development of agriculture, revival of khadi and other handicrafts and cottage industries in India, and the propagation and practice of the doctrine of non violence.
('67', 364, 5, 19, 623138) He holds that it is implied in non violence itself.
('67', 364, 5, 20, 623190) He fervently desires to know how far his views can stand the test of a scientific study and examination of the system.
('67', 364, 5, 21, 623309) He therefore offers a prize for the best essay on the subject, and he has chosen me as his instrument for

('67', 365, 0, 1, 623432) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 366
('67', 365, 1, 2, 623474) announcing his intention.
('67', 365, 1, 3, 623500) I have gladly consented to be the medium for inviting essays on the system of barter.
('67', 365, 1, 4, 623586) The prize winner will be given at his choice Rs. 500 in cash or Rs. 500 worth of geniune, durable khadi woven in the Samsthanam itself.
('67', 365, 1, 5, 623722) The cash amount is deposited with me.
('67', 365, 1, 6, 623760) The essay (which should be in English) should trace the early history of the barter system, the causes of its decline, and the possibilities of its revival at present.
('67', 365, 1, 7, 623928) It should also describe the purpose it served in the past and the part it can play in the future economic life of the world, with particular reference to its adaptability to the Indian village life concerning some or all of the departments of its activities.
('67', 365, 1, 8, 624187) The essay should discuss the conditions congenial for its successful working and development and to what extent the assistance of the ruling power is required for the same, and should indicate the nature and mode of exchange if the adoption of the system is recommended.
('67', 365, 1, 9, 624458) The essay should also discuss the effects of the barter system on the development of the internal and international trade of India.
('67', 365, 1, 10, 624590) K. T. Shah, Shri Vaikunth L. Mehta and Prof.

('67', 365, 1, 14, 624823) Kumarappa not later than the noon of August 31, 1936. No prize will be awarded if no essay reached the standard to be determined by the examiners.
('67', 365, 1, 15, 624970) The result of the examination will be announced not later than 31st December 1936. The copyright of the prize essay will vest in the Khaddar Samsthanam.
('67', 365, 1, 16, 625123) I do hope that there will be keen competition for winning the prize not for its monetary value but for the importance of the subject.

('67', 367, 8, 11, 626951) I have sent a wire today.
('67', 367, 8, 12, 626977) I was expecting a telegram from you but none has come.
('67', 367, 8, 13, 627032) What can you do?
('67', 367, 8, 14, 627049) And who would think of sending a telegram from there?
('67', 367, 8, 15, 627103) It is good that I have a detailed letter from Ba.
('67', 367, 8, 16, 627153) She writes and says that you have become panicky.
('67', 367, 8, 17, 627203) But why should you be alarmed because of the illness?
('67', 367, 8, 18, 627257) When we know the ultimate result and are prepared for it, why should you feel frightened?
('67', 367, 8, 19, 627347) But there is still plenty of time before you take leave.

('67', 368, 1, 4, 628089) I have no doubt given that concession in the hope that that would lead to increased sale of khadi.
('67', 368, 1, 5, 628188) I do not remember the Charkha Sangh having made any rule for it.

('67', 370, 5, 20, 632026) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('67', 370, 6, 21, 632044) I learnt from Manis letter yesterday about Babas 1 tonsils.
('67', 370, 6, 22, 632104) Isnt it strange that a boy of his age should have such enlarged tonsils?
('67', 370, 6, 23, 632177) What could be the cause?
('67', 370, 6, 24, 632202) Can the doctors explain it?
('67', 370, 7, 25, 632230) What way have you found out of the difficulty created by the illness of Durbar 3 and Bhaskar?
('67', 370, 7, 26, 632324) Do you need Mahadev?
('67', 370, 7, 27, 632345) Morarji and Chandulal will stay here for two or three days yet.
('67', 370, 7, 28, 632409) Swami Yoganand of the U.S.A. is here.

('67', 374, 10, 18, 637686) He says that he will not leave without meeting you.

('67', 376, 1, 2, 639470) 591. LETTER TO A VILLAGE WORKER 1
('67', 376, 2, 3, 639504) [Before August 31, 1935] If you can get good and clean cows ghee made there, you can certainly concentrate on the industry.
('67', 376, 2, 4, 639628) You must first ascertain whether it secures the ghee maker anything like a living wage.
('67', 376, 2, 5, 639716) We have to enter into the lives of our working classes, ascertain, what they eat and drink, where they live, and how they live, to what extent they are indebted, and so on and so forth.
('67', 376, 2, 6, 639902) You should thus be able to tell me the whole history of the sample of ghee you have sent me.
('67', 376, 2, 7, 639995) You must maintain in your shop a register containing all these details: (1) the name and place of the producer; (2) time taken for preparation; (3) quantity of milk from which ghee was prepared; (4) price of ghee; (5) wage earned by the producer per hour; (6) the middle mans share and transit charges.
('67', 376, 2, 8, 640298) Every article that you stock and sell out of your depot must bear this history ticket and whoever purchases it has a right to ask for it.
('67', 376, 2, 9, 640436) You will not tell me that this is a tedious procedure and that you have not time for it.
('67', 376, 2, 10, 640525) When once the thing has got started, it will be a matter of routine and not much time will be required.
('67', 376, 2, 11, 640629) Whatever minimum wage may be fixed by the A.I.V.I.A., you will in no case pay less than half an anna per hour.
('67', 376, 2, 12, 640740) This is easily done.
('67', 376, 2, 13, 640761) Find out the number of hours taken up in the manufacture of an article, and then fix the wage and the price.
('67', 376, 2, 14, 640870) Thus, for instance, it takes an ordinary spinner one hour to spin 400 yards of yarn of 15 counts.
('67', 376, 2, 15, 640968) You will therefore pay half an anna as the wage for spinning 400 yards of 15 counts of strong, even yarn.

('67', 376, 4, 17, 641093) 592. AN IMPORTANT RESOLUTION
('67', 376, 5, 18, 641122) After a full two days discussion the following resolution was unanimously passed by the A.I.V.I.A. Board at its periodical meeting last week:
('67', 376, 6, 19, 641264) 1 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('67', 376, 6, 20, 641319) The addressee had asked if he could concentrate on ghee making as a supplementary industry to agriculture and, if so, how he should do it.
('67', 376, 6, 21, 641458) Harijan, 19 10 1935, published an account of the addressees experience about procuring good ghee.
('67', 377, 0, 1, 641556) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 378
('67', 377, 1, 2, 641598) Whereas the object of the Association includes bringing about the moral and material advancement of the rural population by encouraging the revival of dead and dying industries, the Board of Management desire that, for all commodities produced or marketed under the aegis of the Association, each workman should receive a minimum wage calculated on the basis of eight hours efficient work sufficient at least for his (or her) maintenance in accordance with a scientifically prescribed scale of minimum food requirements; and it should be the duty of all connected with the Association to see that the workmen engaged in the industries promoted by them actually receive remuneration never less than the scale herein prescribed, always bearing in mind that as and when circumstances permit there should be a progressive rise in the scale so as to reach a standard enabling a workers family to be properly maintained out of the earnings of its working members.
('67', 377, 1, 3, 642556) If this resolution is honestly worked it must produce far reaching consequences.
('67', 377, 1, 4, 642637) It would render a measure of tardy justice to the working class, whether labourers or artisans.
('67', 377, 1, 5, 642733) To arrive at the correct figure in terms of money is going to prove a difficult task.
('67', 377, 1, 6, 642819) The members and agents will have to compile three kinds of tables: 1. How much do the workmen and work women earn per hour at their work in the different spheres in the different provinces?
('67', 377, 1, 7, 643009) 2. What is the daily diet of the workmen within their area of work and what is its cost?
('67', 377, 1, 8, 643098) 3. A scientific scale on a minimum basis prepared by experts in the respective provinces out of the local staples with the cost thereof.
('67', 377, 1, 9, 643235) What statistics I have received go to show that all over India, except in the Punjab, the articles of diet the masses live on are deficient in nutritive value.
('67', 377, 1, 10, 643395) The most helpful pamphlet on the minimum diet scale is the one prepared by Dr. H. V. Tilak, on behalf of the Bombay Presidency Baby and Health Week Association (Delisle Road, Bombay 11).
('67', 377, 1, 11, 643582) It is called Balanced Diets.
('67', 377, 1, 12, 643611) Its price is four annas.
('67', 377, 1, 13, 643636) It has been translated into Marathi and Gujarati.
('67', 377, 1, 14, 643686) The diet recommended by the pamphlet, containing a variety of whole grain (some of which is sprouted) including soya beans, dried skim milk and vegetables, increases a white rat to 55 grammes in weight from 13 grammes when fed on a diet containing an excess of highly polished rice with very little vegetables and milk.
('67', 377, 1, 15, 644006) The diet scale recommended in the pamphlet has been prepared after careful experimentation.
('67', 377, 1, 16, 644098) It costs in Bombay Rs. 5 per month.
('67', 377, 1, 17, 644134) I have my doubts about the possibility of introducing soya

('67', 378, 1, 2, 644241) beans and dried skim milk in the poor mans diet even in a place like Bombay.
('67', 378, 1, 3, 644318) The sprouting of pulses and malting of jowari recommended by Dr. Tilak is also very difficult of enforcement in private households.
('67', 378, 1, 4, 644450) It is almost impossible of introduction in villages.
('67', 378, 1, 5, 644503) Skim milk is unobtainable in the villages, and I know that in hundreds of them not a drop of fresh milk or good ghee is to be had.
('67', 378, 1, 6, 644634) I mention these difficulties in order that taking Dr. Tilaks carefully prepared scale as a basis, experts may work out a scale more suited to the villages in their provinces and yet produce the results that Dr. Tilaks diet is claimed to have achieved.
('67', 378, 1, 7, 644886) We may not be satisfied until the village workers have put the workmen coming under their influence in possession of means to procure an adequate diet for themselves and their dependants.
('67', 378, 1, 8, 645074) Reduction in price of articles must be a consideration that must always be subordinated to the ability of workmen engaged in their production to earn a living wage for themselves.
('67', 378, 1, 9, 645254) We must rule out the question of competition with machine made articles whether foreign or indigenous.
('67', 378, 1, 10, 645357) Millions of workmen must not live on the margin of starvation so that the few engaged in production by powerdriven machinery may have more than they need.
('67', 378, 1, 11, 645512) In the absence of State protection public opinion should be so cultivated that it will refuse to exploit the toilers of the land.
('67', 378, 1, 12, 645642) Let khadi workers who are engaged in producing khadi for sale note that what applies to the other village industries applies equally to khadi produced for sale.
('67', 378, 1, 13, 645803) From the spinner to the weaver all the khadi working men should have the wage contemplated in the resolution under discussion.
('67', 378, 1, 14, 645930) Harijan, 31 8 1935
('67', 378, 2, 15, 645949) 593. OUR DUTY
('67', 378, 3, 16, 645963) Perhaps the burden of untouchability falls on Harijans in one way nowhere so heavily as in Gujarat.
('67', 378, 3, 17, 646063) In Dholka a Harijan was done to death by a savarna Hindu and the murderer escaped with a fine of Rs. 300. In Kavitha the so called Rajputs mercilessly attacked helpless Harijans for daring to send their children to a public school.
('67', 378, 3, 18, 646295) In Kathiawar just now in various villages in its various provinces savarnas persecute Harijans because a plague has broken out among the cattle.
('67', 378, 3, 19, 646440) They do so under the superstitious belief that the disease is caused owing to the incantations or some other machinations of Harijans.
('67', 379, 0, 1, 646575) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 380
('67', 379, 1, 2, 646617) Harijan is in perpetual fear of injury to his person or property.
('67', 379, 1, 3, 646683) The reformer feels helpless; the State is indifferent or is itself also helpless in the face of the powerful savarnas.
('67', 379, 1, 4, 646802) The reason is obvious.
('67', 379, 1, 5, 646825) The Harijan does not know how to secure redress.
('67', 379, 1, 6, 646874) He has no will to defend himself.
('67', 379, 1, 7, 646908) He is wholly unconscious of his human dignity or innate ability to protect himself against the insolence of fellow human beings.
('67', 379, 1, 8, 647037) The reformer has to carry the torch of knowledge among the persecutors, for they know not what they are doing.
('67', 379, 1, 9, 647148) Leaflets may be distributed among them.
('67', 379, 1, 10, 647188) But the savarna lynchers rarely read newspapers or leaflets.
('67', 379, 1, 11, 647249) They are self contained and self satisfied.
('67', 379, 1, 12, 647293) Personal contact is the only way of approach to them.
('67', 379, 1, 13, 647347) They must be visited if need be in their own homes.
('67', 379, 1, 14, 647399) Meetings should be addressed in their villages.
('67', 379, 1, 15, 647447) No amount of anger or declamation will cure them of their ignorance.
('67', 379, 1, 16, 647516) The quickest way to combat ignorance is the spread of the knowledge that would tell them how cattle diseases are contracted and how by careful treatment they may be prevented or cured.
('67', 379, 1, 17, 647701) All this means patient labour on the part of those who will carry on the propaganda.
('67', 379, 1, 18, 647786) The States concerned should also be moved to protectthe poor Harijans who are molested.
('67', 379, 1, 19, 647874) Where the reformers are fairly numerous they may have to settle in the midst of Harijans and themselves share their hardships, if their presence does not prevent molestation.
('67', 379, 1, 20, 648049) In this campaign against ignorance the sanatanists assistance should also be invoked.
('67', 379, 1, 21, 648135) I am sure no sane sanatanist will defend the cruel persecution of the utterly innocent Harijans by ignorant, misguided savarnas.

('67', 379, 4, 24, 648309) September 1, 1935
('67', 379, 5, 25, 648327) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('67', 379, 6, 26, 648342) This paper is the waste of what is now being prepared here by apprentices.
('67', 379, 6, 27, 648417) I am sending it for you to see the colour and the thinness.
('67', 379, 6, 28, 648477) It lacks finish.
('67', 379, 6, 29, 648494) Presently we shall produce the finest paper made in India at a reasonable cost.
('67', 379, 6, 30, 648574) Devdass coming to you will be earlier than I had expected.
('67', 379, 6, 31, 648633) I am sending your love letter to Devdas.
('67', 379, 6, 32, 648674) Kumarappa may leave Nagpur on 4th and be with you on 6th.
('67', 380, 0, 1, 648732) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 381
('67', 380, 1, 2, 648780) I have sent you a bag of rice with Avinashilingam.
('67', 380, 1, 3, 648831) It is very good though cheap.
('67', 380, 1, 4, 648861) I have paid double railway fare, for, the goods train would have meant a months waiting and the risk of damage.
('67', 380, 1, 5, 648973) I wonder if I did right.
('67', 380, 1, 6, 648998) The rice should keep good in Simla though unpolished rice must not be stored for long.
('67', 380, 1, 7, 649085) If the quantity sent is too much for you, you should sell it.
('67', 380, 1, 8, 649147) I hope to send you the bill herewith if it has not gone already.
('67', 380, 1, 9, 649212) The takli also went with Avinashilingam.
('67', 380, 1, 10, 649253) If Devdas does come, you should use him for khaddar propaganda.
('67', 380, 1, 11, 649317) He knows spinning.
('67', 380, 1, 12, 649336) We are crowded here just now.
('67', 380, 1, 13, 649366) We have the members of the Harijan Board.
('67', 380, 1, 14, 649408) Janakiprasad finished his seventeen days under extraordinarily good condition.
('67', 380, 1, 15, 649487) He broke it on honey, lemon and water.
('67', 380, 1, 16, 649526) I was not able to take your apples.
('67', 380, 1, 17, 649562) I have so many who are in greater need.
('67', 380, 1, 18, 649602) Love to you both.

('67', 380, 5, 22, 649720) September 2, 1935 CHI.
('67', 380, 5, 23, 649743) CHHAGANLAL, You must have read the explanation 1 about how to make bone manure.
('67', 380, 5, 24, 649823) About the other processes, I have got an article specially written.
('67', 380, 5, 25, 649891) Read it carefully and try the methods or induce somebody else to do so.
('67', 380, 5, 26, 649963) They are such as can be tried without any help.
('67', 380, 5, 27, 650011) You can even send somebody here and get him trained.
('67', 380, 5, 28, 650064) Lakshmidas intends to send someone.
('67', 380, 5, 29, 650100) I have preserved the report of the Sangh in the hope of being able to read it some time, but I do not know when I shall be.
('67', 380, 5, 30, 650224) I alone know under what pressure I am working.
('67', 380, 5, 31, 650271) It is true that I have given up fruit.
('67', 380, 5, 32, 650310) They cost too much.
('67', 380, 5, 33, 650330) I do eat those which are cheap, but no fruit is cheap just now.
('67', 380, 5, 34, 650394) Orange peel is certainly cheap and whenever there is any I get it made into jam.
('67', 380, 5, 35, 650475) I then need less of jaggery and the purpose of eating fruit is also partly

('67', 381, 0, 1, 650595) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 382
('67', 381, 1, 2, 650637) served.
('67', 381, 1, 3, 650645) I am experimenting just now with such jam.
('67', 381, 1, 4, 650688) But generally I depend only on milk and green vegetables, besides honey of course.
('67', 381, 1, 5, 650771) There has been no ill effect.
('67', 381, 1, 6, 650801) It remains to be seen how long I can go on with this diet.
('67', 381, 1, 7, 650860) We cannot judge in a short time.
('67', 381, 1, 8, 650893) I eat green leaves, as also pumpkin, gourd, etc., which grow in the garden here.
('67', 381, 1, 9, 650974) Just now we get ladys fingers and pumpkin, besides bhaji.
('67', 381, 1, 10, 651032) Bhansali is behaving with great self restraint.
('67', 381, 1, 11, 651080) He submits to my control and takes care of his health.
('67', 381, 1, 12, 651135) He keeps very cheerful.
('67', 381, 1, 13, 651159) If I restrain him too much, I am afraid, I would lose him.
('67', 381, 1, 14, 651218) So I restrain him only as much as he will bear.
('67', 381, 1, 15, 651266) His path is entirely different from ours.
('67', 381, 1, 16, 651308) How can we, therefore, compare his way of life with mine or anybody elses?
('67', 381, 1, 17, 651383) Who knows who is right?
('67', 381, 1, 18, 651407) May it not be that both of us are right?
('67', 381, 1, 19, 651448) How can one blind person judge another blind person?
('67', 381, 1, 20, 651501) Both will deserve compliments if they escape falling into a ditch.
('67', 381, 1, 21, 651568) I have given your message to Bhansali.
('67', 381, 1, 22, 651607) Whenever he laughs, he fills the whole room with his laughter.
('67', 381, 1, 23, 651670) We dont have the privacy of the Ashram here.
('67', 381, 1, 24, 651715) He occupies one corner in a big room, which is shared with him by Kanti, Navin and three or four others.
('67', 381, 1, 25, 651820) No extra space is left.
('67', 381, 1, 26, 651844) The picture of the conditions here is quite interesting.
('67', 381, 1, 27, 651901) With me are Mahadev, Kanu, and Mirabehn as permanent fixtures.
('67', 381, 1, 28, 651964) Others come and go.
('67', 381, 1, 29, 651984) Another room is occupied at present by Nimu and her three children, and three more women.
('67', 381, 1, 30, 652074) Amtussalaam spends the day in the kitchen or in my room.
('67', 381, 1, 31, 652131) And so also does Prabhavati when she is here.
('67', 381, 1, 32, 652177) When it is raining, all of us sleep in the verandah or in the room; at other times, we sleep in the open on the terrace above.
('67', 381, 1, 33, 652304) This will give you some idea of the conditions here.
('67', 381, 1, 34, 652357) The expense on food comes on an average to between seven and seven and a half [annas].
('67', 381, 1, 35, 652444) We wish to reduce it.
('67', 381, 1, 36, 652466) Let us see if we succeed.
('67', 381, 1, 37, 652492) We hope to reduce it to five!
('67', 381, 1, 38, 652522) At present I wouldnt feel unhappy at all in accepting the services of a teacher in a Government school who otherwise did not violate our ideals.
('67', 381, 1, 39, 652667) I made all possible inquiries regarding this friends character and his love of khadi.
('67', 381, 1, 40, 652753) He wrote to me a letter which I found satisfactory.
('67', 381, 1, 41, 652805) He believes in khadi and wears it for the most part.
('67', 381, 1, 42, 652858) He has not been able to go as far as to wear dhotis of khadi.
('67', 381, 1, 43, 652920) He had even a tussle with his superior for wearing a khadi cap and other garments of khadi, and he won.
('67', 381, 1, 44, 653024) His relation with a lady which was the subject of an allegation against him still continues, but he says that it has always been pure.
('67', 381, 1, 45, 653159) His letter seemed to me quite truthful.
('67', 381, 1, 46, 653199) This inquiry was

('67', 382, 1, 4, 653386) I have exchanged letters with Narahari and Vallabhbhai on this subject.
('67', 382, 1, 5, 653458) Sardar has nothing to say about it.
('67', 382, 1, 6, 653494) Narahari seems to be satisfied with Narandass statement.
('67', 382, 1, 7, 653551) It has also been sent to Vajubhai and Jethalal and they have been requested to send their replies.
('67', 382, 1, 8, 653650) I found nothing to criticize in that statement.
('67', 382, 1, 9, 653698) There seem to be some differences of principle between Vajubhai and Narandas, but they also are not clear to me, except that the latter may have laid greater stress on crafts and expected the teachers to pay attention to them.
('67', 382, 1, 10, 653925) I wouldnt regard that as a difference of principle.
('67', 382, 1, 11, 653977) Have you read Vajubhais and Jethalals letters?
('67', 382, 1, 12, 654024) If you are prepared to take interest in the matter and give your time to it, I will send their explanations to you.

('67', 382, 8, 22, 654487) Have you fallen ill again?
('67', 382, 8, 23, 654514) If one lives very carefully, why should one ever fall ill?
('67', 382, 8, 24, 654573) Wont you now be coming here in a very few days?
('67', 382, 8, 25, 654621) Kunvarji has written asking for your being sent to Rajkot.
('67', 382, 8, 26, 654680) He has already sent for Rami.

('67', 383, 4, 5, 654933) Rest assured that all will be well with you.
('67', 383, 4, 6, 654978) I know that you are being tested there.
('67', 383, 4, 7, 655018) But you have patience and faith and, therefore, everything will be well.
('67', 383, 4, 8, 655091) There must be somebody there, too, to look after things.
('67', 383, 4, 9, 655148) Besides, you have to think of your parents.
('67', 383, 4, 10, 655192) Circumstances have thus favoured you at present with an opportunity for doing service there.
('67', 383, 4, 11, 655285) God has, as it were, so ordained things that you are able to perform all your duties.
('67', 383, 4, 12, 655371) Yes, it was feared that Devdas might get paralysis.
('67', 383, 4, 13, 655423) He is better now.
('67', 383, 4, 14, 655441) He has become weak.
('67', 383, 4, 15, 655461) He and Ba will perhaps go to Simla.
('67', 383, 4, 16, 655497) It rarely occurs to me to write about such matters.
('67', 383, 4, 17, 655549) I understand about Mathew.

('67', 384, 8, 10, 656368) You can imagine the relief I had on receiving your wire.
('67', 384, 8, 11, 656425) As usual Mahadev is taking this with him.
('67', 384, 8, 12, 656467) I wish I had come myself but I must not.
('67', 384, 8, 13, 656508) You will frankly give me your opinion on all the things of common interest.
('67', 384, 8, 14, 656584) Unless there is an insuperable bar you should take charge of the Congress ship next year.
('67', 384, 8, 15, 656674) You will wire to me Kamalas condition on reaching there.
('67', 384, 8, 16, 656731) The news of your release must itself have brought her considerable relief.
('67', 384, 8, 17, 656806) I hope you were keeping well.

('67', 384, 11, 20, 656934) September 4, 1935
('67', 384, 12, 21, 656952) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('67', 384, 13, 22, 656967) This is the thinnest paper made here.
('67', 384, 13, 23, 657005) You can write on both the sides as you can see.
('67', 384, 13, 24, 657053) He has prepared the blotting paper too.
('67', 384, 13, 25, 657093) And he promises to make considerable improvements.
('67', 384, 13, 26, 657144) This paper industry may prove a veritable boon.
('67', 384, 13, 27, 657192) If it does, it will be a proof of what a combination of talent and labour can do for the village.
('67', 384, 13, 28, 657290) I am hoping to get with your assistance, more than even eight annas per day for the makers.
('67', 384, 14, 29, 657382) 1 The addressees reply telegram of even date read : Leaving this evening by air.

('67', 385, 1, 2, 657552) Avinashilingam has got your rice with him, he says, as he could not find your place.
('67', 385, 1, 3, 657637) He would not let me pay the railage.
('67', 385, 1, 4, 657674) The cost of the bag is a trifle as you will see.
('67', 385, 1, 5, 657723) The railage twice the price of the article!
('67', 385, 1, 6, 657767) I wonder if I did right in sending you all that quantity.
('67', 385, 1, 7, 657825) Perhaps you did not know what a bag would contain.
('67', 385, 1, 8, 657876) There are bags and bags!
('67', 385, 1, 9, 657901) Having asked you to accommodate Kumarappa and Devdas I am not going to say more than I have done.
('67', 385, 1, 10, 657999) I only hope that they will not prove a source of burden to you.
('67', 385, 1, 11, 658063) Of course you are not expected to give any time to them.
('67', 385, 1, 12, 658120) It is monstrous for poor people to think of going to fashionable hill stations.
('67', 385, 1, 13, 658200) You are responsible for the mischief.
('67', 385, 1, 14, 658238) My poverty is only so called?
('67', 385, 1, 15, 658268) Shummy must not forget the real poor.
('67', 385, 1, 16, 658306) I must have the analysis of the neem leaf.

('67', 385, 5, 21, 658467) KAMALNAYAN, I am glad that I got your letter, though late.
('67', 385, 5, 22, 658526) Repetition of Ramanama, if done regularly, will help you.
('67', 385, 5, 23, 658584) It does not matter if you do not use hand made paper there.
('67', 385, 5, 24, 658644) To do that, you should feel zeal and passionate sympathy for the poor.
('67', 385, 5, 25, 658715) When these become part of your nature, you will on your own start doing these things.
('67', 385, 5, 26, 658801) Only what you do spontaneously and gladly will have value and bear fruit.
('67', 385, 5, 27, 658875) Do not form any views from what you see there about the difference between the British and other foreigners.
('67', 385, 5, 28, 658984) Let me tell one thing regarding dress.
('67', 385, 5, 29, 659023) You may give up khadi there if you cannot willingly make it a rule to wear it.
('67', 385, 5, 30, 659102) Wear whatever dress is convenient to you and of whatever cloth you find suitable.
('67', 385, 5, 31, 659184) I believe, this answers all your questions.
('67', 385, 5, 32, 659228) Thus, you may wear on overcoat, made from foreign cloth or mill cloth, and likewise socks and banian for exercise.
('67', 385, 5, 33, 659343) It wont be bad if you try to get all these things hand made, but you will be committing no sin, either, if you dont.
('67', 385, 5, 34, 659460) Your main duty while you are there is to study hard, to acquire mastery in your subjects, to acquire the virtues of fearlessness,

('67', 386, 1, 3, 659760) Observe the life there.
('67', 386, 1, 4, 659784) Spend every moment usefully.
('67', 386, 1, 5, 659813) Keep a diary.
('67', 386, 1, 6, 659827) I am returning your letter.

('67', 386, 7, 13, 660042) BHAI VALLABHBHAI,
('67', 386, 8, 14, 660060) Mahadev left yesterday for Prayag to meet Jawaharlal.
('67', 386, 8, 15, 660114) But I see from the latters wire received today that Mahadev will not be able to meet him, since he is leaving 1 this evening.
('67', 386, 8, 16, 660240) The Bombay Government has made its reply as venomous as it could.
('67', 386, 8, 17, 660306) Its meaning is clear.
('67', 386, 8, 18, 660328) Every effort will be made to suppress the facts.
('67', 386, 8, 19, 660377) I now feel that we should not publish the correspondence for the present.
('67', 386, 8, 20, 660451) It may be published together with the report of the Committee, when it is received, as our introduction to the report explaining the genesis of the Committee.
('67', 386, 8, 21, 660610) Do you see anything against this?
('67', 386, 8, 22, 660644) It is desirable that the Committee should finish its work as soon as possible.
('67', 386, 8, 23, 660723) I hope Baba is all right now.
('67', 386, 8, 24, 660753) At present we have some meeting or other everyday .

('67', 387, 2, 4, 661241) What I have said is that all my activities have swaraj as their goal.
('67', 387, 2, 5, 661311) Every breath I take is dedicated to it.
('67', 387, 2, 6, 661351) To reach that goal sooner I left Yeravda Mandir and took up Harijan work and have now taken up village industries work.
('67', 387, 2, 7, 661471) Worship of any God is worship of Lord Krishna.
('67', 387, 2, 8, 661518) It is now our duty to help Kanti.

('67', 387, 5, 14, 661799) Mahadev has replied to your earlier letter.
('67', 387, 5, 15, 661843) Today Mahadev is on the train to Prayag.
('67', 387, 5, 16, 661884) Jawaharlal must have slipped away last evening.
('67', 387, 5, 17, 661932) Still, the trip could not be avoided.
('67', 387, 5, 18, 661970) A more exhaustive statement of accounts of the Tilak Swaraj Fund than the one you have sent has already been published in octavo size.
('67', 387, 5, 19, 662105) This is not it.
('67', 387, 5, 20, 662121) If this is all you have, then it is incomplete.
('67', 387, 5, 21, 662169) It would be proper to write that the printed version is available only at Revashankarbhais or at the All India office.
('67', 387, 5, 22, 662288) I have not gone deeply into it.
('67', 387, 5, 23, 662320) You will have gone through my correspondence with J. which is with Sardar.
('67', 387, 5, 24, 662395) It is not to be published.
('67', 387, 5, 25, 662422) I have nothing to say in my defence.
('67', 387, 5, 26, 662459) The [charges] against the Congress can be answered only by producing the accounts.
('67', 387, 5, 27, 662542) I am saving your letter for Mahadev.
('67', 387, 5, 28, 662579) Enquire at Revashankarbhais for other major items in the accounts.

('67', 388, 2, 3, 662904) WARDHA, September 6, 1935
('67', 388, 3, 4, 662930) MY DEAR AMRIT,
('67', 388, 4, 5, 662945) Your daily post has commenced even before the patients 1 are there!
('67', 388, 4, 6, 663013) This is like your rehearsal of Shakuntala.
('67', 388, 4, 7, 663056) Next time you come, you will teach something of your art to the girls, if a little time can be saved from your secretarial work.
('67', 388, 4, 8, 663185) I suppose your rehearsal there was in English?
('67', 388, 4, 9, 663232) Whose translation was it?
('67', 388, 4, 10, 663258) Who were the actresses?
('67', 388, 4, 11, 663282) Yes, you will have the salesman and the present rent paid for a limited period if you will guarantee purchase of definite minimum of khadi and not stock mill cloth.
('67', 388, 4, 12, 663447) You can sell all other swadeshi articles.
('67', 388, 4, 13, 663489) But my anxiety is for you not to add to your already heavy burdens, financial and administrative.
('67', 388, 4, 14, 663587) Run the swadeshi enterprise by all means if you have the right stamp of men and your financial responsibility is rigidly fixed.
('67', 388, 4, 15, 663715) The undertakings with which I am connected are so vast in their scope that they can absorb fortunes.
('67', 388, 4, 16, 663816) That they have never yet done so is because I have never allowed them to go out of hand.
('67', 388, 4, 17, 663905) And there is protection from within as there is little chance of personal gain.
('67', 388, 4, 18, 663985) All I want therefore is your great ability, constancy and purity dedicated to the service of the lowliest and the downtrodden.
('67', 388, 4, 19, 664112) That, thank God, I already have.
('67', 388, 4, 20, 664145) I return Vijaya Singhs letter.
('67', 388, 4, 21, 664176) I do not like it over much.
('67', 388, 4, 22, 664204) But I have no right to judge.
('67', 388, 4, 23, 664234) You will insist on a proper accounting of every pice spent.
('67', 388, 4, 24, 664294) Mahadev has gone for a day to meet Jawaharlal.
('67', 388, 4, 25, 664341) I fear however that he must have missed him by a few hours.
('67', 388, 4, 26, 664401) Jawaharlal flew earlier than he had expected.
('67', 388, 4, 27, 664447) I hope you are not overworking yourself.

('67', 389, 4, 7, 664834) Since you are going to Trivandrum, you may see the Government apiary which is said to be there.
('67', 389, 4, 8, 664930) You know Ramachandra there, do you not?
('67', 389, 4, 9, 664970) You should seek him out.
('67', 389, 4, 10, 664995) He is secretary of the Harijan Sevak Sangh and one of our finest workers.

('67', 391, 2, 3, 666979) [Before September 7, 1935] 2
('67', 391, 3, 4, 667008) GANDHIJI: Why is there evil in the world, is a difficult question to answer.
('67', 391, 3, 5, 667085) I can only give what I may call a villagers answer.
('67', 391, 3, 6, 667137) If there is good there must also be evil, just as where there is light there is also darkness, but it is true only so far as we human mortals are concerned.
('67', 391, 3, 7, 667294) Before God there is nothing good, nothing evil.
('67', 391, 3, 8, 667342) We poor villagers may talk of His dispensation in human terms, but our language is not Gods.
('67', 391, 3, 9, 667435) The Vedanta says the world is maya.
('67', 391, 3, 10, 667471) Even that explanation is a babbling of imperfect humanity.
('67', 391, 3, 11, 667530) I therefore say that I am not going to bother my head about it.
('67', 391, 3, 12, 667594) Even if I was allowed to peep into the innermost recess of Gods chamber I should not care to do it.
('67', 391, 3, 13, 667694) For I should not know what to do there.
('67', 391, 3, 14, 667734) It is enough for our spiritual growth to know that God is always with the doer of good.
('67', 391, 3, 15, 667822) That again is a villagers explanation.
('67', 391, 4, 16, 667861) YOGANANDA: But if He is All mighty, as unquestionably He is, why does He not free us from evil?
('67', 391, 4, 17, 667957) I would rule out this question, too.
('67', 391, 4, 18, 667994) God and we are not equals.
('67', 391, 4, 19, 668021) Equals may put such questions to one another, but not unequals.Villagers do not ask why town dwellers do things which if they did would mean certain destruction.
('67', 391, 5, 20, 668183) I quite see what you mean.
('67', 391, 5, 21, 668210) It is a strong point you have made.
('67', 391, 5, 22, 668246) But who made God?
('67', 391, 5, 23, 668264) If He is All powerful, He must have made Himself.
('67', 391, 6, 24, 668314) Do you think He is an autocrat or a democrat?
('67', 391, 6, 25, 668360) I do not think these things at all.
('67', 391, 6, 26, 668396) I do not want to divide the power with Him and hence I am absolved from having to consider these questions.
('67', 391, 6, 27, 668504) I am content with the doing of the task in front of me.
('67', 391, 6, 28, 668560) I do not worry about the why and wherefore of things.
('67', 391, 7, 29, 668614) But has He not given us reason?
('67', 391, 8, 30, 668646) 1 This is extracted from Weekly Letter by Mahadev Desai, who had reported that Swami Yogananda had just returned home after a long stay in America.
('67', 391, 8, 31, 668794) On his way to Ranchi, he halted at Wardha to meet Gandhiji.
('67', 391, 8, 32, 668854) 2 According to Gandhi1915 1948: A Detailed Chronology, the discussion took place on August 26 and 27.
('67', 392, 0, 1, 668956) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 393
('67', 392, 1, 2, 669004) Indeed He has.
('67', 392, 1, 3, 669019) But that reason helps us to see that we should not dabble in things we cannot fathom.
('67', 392, 1, 4, 669105) It is my implicit belief that a true villager has an amazing amount of common sense and therefore he never worries about these things.
('67', 392, 2, 5, 669240) Then I will now ask a different question.
('67', 392, 2, 6, 669282) Do you believe it is easier to be evil
('67', 392, 3, 7, 669321) than good, that a descent is easier than an ascent?
('67', 392, 3, 8, 669373) Apparently it is so.
('67', 392, 3, 9, 669394) But really it is easier to be good than to be evil.
('67', 392, 3, 10, 669446) Of course poets have said that descent to hell is easy, but I do not think so.
('67', 392, 3, 11, 669525) Nor do I think there are more bad people in the world than good.
('67', 392, 3, 12, 669590) In that case God himself would be evil and not an embodiment of ahimsa or love which He is.
('67', 392, 4, 13, 669682) May I know your definition of ahimsa?
('67', 392, 4, 14, 669720) Ahimsa means avoiding injury to anything on earth, in thought, word and deed .
('67', 392, 5, 15, 669799) I shall now change the subject.
('67', 392, 5, 16, 669831) You would prefer self control to birth control?
('67', 392, 5, 17, 669879) I think artificial birth control or birth control according to methods suggested today and recommended in the West is suicidal.
('67', 392, 5, 18, 670007) When I say suicidal, I do not mean resulting in the extinction of the race, I mean suicidal in a higher sense of the term, that is to say these methods make man lower than the brute; they are immoral.
('67', 392, 6, 19, 670208) But how long are we to tolerate indiscriminate procreation?
('67', 392, 6, 20, 670268) I know a man who
('67', 392, 7, 21, 670285) used to purchase a seer of milk, and went on diluting it with water in order to divide it
('67', 392, 8, 22, 670375) between his children whose number increased every year.
('67', 392, 8, 23, 670431) Dont you think this was a
('67', 392, 9, 24, 670457) It is a sin to bring forth unwanted children, but I think it is a greater sin to avoid the consequences of ones own action.
('67', 392, 9, 25, 670581) It simply unmans man.
('67', 392, 10, 26, 670603) What then is the most practical method of telling man this truth?
('67', 392, 10, 27, 670669) The most practical method is to live the life of self control.
('67', 392, 10, 28, 670732) Example is better than precept.
('67', 392, 11, 29, 670764) But the West asks us, Why is it that you have greater child mortality and
('67', 392, 12, 30, 670838) lower life average than we, though you regard yourselves as more spiritual than the
('67', 392, 13, 31, 670922) West? Do you believe in many children, Mahatmaji?
('67', 392, 13, 32, 670972) I believe in no children.
('67', 392, 14, 33, 670998) Then the whole race will be extinct.
('67', 393, 0, 1, 671035) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 394
('67', 393, 1, 2, 671077) It won't be extinct, it will be transformed into something better.
('67', 393, 1, 3, 671144) But it can never happen, for we have inherited from eternity the sex instinct from our progenitors.
('67', 393, 1, 4, 671244) It means a tremendous effort to check this habit of ages, and yet it is a simple effort.
('67', 393, 1, 5, 671333) Absolute renunciation, absolute brahmacharya is the ideal state.
('67', 393, 1, 6, 671398) If you dare not think of it marry by all means, but even then live a life of self control.
('67', 393, 2, 7, 671489) Have you any working method to teach this to the masses?
('67', 393, 2, 8, 671546) It is, as I said a moment ago, to attain complete self control and go and live that life amongst the masses.
('67', 393, 2, 9, 671655) A life of self restraint and denial of all luxuries cannot but have its effect on the masses.
('67', 393, 2, 10, 671749) There is an indissoluble connection between self control and the control of the palate.
('67', 393, 2, 11, 671837) The man who observes brahmacharya will be controlled in every one of his acts and will be humble.
('67', 393, 3, 12, 671935) I see what you mean.
('67', 393, 3, 13, 671956) The masses do not know the happiness of self control
('67', 393, 4, 14, 672009) and we have to teach them that.
('67', 393, 4, 15, 672041) But what about the argument of the West I referred to
('67', 393, 5, 16, 672095) before?
('67', 393, 5, 17, 672103) I do not think that we are more spiritually minded than the West.
('67', 393, 5, 18, 672169) If we were, we should not have fallen so low.
('67', 393, 5, 19, 672215) But because the average life of a Westerner is much higher than ours, it does not prove the spirituality of the West.
('67', 393, 5, 20, 672333) Whoever is spiritually minded must show a better, not necessarily longer, life.

('67', 393, 8, 23, 672468) The meeting of the Executive of the Harijan Sevak Sangh Board held from 30th August to 2nd September passed several important resolutons.
('67', 393, 8, 24, 672606) The following is one of them:
('67', 393, 9, 25, 672636) The question of decentralizing the finance and administration of the Sangh was discussed, in the presence of Sjt.
('67', 393, 9, 26, 672750) J. N. Kunzru, who was specially invited to attend this meeting of the Committee; the position with regard to U. P. (East) and the representations from the other provinces were considered.
('67', 393, 9, 27, 672938) At the end of the discussion Pandit Kunzru was requested to frame a separate scheme for U.P. (East) in consultation with his Provincial Board and District Committees by way of experiment and to submit it for consideration at the next meeting of the Executive Committee.
('67', 393, 10, 28, 673208) Another important resolution passed was the following:
('67', 394, 0, 1, 673263) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 395
('67', 394, 1, 2, 673311) Resolved that the [24th] 1 of September 1935, the day on which the Poona Pact was signed, be celebrated as the Harijan Day in accordance with instructions issued in that behalf by the Head Office, Delhi.
('67', 394, 1, 3, 673515) It is to be hoped that Harijan workers throughout India will make a special effort to establish closer contact with Harijans and that there will be an all round greater self dedication.
('67', 394, 1, 4, 673701) The third resolution of importance runs:
('67', 394, 2, 5, 673742) Resolved that efforts be made for the co ordination of the activities of the Charkha, Gram Udyog and Harijan Sevak Sanghs, and to secure that purpose it is suggested that a joint committee, consisting of the Secretaries of these sister organizatons, be created after getting constitutional recognition from the Charkha and Gram Udyog Sanghs.
('67', 394, 2, 6, 674084) Seeing that all the three activities are constructive and meet at many points, much time, energy and money can be saved and the work of the three organizations advanced if there is greater co ordination among workers wherever it is possible and desirable.

('67', 394, 4, 8, 674358) 613. PRIVATE PRODUCERS BEWARE
('67', 394, 5, 9, 674388) Whilst the new policy of giving an adequate wage to the spinners and others working at the manufacture of khadi is taking shape, the question of certified private producers of khadi comes up for serious consideration.
('67', 394, 5, 10, 674606) They are responsible for a large quantity of khadi.
('67', 394, 5, 11, 674658) The Association has a duty towards these no less than towards the wage earners.
('67', 394, 5, 12, 674738) The contracts made with them must be duly fulfilled.
('67', 394, 5, 13, 674791) But the duty ends there.
('67', 394, 5, 14, 674816) The whole organization of the Spinners Association is or should be run as a trust for the spinners whose lot must be progressively improved.
('67', 394, 5, 15, 674957) Private producers are certified primarily for the benefit of the spinners.
('67', 394, 5, 16, 675032) They should get their profit through the service of the latter, not at their expense, as we discover, they and others are doing.
('67', 394, 5, 17, 675161) But certificates issued to them need not be withdrawn if they will put themselves on a par with the direct agents of the Associaton.
('67', 394, 5, 18, 675294) But they will have to radically revise their method of work if they will do so.
('67', 394, 5, 19, 675374) They will have even to suffer loss.
('67', 394, 5, 20, 675410) They have to maintain in accordance with the requirements of the Association registers of the
('67', 394, 6, 21, 675504) 1 The source has.
('67', 394, 6, 22, 675522) 25th which was subsequently corrected by Gandhiji; vide Notes, 14 9 1935 and 21 9 1935.
('67', 395, 0, 1, 675610) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 396
('67', 395, 1, 2, 675652) spinners and other wage earners served by them.
('67', 395, 1, 3, 675700) They have to produce proof of payment of wages, collect and supply satistics regarding them.
('67', 395, 1, 4, 675793) This may be too onerous for them.
('67', 395, 1, 5, 675827) The risk entailed by the probable increase in the price of khadi may be too great to be borne by them.
('67', 395, 1, 6, 675930) The requirements of the Association may be too exacting for producers who have undoubtedly to work hard for making the profits they do.
('67', 395, 1, 7, 676066) Those who feel so, should from now begin to wind up their khadi business.
('67', 395, 1, 8, 676140) Those who wish to continue to do khadi work, should put themselves in touch with the agents of the Association.
('67', 395, 1, 9, 676252) Only they should know that the slightest neglect in the observance of the conditions will entail cancellation of certificates.
('67', 395, 1, 10, 676379) Loss or no loss, strictest honesty is the essential condition of continuation of their contract with the Association.
('67', 395, 1, 11, 676497) Only those therefore should continue who are lovers of khadi and devotees of Daridranarayana for whose sake they will not mind losses.
('67', 395, 1, 12, 676632) Those who are themselves not users of khadi in their own persons and homes need not entertain any hope of continuing the contract.

('67', 395, 3, 14, 676781) 614. LEPROSY AND ITS PREVENTION
('67', 395, 4, 15, 676813) Savli is one of the hives of khadi workers who are living in the midst of poor spinners and weavers.
('67', 395, 4, 16, 676914) Leprosy is rampant in Savli.
('67', 395, 4, 17, 676943) It is no wonder when these toilers have to slave to eke out a bare living, spinners getting no more than two pies at the most per hour.
('67', 395, 4, 18, 677079) Their average bill of fare is one rupee per month.
('67', 395, 4, 19, 677130) The workers inquire how they are to deal with the lepers, who mix with everyone without let or hindrance.
('67', 395, 4, 20, 677236) Many of them work for their living or help their relatives.
('67', 395, 4, 21, 677296) What is to be done with their manufacture?
('67', 395, 4, 22, 677339) How are they to serve these unfortunate countrymen?
('67', 395, 4, 23, 677391) The Indian Council of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Assocition has published a booklet called Leprosy Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention.
('67', 395, 4, 24, 677534) It is running its fifth edition.

('67', 396, 10, 14, 678333) This is merely a precautionary measure.

('67', 398, 6, 13, 681088) Your programme seems all right.
('67', 398, 6, 14, 681120) You are always free to come whenever you wish.
('67', 398, 6, 15, 681167) Why should you then wait for a letter from me?
('67', 398, 6, 16, 681214) Does a daughter ask her fathers permission every time she wishes to visit him?
('67', 398, 6, 17, 681293) Tell Gangabehn that I have no time and that, therefore, I am restraining my desire to write a long letter to her.

('67', 398, 11, 27, 681793) Perhaps you will recognize the person.
('67', 398, 11, 28, 681832) See if you can do anything.
('67', 398, 11, 29, 681860) I do hope your burden has lightened a little.
('67', 398, 11, 30, 681906) I have been hearing rumours about an indirect breach of the Poona Pact on the part of the Government.

('67', 399, 1, 2, 682147) 621. LETTER TO P. KODANDA RAO
('67', 399, 2, 3, 682177) WARDHA, September 10, 1935 DEAR KODANDA RAO,
('67', 399, 3, 4, 682222) The statement that I had derived my idea of civil disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong.
('67', 399, 3, 5, 682324) The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay of Thoreau on civil disobedience.
('67', 399, 3, 6, 682443) 1 But the movement was then known as passive resistance.
('67', 399, 3, 7, 682500) As it was incomplete I had coined the word satyagraha for the Gujarati readers.
('67', 399, 3, 8, 682580) When I saw the title of Thoreaus great essay, I began the use of his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers.
('67', 399, 3, 9, 682704) But I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle.
('67', 399, 3, 10, 682796) I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance.
('67', 399, 3, 11, 682845) Non violence was always an integral part of our struggle.
('67', 399, 3, 12, 682903) As per your advice, a copy is going to Mr. Pearson.
('67', 399, 3, 13, 682955) I hope you have done well.
('67', 399, 3, 14, 682982) Mahadev is in Bombay just now.
('67', 399, 4, 15, 683013) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI SJT.

('67', 399, 8, 20, 683191) I am not going to worry about Kumarappas temperature.
('67', 399, 8, 21, 683245) He is absolutely safe under Shummys care.
('67', 399, 8, 22, 683287) I do not remember having suggested your name to Rajendrababu.
('67', 399, 8, 23, 683349) If you really do not feel equal to the task, say so unhesitatingly.
('67', 399, 8, 24, 683417) If it is from the Congress standpoint that the pamphlet is required, you must not undertake the task.
('67', 399, 8, 25, 683519) If it is from the womans standpoint, I do not know anyone who can do it better than you.

('67', 400, 1, 2, 683884) myself dread your undertaking fresh burdens.
('67', 400, 1, 3, 683929) Therefore whilst from the latters standpoint I would like you to shoulder the burden, you shall be the judge as to whether you can spare the time.
('67', 400, 1, 4, 684076) It need not be a book.
('67', 400, 1, 5, 684099) A pamphlet of 25 pages octavo size compactly written would be quite good.
('67', 400, 1, 6, 684173) Of course you may write more, if you feel like it.
('67', 400, 1, 7, 684224) You shall have the paper as soon as possible.
('67', 400, 1, 8, 684270) The samples not yet received.
('67', 400, 1, 9, 684300) Did I tell you yesterday that Mira was on her back?
('67', 400, 1, 10, 684352) She has just been transferred to where Kumarappa was placed.
('67', 400, 1, 11, 684413) Amtul Salaam, tell Kumarappa, has now got her job and is now up and doing.
('67', 400, 1, 12, 684488) She has forgotten that she was sick only yesterday.
('67', 400, 1, 13, 684540) Please tell Ba, Laxmi is to be put up at the bungalow.

('67', 400, 6, 20, 684749) September 10, 1935
('67', 400, 7, 21, 684768) DEAR DR.
('67', 400, 8, 22, 684777) The cases of books have been delivered in good order and condition.
('67', 400, 8, 23, 684845) They have not been unpacked and will not be for a little time to come.
('67', 400, 8, 24, 684916) The portraits have also arrived safely.
('67', 400, 8, 25, 684956) I wrote to you hastily that they will be accommodated on the walls of the library, but it occurred to me at once that I was wrong in falling in with your proposal.
('67', 400, 8, 26, 685120) I have always dissuaded friends from entertaining the desire to associate such memorials with their gifts.
('67', 400, 8, 27, 685227) What is more, the regulation of the library will rest not with me, but with the trustees of whom I am not even one.
('67', 400, 8, 28, 685343) You will therefore pardon me for my hasty answer and let me revise it.
('67', 400, 8, 29, 685414) Will you be satisfied if I make some other good use of the portraits?
('67', 400, 8, 30, 685484) I have not discussed your proposal with the trustees though I mentioned it to Sjt.
('67', 400, 8, 31, 685567) Kumarappa, who agreed with my view.

('67', 401, 2, 3, 685726) September 10, 1935 CHI.
('67', 401, 3, 4, 685750) I had received the rakhadi in time.
('67', 401, 3, 5, 685786) I got the [hand made] paper made in Junnar.
('67', 401, 3, 6, 685830) It was good.
('67', 401, 3, 7, 685843) I have given the whole bulk to Khurshedbehn whose need was greater than mine.
('67', 401, 3, 8, 685921) The yarn being kept aside.
('67', 401, 3, 9, 685948) It attracts a good many peoples eyes.
('67', 401, 3, 10, 685986) And what will be the payment for my labour of spinning?
('67', 401, 3, 11, 686042) Whenever I can spin 160 rounds during a day, it is Diwali for me.
('67', 401, 3, 12, 686108) I have all along been under the impression that indigenous reed pens are available in plenty.
('67', 401, 3, 13, 686202) The one with which I am writing is believed to be Indian.
('67', 401, 3, 14, 686260) I will inquire.
('67', 401, 3, 15, 686276) Among the Socialists there are many good people, and some have the spirit of self sacrifice in them; there are some who possess a powerful intellect and some who are rogues.
('67', 401, 3, 16, 686450) Almost all of them have Westernized minds.
('67', 401, 3, 17, 686493) None of them knows the real conditions in Indian villages or perhaps even cares to know them.
('67', 401, 3, 18, 686587) Be thankful that your food was appreciated.
('67', 401, 3, 19, 686631) I do not recollect the name Lakshmibai Thunse 1. It is all right if Kaka has invited you.
('67', 401, 3, 20, 686721) Your duty, however, lies where you are.
('67', 401, 3, 21, 686761) 2 I have not changed my views.
('67', 401, 3, 22, 686792) Deo seems to be upset by the attempt to entice you.
('67', 401, 3, 23, 686844) Reassure him on my behalf.
('67', 401, 3, 24, 686871) He needs no such reassurance from you of course.
('67', 401, 3, 25, 686920) I also feel about Hitler nearly the same way as you.
('67', 401, 3, 26, 686973) If one point regarding my attitude is borne in mind, everything else will be clear.
('67', 401, 3, 27, 687057) I am indifferent about the time when the goal will be reached, but not at all about the work to be done and the good to be reached.
('67', 401, 3, 28, 687189) I say that I do not care whether the rich do or do not give up their wealth not because I am unconcerned whether or not they do so but because I have no fear that they will not do so.
('67', 401, 3, 29, 687373) If the steps we are taking are right, sooner or later they will lead to only one end.

('67', 402, 0, 1, 687689) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 403
('67', 402, 1, 2, 687737) The theory about man having descended from the ape does not convince me.
('67', 402, 1, 3, 687810) There is no doubt, however, that the soul which lives in the human body now has lived in the bodies of an ape and other animals in the past.
('67', 402, 1, 4, 687951) I do not like the argument that the atatayi 1 may be killed.
('67', 402, 1, 5, 688012) Who should be regarded as an atatayi?
('67', 402, 1, 6, 688050) For the present I do believe that murderers and other criminals will have to be imprisoned.
('67', 402, 1, 7, 688142) But I do not remember even having said that that is ahimsa.
('67', 402, 1, 8, 688202) I certainly do not believe that it is.
('67', 402, 1, 9, 688241) I have said that in the existing circumstances such action may be unavoidable.
('67', 402, 1, 10, 688320) This only means that my ahimsa is still far from perfect and that, therefore, I have not yet been able to discover a remedy for this kind of violence.
('67', 402, 1, 11, 688471) Truth lies in recognizing a fall from an ideal as what it is.
('67', 402, 1, 12, 688533) If we win power by any means other than ahimsa, the swaraj will most certainly not be the swaraj of the poor.
('67', 402, 1, 13, 688643) They will profit only in proportion to the degree of ahimsa we observe in winning swaraj.
('67', 402, 1, 14, 688733) Perfect ahimsa neither you nor I nor anybody else can claim.
('67', 402, 1, 15, 688794) But one who believes in ahimsa will become more and more non violent day by day and in consequence his field of service will keep ever expanding.
('67', 402, 1, 16, 688940) The field of service of the votary of violence will become narrower day by day and will ultimately become restricted to himself.
('67', 402, 1, 17, 689069) You have done well in inviting Kelkar.

('67', 404, 7, 30, 692053) MAMA, I have thrown your article into the waste paper basket.
('67', 404, 7, 31, 692115) There is no ban against efforts by the right type of men or women.
('67', 404, 7, 32, 692182) We cannot, however, get such workers by advertising for them in Harijanbandhu, nor do they grow in the [Harijan Sevak] Sanghs Office.
('67', 404, 7, 33, 692316) They emerge in answer to tapascharya.
('67', 404, 7, 34, 692354) Why dont you become one?

('67', 405, 2, 3, 692569) September 12, 1935
('67', 405, 3, 4, 692588) BHAI DILKHUSH,
('67', 405, 4, 5, 692603) Only today I have been able to read the question you have sent to Kishorelal.
('67', 405, 4, 6, 692681) The questions are good.
('67', 405, 4, 7, 692705) In fixing the wages for spinning by the poor students who spin for their own needs, you may make them as high or as low as you like.
('67', 405, 4, 8, 692838) If the khadi so spun is more than what they need, you can adopt the rate prevailing in any [khadi] association.
('67', 405, 4, 9, 692950) If it is sold in the market, it should be sold so as to help khadi sales.
('67', 405, 4, 10, 693024) If the spinning activity is merely [part time] for buying condiments or pan and bidis, the wages can be fixed quite low.
('67', 405, 4, 11, 693145) But if it is [a whole time activity] for buying ghee and milk, the rate of wage for an hours spinning should be sufficiently high to meet ones needs.
('67', 405, 4, 12, 693295) You may consider this a new theory, but according to me it is not.
('67', 405, 4, 13, 693362) It can be inferred from what I have written earlier.
('67', 405, 4, 14, 693415) So it is not a new theory and can be deduced logically from what has been stated as a premise.
('67', 405, 4, 15, 693510) Experience shows that thousands of women earn their livelihood from spinning.
('67', 405, 4, 16, 693588) When the question of fixing their wages came up, I had to say that they should at least be able to maintain themselves with that.
('67', 405, 4, 17, 693718) Or we should show them some occupation by which they can do so.
('67', 405, 4, 18, 693782) I think thiscovers answers to all your questions.
('67', 405, 4, 19, 693832) If not, by all means ask me again.

('67', 406, 3, 4, 694022) DEAR DAUGHTER, 2
('67', 406, 4, 5, 694039) All your efforts are in vain until you have been able to win over Kanam.
('67', 406, 5, 6, 694112) I dont think it will affect me, if anyone touches my feet.
('67', 406, 5, 7, 694171) But I want to put down this idolatry.
('67', 406, 5, 8, 694209) I do not regard myself so pure.
('67', 406, 5, 9, 694241) I see no benefit in cutting off the hair but you can certainly have it trimmed by someone if it comes in the way of your doing your work.
('67', 406, 5, 10, 694379) I do not accuse you of harbouring any impurity.
('67', 406, 5, 11, 694427) There can be no fear on my part if you find nothing wrong with yourself.
('67', 406, 5, 12, 694500) It is a matter of your own choice whether or no to go to Kanpur or any other place.

('67', 406, 10, 16, 694680) There is hardly anything I can suggest in this matter.
('67', 406, 10, 17, 694735) You can win him [Kanam] over only through love and this love will grow of its own accord.
('67', 406, 10, 18, 694825) Anyway, it is an old story.
('67', 406, 10, 19, 694853) There is nothing to write down.
('67', 406, 10, 20, 694885) Do on your own whatever you can do.

('67', 407, 3, 4, 695577) BRIJKRISHNA,
('67', 407, 4, 5, 695590) Your letter.
('67', 407, 4, 6, 695603) Your suggestion that the expenses should be reduced is quite pertinent.
('67', 407, 4, 7, 695675) Let Krishnan Nair remain in Calcutta for a year.
('67', 407, 4, 8, 695724) In the mean time you and Hardhyan Singh can do what you can.
('67', 407, 4, 9, 695785) Any enterprise that depends solely on one person is bound to break down ultimately, and how long can you keep Krishnan Nair in Delhi?
('67', 407, 4, 10, 695919) This time I chanced to notice the secret hatred K.N. bears towards the rich.
('67', 407, 4, 11, 695996) He too realized that his heart has yet to digest it.
('67', 407, 4, 12, 696049) What you write is quite correct.
('67', 407, 4, 13, 696082) His stay in Bengal should prove beneficial.
('67', 407, 4, 14, 696126) Gradually he will acquire mastery over everything.
('67', 407, 4, 15, 696177) Meanwhile the other Ashram inmates too will have been tested.
('67', 407, 4, 16, 696239) Only those can be defined as Ashram inmates who have no financial or any other kind of obligations towards parents and other relatives, whose wants comprise only food and clothing and who are ever alert in the observance of ahimsa and the other eleven vows.
('67', 407, 4, 17, 696497) That is why one who is inclined to put aside even the smallest amount is disqualified as an Ashram inmate.
('67', 407, 4, 18, 696604) Keeping this in view no one should be paid more than Rs. 10 and moreover anything saved over andabove food, etc., should be returned to the Ashram.
('67', 407, 4, 19, 696752) But we can employ on a salary those whose services are needed and who in spite of their spirit of service cannot, owing to their other obligations, work except on a higher remuneration.
('67', 407, 4, 20, 696938) We should strictly limit our expenditure in accordance with the sums available in the budget.
('67', 407, 4, 21, 697032) You can circulate this to all the workers currently employed.
('67', 407, 4, 22, 697094) This will shift the responsibility from your head and have the desired effect.
('67', 407, 4, 23, 697173) My health is satisfactory.
('67', 407, 4, 24, 697200) The diet consists of milk, vegetables and occasionally fruit.
('67', 407, 4, 25, 697262) Part of this letter has been written by me and the rest dictated, with many interruptions in between.
('67', 407, 4, 26, 697364) In the mean while Rajaji arrived yesterday and informed me of your having fallen ill; how is it?
('67', 407, 4, 27, 697461) I hope that you have recovered by now.

('67', 408, 10, 14, 698239) Rajaji is sitting by my side.
('67', 408, 10, 15, 698269) I read out your order 1 to him.
('67', 408, 10, 16, 698301) He says he must leave on the 17th at the latest.
('67', 408, 10, 17, 698350) Papa is expected in Madras and her son, who was ill, is eager to see him.
('67', 408, 10, 18, 698424) Rajaji thinks you want to talk to him about the crown of thorns 2 and says that, if it is so, your effort will be wasted.
('67', 408, 10, 19, 698546) He says he has given no assurance at all to Bhulabhai.
('67', 408, 10, 20, 698601) He is in no condition just now to accept the crown.
('67', 408, 10, 21, 698653) He is extremely tired both physically and mentally.
('67', 408, 10, 22, 698705) With his consent, I have written 3 to Jawaharlal and asked him.
('67', 408, 10, 23, 698769) All the same, it would be worthwhile if you can reach here by Monday.
('67', 408, 10, 24, 698839) We must let him go on Tuesday at the latest.
('67', 408, 10, 25, 698884) The weather here is none too good just now.
('67', 408, 10, 26, 698928) Mira is better, but she is having temperature since 2 oclock.
('67', 408, 10, 27, 698990) I inquired about the price of mosambis because, if they are available here at the same price, I should like to get them here itself.
('67', 408, 10, 28, 699123) You seem to have misunderstood my point regarding Sindi.
('67', 408, 10, 29, 699180) 4 We have no desire at all to force anything on the people.
('67', 408, 10, 30, 699240) We simply wish to go on working silently.
('67', 408, 10, 31, 699282) We shall discuss this further when we meet.

('67', 409, 4, 14, 700139) 635. DISCUSSION ON MINIMUM LIVING WAGEII 2
('67', 409, 5, 15, 700182) [Before September 14, 1935]
('67', 409, 6, 16, 700210) Our objective is as the name implies to represent the spinners who are the lowest paid labourers, i.e., to improve their lot.
('67', 409, 6, 17, 700336) Therefore we have to show a progressive improvement in their lot.
('67', 409, 6, 18, 700402) You must remember my earliest formula which holds good as much today as it did thena spinning wheel in every home and a loom or looms in every village.
('67', 409, 6, 19, 700554) That is the ideal of self sufficing khadi, and if I could take you with me I would have you serve the spinners not so much by selling their khadi as by making them prepare it for their own use.
('67', 409, 7, 20, 700748) 1 The name is omitted in the source 2 This is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter which gave the following summary of arguments by khadi workers : (1) It is wrong to say that we are exploiting the poor spinners.
('67', 409, 7, 21, 700968) On the contrary, the consumers who can easily purchase cheap Japanese and other foreign stuffs, go in for khadi which is dearer.
('67', 409, 7, 22, 701097) This is patriotism and not exploitation.
('67', 409, 7, 23, 701138) (2) The minimum wage may mean a few more coppers in the pocket of a very few, but what about the thousands who will find their occupation gone?
('67', 409, 7, 24, 701282) (3) The spinners themselves would far rather prefer a permanent small wage than a precarious higher minimum wage.
('67', 409, 7, 25, 701396) If a referendum were to be taken, they would cast their vote against the minimum wage.
('67', 409, 7, 26, 701483) (4) We have not reduced the spinners wage; the reductions in our prices are due to the fall in the price of cotton, and reduction in the weavers wages.
('67', 409, 7, 27, 701635) (5) It would have been possible to do something when the political situation was favourable, but at the present moment it is hardly the atmosphere.
('67', 410, 0, 1, 701783) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 411
('67', 410, 1, 2, 701831) make our own chapatis, there are no hotels in villages; in the same way all villagers should make their own khadi.
('67', 410, 1, 3, 701946) Not that some of them will not make extra khadi but that will depend only on the demand.
('67', 410, 1, 4, 702035) We shall certainly take orders from the city people who will want our khadi, and we shall get that khadi done by those who will get a wage per hour proportionate to their daily need.
('67', 410, 1, 5, 702218) This may mean a temporary rise in the present price of khadi.
('67', 410, 1, 6, 702280) We may no longer exploit the poverty of the people.
('67', 410, 1, 7, 702332) I have never said it was deliberate exploitation.
('67', 410, 1, 8, 702382) I take the fullest responsibility for allwe have done during the past fifteen years, and what we have done was inevitable.
('67', 410, 1, 9, 702505) But we have now to strike a new departure.
('67', 410, 1, 10, 702548) We have ignored the proletariat for centuries, and whilst we have arrogated to ourselves the right of commanding their labour, the thought has never crossed us that they have a right to dictate their wage, that labour is as much their capital as money is ours.
('67', 410, 1, 11, 702809) It is time we began to think in terms of their needs, their hours of work and leisure and their standard of living.
('67', 410, 1, 12, 702925) It is idle to argue that the spinners themselves would plump for a smaller wage for all than a higher wage for a few.
('67', 410, 1, 13, 703043) That is the argument of every exploiter and slave owner, and indeed there were unfortunate folks amongst slaves who hugged the chains of slavery.
('67', 410, 1, 14, 703189) But why should you fear that the majority of them will find their occupation gone?
('67', 410, 1, 15, 703272) Havent we other occupations to recommend them?
('67', 410, 1, 16, 703319) In Andhra, Sitarama Sastry has not hesitated to encourage them to prefer paddy husking to spinning as the former gives a better wage.
('67', 410, 1, 17, 703453) Let us not deceive ourselves.
('67', 410, 1, 18, 703483) We have made their necessity our opportunity, and have never looked at the question from their point of view.
('67', 410, 2, 19, 703593) Satisbabu had a fear that the minimum wage would open the door of fraudulent transactions.
('67', 410, 2, 20, 703684) That fear, said Gandhiji, was always there.
('67', 410, 2, 21, 703728) Without the minimum wage, had we not that trouble already?
('67', 410, 2, 22, 703787) That was a problem which had to be independently dealt with.
('67', 410, 2, 23, 703848) Gandhiji entirely agreed that the atmosphere of competition must disappear, and he was sure it would disappear as soon as the commercial spirit behind khadi disappeared.
('67', 410, 2, 24, 704018) Satisbabu was also anxious that in no case should the workmens minimum wage exceed the wage of an agriculturist.
('67', 410, 2, 25, 704131) There was no such thing as an agriculturists wage, explained Gandhiji.
('67', 410, 2, 26, 704202) In many parts of India the peasant hardly got out of his land enough to keep body and soul together, and the peasant who had no land of his own and cultivated it on lease produced not even enough to pay his rent.
('67', 410, 2, 27, 704415) Gandhiji said: The peasants condition is no standard.
('67', 410, 2, 28, 704469) The only standard is to get the daily bread.
('67', 410, 2, 29, 704514) To seek to pay anything less would be called criminal.

('67', 411, 2, 3, 704641) HARIJAN DAY
('67', 411, 3, 4, 704653) The Central Office of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has issued the following circular:
('67', 411, 4, 5, 704734) The Harijan Sevak Sangh will complete the third year of its existence by the end of September, and the Poona Pact agreed to by the leaders of caste Hindus and Harijans was signed at Poona on the 24th September 1932. It is therefore natural that the end of September, and more specially the 24th of September, should be considered an important date in the life of the Harijan Sevak Sangh.
('67', 411, 4, 6, 705122) The Executive Committee of the Sangh which recently met at Wardha has therefore resolved that the 24th September be celebrated both by caste Hindus and Harijans all over the country in the following manner:
('67', 411, 5, 7, 705329) (a) On that day all Harijan sevaks should visit Harijan bastis in the morning and speak to Harijans on the importance of sanitation and perform some personal service for them however small.
('67', 411, 6, 8, 705519) (b) In the evening Harijan and non Harijan children may be taken to open places for sports and entertainments.
('67', 411, 7, 9, 705630) (c) Processions, kirtan or bhajan parties may be organized.
('67', 411, 7, 10, 705690) Public meetings may also be held wherever possible and the solemn pledge of the Hindu community for the abolition of untouchability by birth reiterated.
('67', 411, 8, 11, 705843) (d) Association and sympathizers of the Sangh should be enrolled.
('67', 411, 9, 12, 705909) (e) Collections for the Harijan Wells Fundthe special feature of this years workbe continued with zeal and vigour.
('67', 411, 9, 13, 706024) I hope that the Sanghs appeal will receive ready response from all reformers, both Harijans and non Harijans, no matter to what party they belong.
('67', 411, 10, 14, 706171) WARNING TO HARIJAN BOARDS
('67', 411, 11, 15, 706197) Here is an extract from Shri Malkanis letter:
('67', 411, 12, 16, 706243) I am beginning to receive letters from Provincial Secretaries showing the difficulty of even raising 25 per cent of expenditure on welfare work out of fresh collections.
('67', 411, 12, 17, 706413) A copy of Sjt.
('67', 411, 12, 18, 706428) Gopalaswamys letter enclosed herewith shows the danger of laxity in collections.
('67', 411, 12, 19, 706509) On 22nd August, a sum of Rs. 81,455 10 2 was outstanding as advances to Provincial Boards representing, roughly speaking, two months expenditure of all Boards and their branches.
('67', 411, 12, 20, 706688) I am afraid several committees have already got into the habit of eating up
('67', 412, 0, 1, 706764) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 413
('67', 412, 1, 2, 706812) advances instead of making fresh collections.
('67', 412, 1, 3, 706858) If this tendency grows, as it may after 1st October next, a very difficult situation will arise, and without fresh advances heavy arrears may grow up in various centres so as to dislocate normal work.
('67', 412, 1, 4, 707059) In this, Assam is the worst sinner and should serve as a warning.
('67', 412, 1, 5, 707125) It was given the whole purse fund without any deduction and could get cent per cent on welfare out of the purse fund and two thirds grant on A & B. Yet it is in heavy arrears and has eaten up advances.
('67', 412, 1, 6, 707327) I shall be thankful if you kindly show the importance of vigilance with regard to our advances and fresh collections.
('67', 412, 1, 7, 707445) Hardly any comment on this is necessary.
('67', 412, 1, 8, 707486) Provincial Boards, District Boards and other branches will find themselves without resources if they sleep away during the time while there is something to go on with.
('67', 412, 1, 9, 707654) Fortune favours the vigilant, never the slothful.
('67', 412, 1, 10, 707704) I know that the Central Office will follow literally this very sound practice of fortune.
('67', 412, 1, 11, 707794) It is well, therefore, for all branches to be warned in time and find their own sinews of war.
('67', 412, 1, 12, 707889) They will find them by local collections if they can show solid work.
('67', 412, 1, 13, 707959) If they do not, it would be a sign to wind up work.
('67', 412, 2, 14, 708011) Harijan, 14 9 1935
('67', 412, 3, 15, 708030) 637. FALLACIES
('67', 412, 4, 16, 708045) A careful observer of events and things writes:
('67', 412, 5, 17, 708093) I have no doubt that there is an enormous scope for work in the directions indicated by you in your letter under reply.
('67', 412, 5, 18, 708213) Cottage industries have a place.
('67', 412, 5, 19, 708246) But, to be quite frank, I do not think that these can replace industries on a big scale.
('67', 412, 5, 20, 708335) Leaving aside the financial interests of those controlling such industries, I think that it will not be in the interest of the country to work for the ruin of such industries, which have been established and which can be established in this country.
('67', 412, 5, 21, 708585) The greatest objection to machinery that has been urged is the growing tendency to reduce the number of men employed.
('67', 412, 5, 22, 708703) This results in unemployment.
('67', 412, 5, 23, 708733) The present method of distribution of profits may require readjustment.
('67', 412, 5, 24, 708805) But leisure, if it can be well utilized, is more important than many other things.
('67', 412, 5, 25, 708888) Merely to keep a large number employed at work I do not think it is necessary to discard economic and efficient machinery.
('67', 412, 5, 26, 709011) It should be able to give leisure and food to many, and in this many I include people not even distantly connected with the industry.
('67', 412, 5, 27, 709145) With such a large population as in India and steadily increasing I fear that at no time will it be possible to keep everyone in reasonable comfort.
('67', 412, 5, 28, 709293) With improved education and sanitation life will be prolonged and death rate will come down.
('67', 412, 5, 29, 709386) From the
('67', 413, 0, 1, 709395) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 414
('67', 413, 1, 2, 709437) population point of view this will make the condition worse.
('67', 413, 1, 3, 709498) So, you will forgive my saying that the first thing that requires to be done is to take measures to restrict population and it cannot be done without birth control.
('67', 413, 1, 4, 709663) I know that you are against it.
('67', 413, 1, 5, 709695) But now that you are applying your mind solely to the problem of economic reconstruction by improvement in sanitation, food values, cottage industries, etc., I request you to consider if this is not also one of the things that should receive your attention.
('67', 413, 1, 6, 709953) The writer is an honest thinker and yet, as it seems to me, has missed the whole aim of the work being done by the two organizations he has in mind.
('67', 413, 1, 7, 710102) Their aim is not to replace or to ruin the big industries, but it is to revive the dead or dying industries and therethrough to find employment for the millions who are semi starved because they are forced to live in complete or semi idleness.
('67', 413, 1, 8, 710346) This is a constructive, not a destructive, programme.
('67', 413, 1, 9, 710400) The big industries can never, they dont hope to, overtake the unemployed millions.
('67', 413, 1, 10, 710483) Their aim is primarily to make money for the few owners, never the direct one of finding employment for the unemployed millions.
('67', 413, 1, 11, 710612) The organizers of khadi and other village industries dont hope in the near future to affect the big industries.
('67', 413, 1, 12, 710724) They may hope to bring a ray of light into the dark dungeons, miscalled cottages, of the villagers.
('67', 413, 1, 13, 710824) My esteemed correspondent seems to give up his whole case when he says leisure, if it can be well utilized, is more important than many other things.
('67', 413, 1, 14, 710974) The activities which he disapproves of are intended to accomplish the very end he has in view.
('67', 413, 1, 15, 711069) They are designed to well utilize the leisure hours of the idle millions.
('67', 413, 1, 16, 711143) In this there is no war against the misuse and abuse of machinery, i.e., its use to the detriment of the millions.
('67', 413, 1, 17, 711258) Dead machinery must not be pitted against the millions of living machines represented by the villagers scattered in the several hundred thousand villages of India.
('67', 413, 1, 18, 711422) Machinery to be well used has to help and ease human effort.
('67', 413, 1, 19, 711483) The present use of machinery tends more and more to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few in total disregard of millions of men and women whose bread is snatched by it out of their mouths.
('67', 413, 1, 20, 711675) The movement represented by the A.I.S.A. and the A.I.V.I.A. has been conceived so as to minimize the evil wrought by the craze for amassing large fortunes through the use of dead tools in order to avoid having to deal with very sensitive human tools.
('67', 413, 1, 21, 711926) The writer fears that at no time will it be possible to keep everyone in reasonable comfort.
('67', 413, 1, 22, 712019) This fear is not shared by those who
('67', 414, 0, 1, 712056) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 415
('67', 414, 1, 2, 712104) are working in the villages.
('67', 414, 1, 3, 712133) On the contrary, closer contact with the villagers andcloser knowledge of the villages fill them with the hope that if only the villagers can be induced to shed their traditional idleness they can all live in reasonable comfort, without causing any very great dislocation.
('67', 414, 1, 4, 712406) Certain oppressive conditions have no doubt to be abated.
('67', 414, 1, 5, 712464) But the process will almost be unfelt, if there is some co operation from what are termed vested interests.
('67', 414, 1, 6, 712572) The correspondents fear about the securing of reasonable comfort for the existing population leads naturally to the fear of over population.
('67', 414, 1, 7, 712713) The resort to birth control becomes more than the logical step.
('67', 414, 1, 8, 712777) Birth control to me is a dismal abyss.
('67', 414, 1, 9, 712816) It amounts to playing with unknown forces.
('67', 414, 1, 10, 712859) Assuming that birth control by artificial aids is justifiable under certain conditions, it seems to be utterly impracticable of application among the millions.
('67', 414, 1, 11, 713019) It seems to me to be easier to induce them to practise self control than control by contraceptives.
('67', 414, 1, 12, 713119) This little globe of ours is not a toy of yesterday.
('67', 414, 1, 13, 713172) In has not suffered from the weight of over population through its age of countless millions.
('67', 414, 1, 14, 713266) How can it be that the truth has suddenly dawned upon some people that it is in danger of perishing of shortage of food unless birth rate is checked through the use of contraceptives?
('67', 414, 1, 15, 713450) My fear is that my correspondent has led himself from one fallacy to another ending in the quagmire of contraceptives on a scale hitherto unknown.

('67', 415, 3, 4, 714062) MY DEAR AMRIT, Your unfailing full letters are a blessing to me.
('67', 415, 3, 5, 714127) With the two patients under your care I have no anxiety about them.
('67', 415, 3, 6, 714195) Please tell Pyarelal I have his letters.
('67', 415, 3, 7, 714236) I take him at his word and save time by not replying just yet.
('67', 415, 3, 8, 714299) Mahadev has not yet returned.
('67', 415, 3, 9, 714329) He may not before Monday.
('67', 415, 3, 10, 714355) Your reply to Dr. Gopichand Bhargava is quite correct.
('67', 415, 3, 11, 714410) I am destroying the letter as desired by you.
('67', 415, 3, 12, 714456) You must resolutely refuse to carry burdens you cannot bear.
('67', 415, 4, 13, 714517) Mira is still not out of the wood.
('67', 415, 4, 14, 714552) She had another restless night.
('67', 415, 4, 15, 714584) Nevertheless the fever is abating though slowly.
('67', 415, 4, 16, 714633) Rajaji is still here.
('67', 415, 4, 17, 714655) He will probably leave on Tuesday.
('67', 415, 4, 18, 714690) Laxmi and the new born are well.
('67', 415, 4, 19, 714723) Tara still has recurring fever.
('67', 415, 4, 20, 714755) And so has Manu.

('67', 415, 8, 29, 715119) You have a perfect right to write to me as you have now at last done.
('67', 415, 8, 30, 715189) You have a double claim upon me.
('67', 415, 8, 31, 715222) First because you are in an organization of which I am the head and secondly because you are connected with two persons who have for many years accepted my word as law.
('67', 415, 8, 32, 715391) In writing your letter, therefore, you have not only recognized your unadulterated right but you have also performed the duty which you owe to me.
('67', 415, 8, 33, 715538) That you have grievously erred in your writing does not in

('67', 416, 1, 2, 715749) any shape or form diminish the value of your letter.
('67', 416, 1, 3, 715802) On the contrary, the value is enhanced in that you have dared to tell me what you hold to be unadulterated truth although it may appear bitter to me and although I may consider it to be the reverse of truth.
('67', 416, 1, 4, 716010) Very often we mount to truth by wading through errors so long [as] they do not appear to us to be errors.
('67', 416, 1, 5, 716116) Your attachment as distinguished from affection for khadi has led you into a maze of errors.
('67', 416, 1, 6, 716209) All India Spinners Association is the head and the associations affiliated to it are the branches.
('67', 416, 1, 7, 716308) The head has rights which branches do not and cannot possess.
('67', 416, 1, 8, 716370) What appeared to me at one time a sound policy under given circumstances may prove unsound under altered circumstances or on a fuller perception of even same circumstances.
('67', 416, 1, 9, 716543) I would be an unworthy head of an organization if I sacrificed its interests for a seeming consistency.
('67', 416, 1, 10, 716647) Again the liberties that Baba and Ma have allowed me to take with them and their creation I may not take with others.
('67', 416, 1, 11, 716765) I would never be afraid of being misunderstood by them.
('67', 416, 1, 12, 716821) Every one of my actions in connection with Pratishthan, therefore, you have to interpret in the light of my relationship with Baba and Ma.
('67', 416, 1, 13, 716960) It is a relationship of their creation.
('67', 416, 1, 14, 717000) So much for the Pratishthan.
('67', 416, 1, 15, 717029) Now for my new experiment.
('67', 416, 1, 16, 717056) Since you admit that I am the creator of the khadi movement I must have the right to regulate its growth and even to destroy it.
('67', 416, 1, 17, 717185) He who creates can also recreate.
('67', 416, 1, 18, 717219) And if I found that I made a mistake in fashioning my creation I must have the right to refashion it in any manner I like so long as I carry with me my associates in nursing the creation.
('67', 416, 1, 19, 717407) You would admit that I would be a traitor to myown creation if for fear of the judgement of fellow workers like you I fail to act up to my own judgement if it abide in spite of the criticisms of fellow workers.
('67', 416, 1, 20, 717618) I think this covers all the points that you have raised.
('67', 416, 1, 21, 717675) You may write to me as often as you like till I have convinced you or till you despair of my ever succeeding in convincing you.
('67', 416, 2, 22, 717803) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI [PS.] I shall regard your letter as purely personal as desired by you.

('67', 417, 3, 5, 718090) DEAR DR.
('67', 417, 3, 6, 718099) GOPICHAND,
('67', 417, 4, 7, 718110) I have your belated reply.
('67', 417, 4, 8, 718137) But better late than never.
('67', 417, 4, 9, 718165) As for the funds which you claim as donations given to you personally, as I have not studied all the ramifications I would like you to abide by Shankerlals judgment.
('67', 417, 4, 10, 718331) Without admitting any error of judgment and without any reflection being cast upon you, you could simply get the funds converted into donations for the A.I.S.A. Rajkumari has decided to stop the khadi Bhandar in her own place.
('67', 417, 4, 11, 718558) Therefore the sooner we close the Simla Bhandar the better.
('67', 417, 4, 12, 718618) I shall be prepared to give Puri the training in self sufficient khadi whenever he could be conveniently sent.
('67', 417, 4, 13, 718729) I understand what you say about keeping the accounts in our Bhandars in Urdu and you are right in what you say.
('67', 417, 4, 14, 718841) I am carefully going into everything in connection with Harjivan.
('67', 417, 4, 15, 718907) Without perhaps meaning it, he succeeds in displeasing his associates.
('67', 417, 4, 16, 718978) I am trying to induce him to leave Kashmir work and take rest for the time .
('67', 417, 4, 17, 719055) he recovers, his services can be utilized for less .
('67', 417, 4, 18, 719108) I would, therefore, like you to give me your suggestion for the conduct of the Kashmir Bhandar and its branches .
('67', 417, 4, 19, 719222) your warning that all correspondenceand the questions regarding the management of khadi work in the Punjab should be through you, if you are to keep yourself in touch with the movement and are to be really responsible for its growth in the Punjab.
('67', 417, 4, 20, 719470) All Bhandars that are being run at a loss are certainly to be closed as quickly as possible, including, of course, the Peshawar Bhandar.
('67', 417, 4, 21, 719607) What you tell me about Khan Pirbux and Dr. Alam makes painful reading.
('67', 417, 4, 22, 719678) We have to cut our way through all weathers, fair or foul and rely upon Gods help in so far as we may be walking along the path of truth and love.

('67', 418, 4, 5, 720063) I have your letter and am glad you have at last seen Dr. Ambedkar.
('67', 418, 4, 6, 720130) He is right about the profession of law.
('67', 418, 4, 7, 720171) Only my conviction is that you will not be able to stand the strain of studies and I would not risk the sacrifice of your health upon any consideration whatsoever.
('67', 418, 4, 8, 720335) I do not share the fear he has about going to villages.
('67', 418, 4, 9, 720391) The Sangh will not endanger your health in the pursuit of the work that may be assigned to you.
('67', 418, 4, 10, 720487) Anyway if you are satisfied with social service, you should give this very good offer a trial.
('67', 418, 4, 11, 720582) The moment you find it uncongenial for your body you may give it up.
('67', 418, 4, 12, 720651) Of course you should dispel the fear of instability about the Sangh.
('67', 418, 4, 13, 720720) You will not be taking any permanent step.
('67', 418, 4, 14, 720763) You will be taking no risk if the Sangh is extinct.

('67', 418, 10, 22, 721109) But I hope everything is all right now.

('67', 419, 3, 4, 721310) MY DEAR GURJALE,
('67', 419, 4, 5, 721327) I have your letter.
('67', 419, 4, 6, 721347) It is very doleful.
('67', 419, 4, 7, 721367) You must not give in like that.
('67', 419, 4, 8, 721399) But your resolve, if it is not born of despondency, to remain in the Ashram and depend upon the friends sending help to you is admirable.
('67', 419, 4, 9, 721537) The indispensable condition is that you should keep cheerful, if they do not send a single pie to you.
('67', 419, 4, 10, 721640) You can appeal to your friends by letters and ceaselessly work up the institution there.
('67', 419, 4, 11, 721729) You should also undertake some labour which would be an encouragement to village industries and which would bring at the same time a little income.
('67', 419, 4, 12, 721877) If you can think out a good scheme it would be your deliverance.
('67', 419, 4, 13, 721942) One thing in your letter disturbs me.
('67', 419, 4, 14, 721980) You say that your wife who was your helper in every way has now turned against you.
('67', 419, 4, 15, 722064) What is the meaning of this?
('67', 419, 4, 16, 722093) Why should she turn against you?

('67', 419, 9, 22, 722286) DEAR FRIEND,
('67', 419, 10, 23, 722299) Many thanks for your letter.
('67', 419, 10, 24, 722328) I have suggested to Shri Trivedi that the money should be transferred to me and I shall at once proceed to form a Salukar Memorial Committee to give effect to the trust.

('67', 420, 4, 5, 722701) I am writing a separate letter to Father.
('67', 420, 4, 6, 722743) The leaflet about Rentia Baras 1 is well written, but I shall know what you can achieve through it only after I get a detailed report from you.
('67', 420, 4, 7, 722887) At present, the middle class does not seem to have much faith in khadi, though some individuals have certainly retained their faith in it.
('67', 420, 4, 8, 723026) I will be content if, in a town like Rajkot, you get a fairly good number of spinners.
('67', 420, 4, 9, 723113) If you are not using the equipment of the workshop lying there, I can easily make use of it here.

('67', 422, 4, 5, 725111) I have unwillingly begun to write in English.
('67', 422, 4, 6, 725157) Mahadev is returning tomorrow with Sardar and Ghanshyamdas.
('67', 422, 4, 7, 725217) You must be well and then quickly come here if you can.
('67', 422, 4, 8, 725273) Devdas cannot spare Pyarelal.
('67', 422, 4, 9, 725303) If you cannot come, I must send Mahadev to you.
('67', 422, 4, 10, 725351) You may not be deserted.

('67', 422, 11, 22, 725730) With the doctor in the house, I must not say Devdas should not be pressed to eat more than he wants to take.
('67', 422, 11, 23, 725839) Better to let him go slow.

('67', 423, 4, 20, 726870) If they are trained in the right way, they will learn by themselves whatever else they especially wish to when they are grown up.
('67', 423, 4, 21, 727000) Manilal must spare some time every day for them just as he spares some for eating.
('67', 423, 4, 22, 727083) Once a man forms rules for himself it is easy enough to follow them.
('67', 423, 4, 23, 727152) If you regard it as your duty to teach the children, as you regard it as your duty to do the work for Indian Opinion from week to week, you will be able to spare the time.

('67', 424, 7, 12, 728186) We cannot in a moment remove superstitions centuries old.
('67', 424, 7, 13, 728244) The peoples hearts, too, will not be prepared to take any note of us till we have performed some tangible service apparent to them.
('67', 424, 7, 14, 728376) The approach to their intellect is even more difficult.
('67', 424, 7, 15, 728432) The very spirit of ahimsa is a matter of the heart only, it touches the intellect in a much lesser degree.
('67', 424, 7, 16, 728539) Hearts can be reached soon enough by disinterested service.
('67', 424, 7, 17, 728599) Therefore our present duty consists of service among those making the goat offering to the goddeses and we shall as the occasion arises remove their superstition.
('67', 424, 7, 18, 728762) Keep in mind that the scene witnessed by you among the uneducated can be seen among the educated, too, in Calcutta and that on a vast scale.
('67', 424, 7, 19, 728903) The other incident also is of the same category 1 though not so painful or unbearable and the remedy is the same.

('67', 425, 3, 4, 729592) BRIJKRISHNA,
('67', 425, 4, 5, 729605) The question you have raised at this late date surprises me.
('67', 425, 4, 6, 729666) What is the meaning of absolution of sins?
('67', 425, 4, 7, 729709) Who is to absolve and why?
('67', 425, 4, 8, 729736) Such language is used only by those who have no doubts because in talking of absolution they imply purification of man.
('67', 425, 4, 9, 729856) But basically the effect of sin needs must be endured.
('67', 425, 4, 10, 729911) One who endures it intelligently does not sin again and becomes pure.
('67', 425, 4, 11, 729981) This is the meaning of being absolved.
('67', 425, 4, 12, 730020) Absolution can never mean that man may continue to sin and seek forgiveness over and over again.
('67', 425, 4, 13, 730117) One who has been forgiven does not sin again and, if he does, the absolution is no absolution.
('67', 425, 4, 14, 730212) Secondly, why must we regard every ailment as a visitation for our sins?
('67', 425, 4, 15, 730285) Why should we not regard it as a blessing of God?
('67', 425, 4, 16, 730335) That is, we can interpret both ways and improve ourselves either way.
('67', 425, 4, 17, 730405) Nair wrote to me, too.
('67', 425, 4, 18, 730428) I would not like to interfere any more.
('67', 425, 4, 19, 730468) You may yourself write to Nair.
('67', 425, 4, 20, 730500) If he is indispensable for the Ashram he may suspend the training and come away.
('67', 425, 4, 21, 730581) And if he comes he should be given complete authority and whatever financial assistance he may need.
('67', 425, 4, 22, 730682) Whatever is to be said may be said only by way of advice.
('67', 425, 4, 23, 730740) He may then act according to his judgment.

('67', 426, 2, 5, 731568) Your work in connection with Jawaharlals release was prompt and glorious.
('67', 426, 2, 6, 731642) As you very properly say, it was more humanitarian than political.
('67', 426, 2, 7, 731709) I am glad, too, that the authorities rose to the occasion and lost not a minute in granting adequate relief.
('67', 426, 2, 8, 731818) At this end, too, our machinery was set in motion.
('67', 426, 2, 9, 731869) The whole thing ended so well.
('67', 426, 2, 10, 731900) This release of Jawaharlal stands out prominently as the one bright spot on the black and mournful surface.
('67', 426, 2, 11, 732008) I know you do not want thanks.
('67', 426, 2, 12, 732039) You may have them by the train load if you want them.
('67', 426, 2, 13, 732093) I know this, that it would have been a severe disappointment to me if you had not acted as you did.
('67', 426, 2, 14, 732193) You have accustomed me to look for such prompt and decisive action on your part.
('67', 426, 2, 15, 732274) Do please, however, thank all those who helped you and made your difficult mission so completely successful.
('67', 426, 2, 16, 732383) You did well in flying to Badenweiler.
('67', 426, 2, 17, 732422) 1 I am eagerly looking forward to your description of the visit.
('67', 426, 2, 18, 732487) There can be no doubt that, if we really ever succeed in disturbing Gods plans and if God has any plans, these efforts resulting in Jawaharlals reaching there have prolonged Kamalas life.
('67', 426, 2, 19, 732675) I am old fashioned enough to believe that not a blade of grass moves but by His will.
('67', 426, 2, 20, 732761) Then, too, I can derive ample satisfaction in the knowledge that you and other friends conspired to fulfil Gods purpose and therefore whilst you were doing your duty angels above were saying, well done, well, done.
('67', 426, 2, 21, 732976) Ghanshyamdas had to leave this morning abruptly, for he received a telegram yesterday that his mother was suffering from fever.
('67', 426, 2, 22, 733104) He would otherwise have stayed here at least four days longer.
('67', 426, 2, 23, 733167) He was able, however, to give me a fair summary of his doings there.
('67', 426, 2, 24, 733236) Charlie must have told you all about the situation here.
('67', 426, 2, 25, 733293) I can add nothing to what he must have said.
('67', 426, 2, 26, 733338) I hope he benefited by the voyage.
('67', 426, 2, 27, 733373) He needed rest badly.
('67', 426, 2, 28, 733395) I wish so much that he would abide by the plans made here, namely, that he would live in Cambridge or some such place and busy himself in writing work of a permanent nature, holding himself at your disposal when there might be something on

('67', 427, 1, 4, 733793) I know what a weak spot he has for you.

('67', 427, 5, 11, 734020) I have your letter.
('67', 427, 5, 12, 734040) I shall say nothing on it.

('67', 427, 8, 17, 734288) It is bad thingthese continuous attacks for Vidya.
('67', 427, 8, 18, 734339) I hope that the special treatment at Delhi did good.
('67', 427, 8, 19, 734392) It would certainly be good if you could accept Valjis 2 invitation.
('67', 427, 8, 20, 734460) I am glad, too, that you have hope from your Harijan work in Karachi.
('67', 427, 8, 21, 734530) Personally I am opposed to taking cost of clothing for Harijans.
('67', 427, 8, 22, 734595) I refuse to treat them as forelorn paupers.
('67', 427, 8, 23, 734639) And when I have to provide anything in the shape of clothing, I always resort to khadi [but] it is not possible to lay down a law for all.
('67', 427, 8, 24, 734778) You must, therefore, use your own judgment in every case of this kind and do what appears to you to be proper or refer to Jairamdas 3. And when in doubt always err on the right side.
('67', 427, 8, 25, 734961) Love to you both.

('67', 428, 2, 5, 735412) I got your letter regarding Devchandbhai.
('67', 428, 2, 6, 735454) If I send that letter to him, he wouldnt meet you even if he otherwise had intended to do so.
('67', 428, 2, 7, 735548) I, therefore, wrote to him a separate letter.

('67', 428, 6, 12, 735759) September 20, 1935 CHI.
('67', 428, 6, 13, 735783) JAMNALAL, I hear that the date of your arrival here is being repeatedly postponed.
('67', 428, 6, 14, 735866) As that means a longer stay in Almora, I certainly like the postponement.
('67', 428, 6, 15, 735940) You do need rest.
('67', 428, 6, 16, 735958) Even there, however, you cannot have complete rest.
('67', 428, 6, 17, 736010) There are letters to be written and visitors to see.
('67', 428, 6, 18, 736063) Besides, you have to attend to the affairs of that place.
('67', 428, 6, 19, 736121) Nevertheless, the strain which you will have to bear here is certainly not there.
('67', 428, 6, 20, 736203) Hence, I would even like it if you stay there till the beginning of winter.
('67', 428, 6, 21, 736279) And winter there is famous.
('67', 428, 6, 22, 736307) The winter of Simla is even more famous, and in winter the cost of living there is much less than even in Wardha.
('67', 428, 6, 23, 736421) Bungalows can be rented almost for nothing.
('67', 428, 6, 24, 736465) Green vegetables, fruit, etc., are plentiful and cheap and the scenery is perfect.
('67', 428, 6, 25, 736548) The cold there is a creation of peoples imagination only.
('67', 428, 6, 26, 736606) Simla is less cold in winter than Lahore.
('67', 428, 6, 27, 736648) I would, therefore, give you leave to stay there even for the whole of winter.
('67', 428, 6, 28, 736727) I am sure you will do some work wherever, you are.
('67', 428, 6, 29, 736778) If you spend one whole year peacefully at a hill station, then I believe your ear complaint will be cured, Madalasas health will become perfect and even Janakimaiya will become an excellent rider, assuming that she does not have her bones broken meanwhile.
('67', 428, 6, 30, 737035) I would certainly like you to attend the meeting of the Spinners Association.
('67', 428, 6, 31, 737113) However, I would do without you if you are content not to attend.
('67', 428, 6, 32, 737179) We have had enough discussions about the new policy, and you can write to me from there and send your views.

('67', 429, 1, 2, 737330) If decisions about Khadi Pratishthan, Meerut and Kashmir remain to be taken, my views about these also have been formed.
('67', 429, 1, 3, 737451) You may send your views about them too, and then resign yourself to what happens.
('67', 429, 1, 4, 737533) There remains the meeting of the Congress [Working] Committee.
('67', 429, 1, 5, 737596) You need not attend even that.
('67', 429, 1, 6, 737627) However, I excuse you from all this on condition that you spend all the time at some hill station.
('67', 429, 1, 7, 737726) If you come down, then it will be your duty to attend both the meetings.
('67', 429, 1, 8, 737799) Didnt you go to Jullundur, as you had intended to do?
('67', 429, 1, 9, 737853) Radhakrishna 1 and Sardar believe that you did not.
('67', 429, 1, 10, 737905) Now Sardar will have to go.
('67', 429, 1, 11, 737933) Everything is going on well here.

('67', 429, 7, 23, 738521) I do wish that many people will join your yajna.
('67', 429, 7, 24, 738570) Those who do so will not only advance their own welfare but also that of the country to that extent.

('67', 430, 4, 5, 739039) Shankerlal has sent to me your letter addressed to him.
('67', 430, 4, 6, 739095) We have got three alternatives: 1. to close the shop if they attack, 2. to defend ourselves, 3. to seek police protection.
('67', 430, 4, 7, 739218) Since we cannot resort to the first two alternatives, only the third remains.
('67', 430, 4, 8, 739296) The fourth atlernative is to agree to a panch if they propose it.
('67', 430, 4, 9, 739362) But how can we hope for such good fortune?
('67', 430, 4, 10, 739405) If there is anybody in it 1 who has some sense of responsibility, we must persuade him to act in a straightforward manner.
('67', 430, 4, 11, 739528) There seems no need to remove anybody because he is in the Sevak Sangh.
('67', 430, 4, 12, 739600) Whether or not somebody is in the Sevak Sangh, if he does not abide by our discipline, we may remove him giving him the reason or without doing so.
('67', 430, 4, 13, 739748) In the end, however, the question may remain whether we will be able to get persons acceptable to us.
('67', 430, 4, 14, 739850) However, there should be no problem if we can find loyal persons.
('67', 430, 4, 15, 739916) If you wish you may continue to write to me.

('67', 431, 7, 9, 740346) SHARMA,
('67', 431, 8, 10, 740354) I have been unable to write to you after the letter addressed to Colombo, although there was hardly any occasion to write till you wrote from America.
('67', 431, 8, 11, 740505) But this is not the whole truth.
('67', 431, 8, 12, 740538) I always wanted to write to you but could not do so for sheer lack of time.
('67', 431, 8, 13, 740614) God alone knows when this will reach you.
('67', 431, 8, 14, 740656) I had your letter from Port Sudan and the one from Colombo too, both were pleasing.
('67', 431, 8, 15, 740740) May your days in America prove as pleasant as the recent ones.
('67', 431, 8, 16, 740803) I shall pursue the matter regarding the book you need.
('67', 431, 8, 17, 740858) I have a feeling that the book will hardly be needed after your arrival there.
('67', 431, 8, 18, 740937) Still, I shall enquire for it.
('67', 431, 8, 19, 740968) I had an extremely short letter from Draupadi and nothing since then, in spite of my writing to her.
('67', 431, 8, 20, 741069) Amtussalaam too feels strongly the absence of letters from her.
('67', 431, 8, 21, 741133) I suppose you are getting some letters.
('67', 431, 8, 22, 741173) Do tell me if you want me to do anything.
('67', 431, 8, 23, 741215) Regarding the books belonging to the Kanya Ashram I shall write after consulting Chhotelal.

('67', 432, 2, 3, 741678) A CORRECTION Prof.
('67', 432, 2, 4, 741697) Malkani writes saying that Harijan Day is to be observed not on the 25th but on the 24th instant as the Pact was signed on the date.
('67', 432, 3, 5, 741830) SILK AND WOOL Allied to and in support of pure khadi are the hand spun woollens and silks supported somewhat by the A.I.S.A., the former chiefly in, Kashmir, the latter in Bengal.
('67', 432, 3, 6, 742010) The question has arisen as to how far the rule of the minimum wage applies to wool and silk spinning.
('67', 432, 3, 7, 742112) The rule applies much more forcibly to them than to khadi.
('67', 432, 3, 8, 742171) They are still, thank God, able to stand on their own legs.
('67', 432, 3, 9, 742231) They permit one to charge a higher profit and thus help to reduce the price of khadi.
('67', 432, 3, 10, 742317) Therefore the payment of a fair wage to wool and silk spinners is an obligation which does not admit of shirking on any account.
('67', 432, 3, 11, 742446) The idea underlying the resolution of the A.I.V.I.A. and the effort being made by the A.I.S.A. is to ensure at least a subsistence wage to all the artisans and workmen coming under their sphere of work.
('67', 432, 3, 12, 742649) And seeing that the scale finally fixed will always be the minimum, the tendency wherever possible must always be to pay a higher wage than the minimum.
('67', 432, 3, 13, 742802) Hence it follows that no producers can be certificated by either Association unless they maintain an accurate register of all workmen served by them and can give satisfactory proof of their having given them the stipulated wage.
('67', 432, 3, 14, 743031) It follows also that no certified sale stores can stock woollens or silks that are not purchased from certified producers.
('67', 432, 4, 15, 743154) LATE JUSTICE RANADE ON THE SPINNING WHEEL A correspondent sends me the following interesting advertisement published by the late Justice Ranade on 9th December 1880:
('67', 432, 5, 16, 743320) Cotton grows in various parts of our country, and the industry of spinning yarn on the charkha (rahat) is carried on at various places on a large scale, since yarn spun on charkha has yet a vast demand.
('67', 432, 5, 17, 743523) Under the circumstances, improvement in the mode of spinning has immense

('67', 433, 1, 2, 743723) possibilities of doing good to the indigent and diligent.
('67', 433, 1, 3, 743781) Towards this end is this advertisement being published for a spinning machine with the following improvements:
('67', 433, 2, 4, 743892) 1. An apparatus, either as a part of the spinning machine itself or independent of it, for cleaning the cotton.
('67', 433, 3, 5, 744004) 2. The machine should yield at least five threads instead of one and thus should increase fivefold the total output.
('67', 433, 4, 6, 744121) 3. The yarn, besides being even, should be fine at least as much as the yarn woven into khadi; it may not be more coarse.
('67', 433, 5, 7, 744243) 4. The machine, besides being strong, should be simple and it must work smoothly and without break.
('67', 433, 5, 8, 744343) The machine is not required merely as a model (in a museum) but it must yield work in actual practice.
('67', 433, 5, 9, 744446) The machines (to the above order) that will be submitted before the 15th of May 1881 will all be examined by experts and prize of Rs. 500 will be awarded to the maker of one which will be approved by the examiners.
('67', 433, 6, 10, 744661) The said maker has to undertake to supply machines up to 25 in number at our demand for a fair price and also has to undertake guarantee to repair the machines if out of order within four months of their use.
('67', 433, 7, 11, 744870) Those, then, that mean to try this experiment should accordingly inform the undersigned in writing within two months from the date of this notice.

('67', 433, 12, 17, 745267) The Indian Press is requested to publish this advertisement in their papers more than once for giving it wide publicity.
('67', 433, 12, 18, 745388) As the late Gokhale used to say, nothing escaped Ranades eagle eye and nothing that would benefit the least of his countrymen was ever too trifling for his consideration.

('67', 433, 13, 20, 745578) 667. A RENUNCIATION
('67', 433, 14, 21, 745598) In 1891 after my return from England, I virtually took charge of the children of the family and introduced the habit of walking with themboys and girlsputting my hands on their shoulders.
('67', 433, 14, 22, 745786) These were my brothers children.
('67', 433, 14, 23, 745819) The practice continued even after they
('67', 434, 0, 1, 745858) VOL. 67 : 25 APRIL, 1935 22 SEPTEMBER, 1935 435
('67', 434, 1, 2, 745906) grew old.
('67', 434, 1, 3, 745916) With the extension of the family, it gradually grew to proportions sufficient to attract attention.
('67', 434, 1, 4, 746016) I was unconscious of doing any wrong, so far as I can recollect, till some years ago at Sabarmati an inmate of the Ashram told me that my practice, when extended to grown up girls and women, offended the accepted notion of decency.
('67', 434, 1, 5, 746248) But after discussion with the inmates it was continued.
('67', 434, 1, 6, 746304) Recently two co workers who came to Wardha suggested that the practice was likely to set a bad example to others and that I should discontinue it on that account.
('67', 434, 1, 7, 746467) Their argument did not appeal to me.
('67', 434, 1, 8, 746504) Nevertheless I did not want to ignore the friends warning.
('67', 434, 1, 9, 746563) I, therefore, referred it for examination and advice to five inmates of the Ashram.
('67', 434, 1, 10, 746647) Whilst it was taking shape a decisive event took place.
('67', 434, 1, 11, 746703) It was brought to my notice that a bright university student was taking all sorts of liberties in private with a girl who was under his influence, on the plea that heloved her like his own sister and could not restrain himself from some physical demonstration of it.
('67', 434, 1, 12, 746970) He resented the slightest suggestion of impurity.
('67', 434, 1, 13, 747020) Could I mention what the youth had been doing, the reader would unhesitatingly pronounce the liberties taken by him as impure.
('67', 434, 1, 14, 747147) When I read the correspondence, I and those who saw it came to the conclusion that either the young man was a consummate hypocrite or was self deluded.
('67', 434, 1, 15, 747299) Anyway the discovery set me athinking.
('67', 434, 1, 16, 747338) I recalled the warning of the two co workers and asked myself how I would feel if I found that the young man was using my practice in its defence.
('67', 434, 1, 17, 747485) I may mention that the girl who is the victim of the youths attentions, although she regards him as absolutely pure and brotherly, does not like them, even protests against them, but is too weak to resist his action.
('67', 434, 1, 18, 747702) The self introspection induced by the event resulted, within two or three days of the reading of the correspondence, in the renunciation of the practice, and I announced it to the inmates of the Wardha Ashram on the 12th instant.
('67', 434, 1, 19, 747932) It was not without a pang that I came to the decision.
('67', 434, 1, 20, 747987) Never has an impure thought entered my being during or owing to the practice.
('67', 434, 1, 21, 748065) My act has always been open.
('67', 434, 1, 22, 748094) I believe that my act was that of a parent and enabled the numerous girls under my guidance and wardship to give their confidences which perhaps no one else has enjoyed in the same measure.
('67', 434, 1, 23, 748284) Whilst I do not believe in a brahmacharya which ever requires a wall of protection against the touch of the opposite sex and will fail if exposed to the least tempation, I am not unaware of the dangers attendant upon the freedom I have taken.
('67', 435, 0, 1, 748527) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 436
('67', 435, 1, 2, 748569) The discovery quoted by me has, therefore, prompted me to renounce the practice, however pure it may have been in itself.
('67', 435, 1, 3, 748691) Every act of mine is scrutinized by thousands of men and women, as I am conducting an experiment requiring ceaseless vigilance.
('67', 435, 1, 4, 748819) I must avoid doing things which may require a reasoned defence.
('67', 435, 1, 5, 748883) My example was never meant to be followed by all and sundry.
('67', 435, 1, 6, 748944) The young mans case has come upon me as a warning.
('67', 435, 1, 7, 748995) I have taken it in the hope that my renunciation will set right those who may have erred whether under the influence of my example or without it.
('67', 435, 1, 8, 749141) Innocent youth is a priceless possession not to be squandered away for the sake of a momentary excitement, miscalled pleasure.
('67', 435, 1, 9, 749268) And let the weak girls like the one in this picture be strong enough to resist the approaches, though they may be declared to be innocent, of young men who are either knaves or who do not know what they are doing.

('67', 435, 4, 12, 749525) While it is true that it is difficult to keep gur for long time especially during the rainy season, I have been told by one who ought to know that rab, which the juice becomes before being boiled down to gur, will keep indefinitely and is supposed to become better for keeping.
('67', 435, 4, 13, 749803) This experiment is worth trying when the sugarcane season commences.

('67', 435, 6, 16, 750166) . The doctor had remarked : I wish you laid in your Harijan greater emphasis on the scientific value of gur.
('67', 435, 6, 17, 750275) It is in every way better than sugar, and ever so much cheaper than those foreign productsglucose and dextrose and what not.
('67', 435, 6, 18, 750400) The only disadvantage is that some of our things do not keep long .

('67', 436, 2, 3, 750548) WARDHA, September 22, 1935 MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, Your three welcome letters give us all accurate news about Kamala.
('67', 436, 2, 4, 750662) For the time being I expect you to follow up the practice.
('67', 436, 2, 5, 750721) I had telegraphed for daily wires because of the public demand.
('67', 436, 2, 6, 750785) But you were right in not sending any when there was no change.
('67', 436, 2, 7, 750849) You were right also in omitting the senders name.
('67', 436, 2, 8, 750899) Your presence there is a source of great satisfaction to your friends here as it is an elixir of life to Kamala.
('67', 436, 2, 9, 751012) I am not writing to her separately this air mail.
('67', 436, 2, 10, 751062) I am going to take up your manuscript presently.
('67', 436, 2, 11, 751111) I have no difficulty in agreeing with you in the enunciation of principles.
('67', 436, 2, 12, 751187) But when we descend to the concrete, we generally use the language I have used.
('67', 436, 2, 13, 751267) In the huge organization the Congress has become, no one man can hope to run the show.
('67', 436, 2, 14, 751354) But some one has to shoulder the burden.
('67', 436, 2, 15, 751395) And people want some guidance.
('67', 436, 2, 16, 751426) Hence my inquiry 1 .
('67', 436, 2, 17, 751447) If you are elected, you will beelected for the policy and principles you stand for.
('67', 436, 2, 18, 751531) I would like you therefore to tell me whether you will allow your name to be proposed for the crown of thorns.
('67', 436, 3, 19, 751642) I suppose Indira will now wait till Kamalas condition is better known.
('67', 436, 3, 20, 751713) I am sending the Congress Constitution.
('67', 436, 3, 21, 751753) 3 If you can concentrate your attention on it, I would like you to send me your considered criticism on it.
('67', 436, 3, 22, 751861) As to the present policy of the Congress, whilst I can in no way be responsible for the detailed working of it, it is in the main of my shaping.
('67', 436, 3, 23, 752006) It is not one of drift.
('67', 436, 3, 24, 752030) It is founded upon one central idea that of consolidating the power of the people with a view to peaceful action.
('67', 436, 3, 25, 752144) But in your absence, we have been literally trekking.
('67', 436, 3, 26, 752198) Now that you are free you have to give the guidance and take with you such of your old colleagues as would go with you whole heartedly.
('67', 436, 3, 27, 752334) So far as I know they will not resist you, even where they may not be able to follow you.
('67', 436, 3, 28, 752424) I must not weary you with more of this kind of thing

('67', 437, 8, 20, 753559) Does he have any money?
('67', 437, 8, 21, 753583) Is it invested in the Bhandar?
('67', 437, 8, 22, 753614) At one time I think he had invested his money in it.
('67', 437, 8, 23, 753667) What post has he been given now?
('67', 437, 8, 24, 753700) Does it carry a salary of Rs. 80?
('67', 437, 8, 25, 753734) If he were not employed in that post could he earn that much or more elsewhere?
('67', 437, 8, 26, 753814) I can arrive at a decision if I know all this in detail.
('67', 437, 8, 27, 753871) Write to me whatever you wish without hesitation.
('67', 437, 8, 28, 753921) If you wish, you may show this letter to Bhai Vithaldas and Vallabhdas.
('67', 437, 8, 29, 753993) They too, if they wish, may write to me about this.

('67', 438, 3, 5, 754280) SOKHEYS NOTES ON SNAKE POISONING
('67', 438, 4, 6, 754313) NATURE OF POISONS
('67', 438, 5, 7, 754331) The colubrine poison (that of the cobra and krait) acts chiefly on the brain and spinal cord, causing death by paralysis of the respiratory centre in the brain.
('67', 438, 6, 8, 754492) Viperine poisons produce their effect on the heart and blood, death being caused by paralysis of the vasomotor centre, exhaustion from profuse and persistent bleeding, or from blood poisoning due to septic infection of the wound.
('67', 438, 7, 9, 754722) SYMPTOMS OF POISONING
('67', 438, 8, 10, 754744) COBRA VENOM.
('67', 438, 8, 11, 754757) Earliest constitutional symptom is one of intoxication.
('67', 438, 8, 12, 754813) Later, there is a sense of creeping paralysis, beginning in the legs and ascending to the head by way of the trunk.
('67', 438, 8, 13, 754929) The head droops and there is paralysis of the muscles of the eyelids, lips, tongue and throat.
('67', 438, 8, 14, 755024) Saliva dribbles from the mouth and speech becomes increasingly difficult.
('67', 438, 8, 15, 755098) Nausea and vomiting frequently occur.
('67', 438, 8, 16, 755136) The breathing gets more and more difficult till it finally ceases, the face being livid and distressed and swallowing impossible.
('67', 438, 8, 17, 755266) The heart remains unaffected and continues to beat after respiration has failed.
('67', 438, 8, 18, 755347) Death usually takes place in from one and a half to six hours.
('67', 438, 9, 19, 755410) KRAIT VENOM.
('67', 438, 9, 20, 755423) Death primarily due to suffocation, but, in addition, haemorrhages into stomach and bowels may occur, accompanied in many cases with violent abdominal pain.
('67', 438, 10, 21, 755580) VIPER VENOM.
('67', 438, 10, 22, 755593) Prevents clotting of the blood and destroys the internal coats of the blood vessels, thus encouraging haemorrhages in various parts of the body.
('67', 438, 10, 23, 755738) The wound inflicted is painful, the parts much swollen; bleeding occurs with great infiltration and discoloration, and, lastly, sloughing occurs permitting infection.
('67', 438, 10, 24, 755905) Nausea and vomiting frequently occur, but there is no paralysis.
('67', 438, 11, 25, 755970) TREATMENT
('67', 438, 12, 26, 755980) The bite of a venomous snake is unmistakably due to fang punctures.
('67', 438, 12, 27, 756048) If nothing happens within ten minutes the snake may be taken as harmless, for the bite from a poisonous snake develops a burning pain and swelling rapidly.
('67', 438, 12, 28, 756204) In half an hour or less,profuse sweating and vomiting may supervene.
('67', 438, 12, 29, 756273) By this time, of course, treatment should have been given, specially antivenene serum.
('67', 438, 12, 30, 756360) The latter can be injected before a condition of collapse has set in; the earlier the better.
('67', 438, 12, 31, 756454) Treatment would probably be possible in the following order only, as medical aid is not usually at hand.
('67', 439, 0, 1, 756559) 440 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('67', 439, 1, 2, 756601) 1. LIGATURE.
('67', 439, 1, 3, 756614) If the patient is bitten on a limb, apply a ligature above the bite.
('67', 439, 1, 4, 756683) It should compress all the tissues against a single bone, e.g., in bites on a finger the ligature should be applied on the base of the finger with a second perhaps above the elbow; in case of bite on a toe apply one ligature round the base of the toe and a second above the knee.
('67', 439, 1, 5, 756963) The ligature should be slackened off about every ten minutes and suction repeated as below.
('67', 439, 1, 6, 757055) Such ligation should not be kept on for much over half an hour but mechanical suction should continue at intervals for some hours.
('67', 439, 2, 7, 757186) 2. INCISION.
('67', 439, 2, 8, 757199) The fang should be opened with extensive incisions across, deep enough but with care not to injure the delicate skin covering the bone or to cut into a blood vessel.
('67', 439, 2, 9, 757365) A safety razor blade, if possible, sterilized by rapidly passing through a flame, may be used.
('67', 439, 3, 10, 757460) 3. DRAINAGE.
('67', 439, 3, 11, 757473) By cupping, if possible, or by sucking with lips (no danger involved if mouth free from sores.)
('67', 439, 4, 12, 757569) 4. INJECTION OF ANTIVENENE SERUM.
('67', 439, 4, 13, 757603) This may be injected as soon as medical aid is available.
('67', 439, 4, 14, 757661) This serum is sold by the Central Research Institute, Kasauli.
('67', 439, 5, 15, 757724) 5. SUPPLEMENTARY.
('67', 439, 5, 16, 757742) It is advisable to wash the incised wound with a mild solution of permanganate of potash (pale pink colour).
('67', 439, 5, 17, 757851) Do not apply permanganate crystals directly nor cauterize the wound.

('67', 439, 10, 22, 758038) MY DEAR JAWAHARBHAI,
('67', 439, 11, 23, 758059) I am writing this from Anand Bhawan, where, like half a dozen others, I made a vain dash to meet you.
('67', 439, 11, 24, 758161) Sarupbehns telegram of the 3rd saying you were to take the Dutch air mail on Friday reached Wardha on the 4th, as also yours of the 3rd.
('67', 439, 11, 25, 758298) That moment Bapu decided I must leave the same evening for Allahabad and take the chance of seeing you for no matter how brief an interval.

('67', 440, 1, 4, 759090) By the time you return we hope to be making much superior stuff and you will have samples when you come to Wardha.
('67', 440, 2, 5, 759205) There were two messages of some importance that I had brought from Bapu: (1) That Bapu wished very much that you could assume the Congress helm next year.
('67', 440, 2, 6, 759360) When he made the suggestion to the Working Committee it was unanimously accepted, and it was the general feeling that that was the only way in which much of the difficulties of the Working Committee and the bitter controversies of today could be avoided and your policy and your programme could be given a fair and unobstructed trial.
('67', 440, 2, 7, 759695) The new Constitution enables you to have your own Cabinet, and those who were out would give as much co operation as they could possibly give, but would place no obstacles in your way.
('67', 440, 2, 8, 759880) (2) That you should even in Europe make no speeches or statement.
('67', 440, 2, 9, 759946) Bapu was sure it would enhance your prestige and Indias to impose upon yourself a vow of silence until February or until your return here.
('67', 440, 3, 10, 760085) Besides these two messages, he was anxious to have your usually frank and outspoken views on: (1) the Village Industries Association work that was absorbing all Bapus time; (2) Bapus views regarding Council entry; (3) the present Congress Constitution.
('67', 440, 3, 11, 760338) Bapu himself had no doubt that it was a most effective instrument of our progress and that though there was a lot of corruption in the shape of manipulation of figures, etc., it was capable of being used to prepare the country for a final and successful effort for achieving freedom; (4) the question of the minimum wage; (5) the Socialists programme and their methods of work.
('67', 440, 4, 12, 760716) Though the progress of the constructive programme was slow, Bapu was getting more and more confirmed in his conviction that nothing else could qualify us for the final successful satyagraha compaign, for nothing heroic could be done unless we had won the hearts of the masses and this was impossible without intense constructive work in their midst enabling them to earn more and to live better.
('67', 440, 5, 13, 761112) Thats about all that I was charged with.
('67', 440, 5, 14, 761153) We shall expect a cable from you regarding Kamalabehns condition as soon as you are with her.
('67', 440, 5, 15, 761247) You will not think of replying to this until she feels fit and you may not send any reply at all if you can look forward to an early return.
('67', 440, 6, 16, 761388) With much love,

('67', 441, 2, 3, 761538) LETTER FROM A. DONALD MILLER 1
('67', 441, 3, 4, 761569) [Before September 14, 1935]
('67', 441, 4, 5, 761597) Mr. Sharpe has passed to me your letter to him of 2nd July, in which you asked his opinion about procreation of children by those suffering from leprosy, and you made reference to the Home at Naini, Allahabad, where you gathered from Mrs. Higginbottom that that was permitted.
('67', 441, 5, 6, 761874) You will be the first to realize how many questions are involved, medical, social, economic and spiritual.
('67', 441, 5, 7, 761981) What is ideal and what is practical are courses that are not always identical.
('67', 441, 5, 8, 762060) We have to arrive at the best possible course in a world as it is, and not as we would like it to be .
('67', 441, 6, 9, 762163) At a conference held under the auspices of the Mission at Allahabad in 1924, and attended by medical experts as well as by administrators of large leper institutions, the following were among the findings of the Medical Committee, and approved by the Conference:
('67', 441, 7, 10, 762426) (a) That the disease has not been proved to be congenital, but childhood is the period of greatest liability to infection.
('67', 441, 7, 11, 762549) It has been found that children separated from leprous parents at birth and thereafter protected from the possibility of infection do not develop the disease.
('67', 441, 7, 12, 762708) These facts make strongly advisable the earliest possible separation of infants and children from such leper parents as have the disease in an infectious form.
('67', 441, 8, 13, 762868) (b) That in view of the considerable degree of fecundity of lepers, especially of females, and the excessive danger of infection to the children of lepers, both of which play a great part in maintaining the prevalence of the disease, the separation of the sexes is desirable as far as possible.
('67', 441, 8, 14, 763163) Where this is not found to be practicable married lepers should only be allowed to live together on the express understanding that any children born to them shall be separated from their infected parents at the earliest possible age.
('67', 441, 8, 15, 763397) It is also especially desirable to separate parents presenting good prospects of recovery under efficient treatment, both to eliminate the risk of the healthy mate becoming infected while the partner is undergoing treatment and because child bearing is often accompanied by rapid development of the disease.
('67', 441, 9, 16, 763705) More recent investigation has gone to strengthen the view that both for the leper mother and for her child, procreation is not to be encouraged.
('67', 441, 9, 17, 763850) The mother is subject to strain that gives the disease an opportunity of developing; the child is

('67', 442, 1, 2, 764074) subject to grave and constant risk of infection so long as he is with the mother, if she has the disease in its contagious stage .
('67', 442, 2, 3, 764205) When we touch the spiritual issue we reach ground where it is not easy to dogmatize.
('67', 442, 2, 4, 764290) Yet I think it is clear that the highest solution of the problem raised lies in spiritual realms.
('67', 442, 2, 5, 764388) Sacrifices of one kind and another are called for by all in the building up of a nobler future; individual sacrifice is of the very bone and marrow of the common good.
('67', 442, 2, 6, 764556) And the sacrifice that is demanded of a man or woman, depending upon Gods grace and seeking His will, who has leprosy is to refrain from imperilling future lives by any personal gratification.
('67', 442, 3, 7, 764749) So that we arrive, quite decisively I feel, at the conclusion that ideally it is neither well medically, socially, nor spiritully for there to be cohabitation of destitute lepers in institutions, where it leads to the procreation of children.
('67', 442, 4, 8, 764992) But I said that what is ideal and what is practical are courses that are not always identical, and so it comes about that sometimes, while the Mission to Lepers has as its definite policy the non provision of married quarters for those who come voluntarily to us and who are our guests, circumstances have sometimes made this policy incapable of complete adoption .
('67', 442, 5, 9, 765358) At Allahabad which you mention in your letter married quarters do continue for those already occupying them, but the weight of evidence is clearly that such quarters are not serving the highest good, and so for fresh admissions provision is only made for them in either the mens or the womens separate quarters.
('67', 442, 6, 10, 765670) Where patients come to an institution under legal compulsion, the issue would be somewhat altered, at any rate on the social score.
('67', 442, 6, 11, 765802) Then it would be a case of a community definitely taking the responsiblity for governing the lives of others.
('67', 442, 6, 12, 765912) But in all Mission institutions in India patients come voluntarily, and are our guests and not our prisoners.
('67', 442, 6, 13, 766022) And just as you at your old Ashram at Sabarmati had principles to be observed by your guests calculated to achieve the highest good, so we at our institutions are endeavouring, so far as is possible, to achieve the greatest good by a policy which will, as far as is practical, not encourage the procreation of children by leper parents.
('67', 442, 7, 14, 766359) Have I made our difficulties and our ideals clear?
('67', 442, 7, 15, 766410) I hope so.

('67', 443, 3, 4, 766537) WARDHA, September 25, 1935 MY DEAR JAWAHARLALJI,
('67', 443, 4, 5, 766586) Bapuji is too busy to write today and so I am writing instead.
('67', 443, 4, 6, 766649) There has been no news from you for some days, and we take it that no news is good news.
('67', 443, 4, 7, 766738) Progress is bound to be painfully slow, but we trust your presence will act as an infallible medicine.
('67', 443, 4, 8, 766841) And what a comfort it must be to Indu who would hardly have borne the strain without you.
('67', 443, 5, 9, 766931) My dash to Allahabad to see you was not valueless, for I was the privileged bearer of your valuable manuscript.
('67', 443, 5, 10, 767043) I read three parts (about 275 pages) on the way and was in raptures over them.
('67', 443, 5, 11, 767122) Work here has prevented me from further progress, but Khorshed has finished it and Bapu has now started on it.
('67', 443, 5, 12, 767233) He finished the 1st part today and hopes to get through it soon.
('67', 443, 5, 13, 767298) Of course he does all this reading in what he calls the Library (meaning the W. C.!).
('67', 443, 5, 14, 767384) You will be amused to hear that the only book which shares the W. C. shelf, with your manuscript, is a biography of Hitler!
('67', 443, 5, 15, 767508) He finished Hitlers autobiography (My Struggle) some days ago.
('67', 443, 6, 16, 767571) Yours affectionately, MAHADEV
('67', 443, 8, 17, 767601) The Congress Constitution is accompanying this.

('67', 443, 13, 22, 767824) I am afraid Bapu must miss todays airmail, too.
('67', 443, 13, 23, 767872) There has been a number of visitors and just at the present moment when the post must be sent he is spinning and giving an interview.
('67', 443, 13, 24, 768006) But he asked me, interrupting the interview for a second, that I must acknowledge your important letter received yesterday dated September 20 and tell you how happy he is that you have been able to communicate your decision 3. No

('67', 444, 1, 3, 768480) Bapu is regularly reading the Magnum Opus 1and today he has finished the second part.
('67', 444, 1, 4, 768566) There are eight parts, but Upadhyaya gave me only seven.
('67', 444, 1, 5, 768623) The eighth was not yet ready when I left Allahabad, and Kripalani who comes here for the A.I.S.A. meeting on the 10th will bring the eighth part.
('67', 444, 2, 6, 768769) Yours affectionately, MAHADEV
('67', 444, 4, 7, 768799) The other letter giving detailed news of Kamala's health also arrived yesterday.
