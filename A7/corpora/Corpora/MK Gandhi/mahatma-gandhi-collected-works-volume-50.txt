('50', 1, 8, 18, 1859) YERAVDA MANDIR, August 24, 1930
('50', 1, 9, 19, 1891) MIRA, I have your love letter written during your journey to Madras.
('50', 1, 9, 20, 1960) I am hoping that this strain will not prove too much for you.
('50', 1, 9, 21, 2022) Your descriptions are all valuable.
('50', 1, 9, 22, 2058) Yes, I had a strenuous time during the Nehrus visit.
('50', 1, 9, 23, 2111) It was with difficulty that I was able to spin 375 rounds without doing which I should feel most unhappy.
('50', 1, 9, 24, 2217) The box wheel is working very well and undoubtedly causes less strain.
('50', 1, 9, 25, 2288) It gives more satisfactory work now that I have put on it the thin mal you sent me.
('50', 1, 9, 26, 2372) The thick mal was causing trouble.
('50', 1, 9, 27, 2407) The carding bow is working to perfection.
('50', 1, 9, 28, 2449) It imposes no strain on me.
('50', 1, 9, 29, 2477) Kakasaheb rolls the slivers.
('50', 1, 9, 30, 2506) He has yet to learn carding which he proposes to begin shortly.
('50', 1, 9, 31, 2570) The translation of the bhajans continues as before regularly but slowly

('50', 2, 1, 2, 2684) and I see no immediate chance of greater output.
('50', 2, 1, 3, 2733) I am keeping well.
('50', 2, 1, 4, 2752) The weight fluctuates.
('50', 2, 1, 5, 2775) Last week I regained one pound out of two or three I seemed to have lost.
('50', 2, 1, 6, 2849) There has been no loss of energy.
('50', 2, 1, 7, 2883) The water here is hard and therefore constipation requires a little handling.
('50', 2, 1, 8, 2961) BAPU [PS.] You will be glad to know that the tant has not once broken.

('50', 2, 5, 12, 3153) PRABHAVATI, I didnt see any letter from you in the mail this week.
('50', 2, 5, 13, 3220) You must have received my letters to Jayaprakash and to you.
('50', 2, 5, 14, 3281) My weight, which was going down, has again increased by one pound.
('50', 2, 5, 15, 3348) What is your daily programme of work these days?
('50', 2, 5, 16, 3397) Vallabhbhai told me that Jayaprakash was not in good health.
('50', 2, 5, 17, 3458) How is that?

('50', 2, 7, 21, 3641) Is it out of compassion for me or through laziness?
('50', 2, 7, 22, 3693) If you had compassion for me, you would write to me.
('50', 2, 7, 23, 3746) How is Sita?
('50', 2, 7, 24, 3759) Why does she fall ill so often?
('50', 2, 7, 25, 3791) I hope you are not being miserly about fruit.
('50', 2, 7, 26, 3837) What is the condition of your ears?
('50', 2, 7, 27, 3873) How do you keep generally?
('50', 2, 7, 28, 3900) How is Tara?
('50', 2, 7, 29, 3913) How is Nanabhais health?
('50', 2, 7, 30, 3938) Think about other similar questions yourself.
('50', 2, 7, 31, 3984) I hope you, always find Manilal with a smile on his face and joking.
('50', 2, 7, 32, 4053) Does he read anything in jail?

('50', 3, 3, 7, 4354) How did you spend the time?
('50', 3, 3, 8, 4382) Were you lazy?
('50', 3, 3, 9, 4397) Were you talkative?

('50', 3, 8, 17, 4645) I have preserved your last letter.
('50', 3, 8, 18, 4680) I did not reply to it.
('50', 3, 8, 19, 4703) But after reading about your heroism I cannot help writing.
('50', 3, 8, 20, 4763) Deal patiently with the situation.
('50', 3, 8, 21, 4798) I would advise you not to do anything on an impulse.
('50', 3, 8, 22, 4851) Does it need mentioning that pure sacrifice calls for careful thought, a sense of discrimination, restraint and patience?
('50', 3, 8, 23, 4973) Since Khurshedbehn was with you, I felt reassured and satisfied.
('50', 3, 8, 24, 5038) Blessings from both of us.

('50', 4, 2, 3, 5216) YERAVDA MANDIR, August 24/26, 1930
('50', 4, 3, 4, 5251) NARANDAS, This time I got the letters earlier than usual, that is, on Wednesday instead of on Thursday.
('50', 4, 3, 5, 5355) Among the letters is one for Satis Babu.
('50', 4, 3, 6, 5396) He is Krishnadass guru, Satis Mukherjee.
('50', 4, 3, 7, 5437) His address is Harra Road, Calcutta.
('50', 4, 3, 8, 5474) I have forgotten the number of the flat.
('50', 4, 3, 9, 5515) You will find it somewhere in my papers.
('50', 4, 3, 10, 5556) Surendra is likely to know it.
('50', 4, 3, 11, 5587) Or you will get it in the Ashram office itself.
('50', 4, 3, 12, 5635) How is Devdass health?
('50', 4, 3, 13, 5658) Tell him that I often think of him.
('50', 4, 3, 14, 5694) Has Ramdass health recovered?
('50', 4, 3, 15, 5724) I have before now asked for the names of those who have been released.
('50', 4, 3, 16, 5795) It would be better if against each name the quantity of carding and spinning done by the person is also mentioned.
('50', 4, 3, 17, 5910) If, when you do not get a cloth lined envelope, the ordinary envelope is tightly secured by a string, like a packet sent as book post, there will be no risk afterwards.
('50', 4, 3, 18, 6079) Keshu seems to have lost health again.Take immediate and effective measures to help him to recover.
('50', 4, 3, 19, 6179) Girirajs illness has lasted quite long.
('50', 4, 3, 20, 6219) His blood must be impure.
('50', 4, 3, 21, 6245) I have not received the guide to Singers.
('50', 4, 3, 22, 6287) If you find it difficult to secure a copy, give up the attempt.
('50', 4, 3, 23, 6351) I understand what you write about Hasmukhrai.
('50', 4, 3, 24, 6397) Give him the letters if and when you think you may.
('50', 4, 3, 25, 6449) Read the letter to Zaulinger before giving it to her.
('50', 4, 3, 26, 6503) Hence I dont write about her in this letter.
('50', 4, 3, 27, 6548) You must have sent an acknowledgment to Dhangopal.
('50', 4, 3, 28, 6599) How is Jamnadas?
('50', 4, 3, 29, 6616) Do the authorities let you visit him occasionally?
('50', 4, 4, 30, 6667) Tuesday morning, August 26, 1930
('50', 4, 5, 31, 6700) Non possession is allied to non stealing.
('50', 4, 5, 32, 6742) A thing not originally stolen must nevertheless be classified as stolen property if we possess it without needing it.
('50', 4, 5, 33, 6860) Possession implies provision for the future.
('50', 4, 5, 34, 6905) A seeker after truth, a follower of the law of love, cannot hold anything against tomorrow.
('50', 4, 5, 35, 6997) God never stores for the morrow; He never creates more than what is strictly needed for the moment.
('50', 4, 5, 36, 7097) If, therefore, we repose faith in His providence, we should be assured that He will give us every day our daily bread, meaning everything we require.
('50', 4, 5, 37, 7247) Saints and men of faith have always found justification for it from their experience.
('50', 4, 5, 38, 7333) Our ignorance or negligence of the Divine Law, which gives to man from day to day his daily bread and no more, has given
('50', 5, 0, 1, 7454) 6 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 5, 1, 2, 7494) rise to inequalities with all the miseries attendant upon them.
('50', 5, 1, 3, 7558) The rich have a superfluous store of things which they do not need, and which are therefore neglected and wasted; while millions starve to death for want of sustenance.
('50', 5, 1, 4, 7727) If each retained possession only of what he needed, no one would be in want and all would live in contentment.
('50', 5, 1, 5, 7838) As it is, the rich are discontented no less than the poor.
('50', 5, 1, 6, 7897) The poor man would fain become a millionaire, and the millionaire a multi millionaire.
('50', 5, 1, 7, 7984) The poor are not content if they get their daily needs.
('50', 5, 1, 8, 8040) They have a right, however, to get enough for their daily needs and it is the duty of society to help them to satisfy them.
('50', 5, 1, 9, 8164) The rich should take the initiative in dispossession with a view to universal diffusion of the spirit of contentment.
('50', 5, 1, 10, 8282) If only they keep their own property within moderate limits, the starving will be easily fed and will learn the lesson of contentment along with the rich.
('50', 5, 1, 11, 8437) Perfect fulfilment of the ideal of non possession requires that man should, like the birds, have no roof over his head, no clothing and no stock of food for the morrow.
('50', 5, 1, 12, 8606) He will indeed need his daily bread, but it will be Gods business, and not his, to provide it.
('50', 5, 1, 13, 8701) Only very very few, if any at all, can reach this ideal.
('50', 5, 1, 14, 8758) We ordinary seekers may not be repelled by the seeming impossibility.
('50', 5, 1, 15, 8828) But we must keep the ideal constantly before us, and in the light thereof critically examine our possessions and try to reduce them.
('50', 5, 1, 16, 8961) Civilization, in the real sense of the term, consists not in the multiplication, but in the deliberate and voluntary reduction of wants.
('50', 5, 1, 17, 9098) This alone promotes real happiness and contentment and increases the capacity for service.
('50', 5, 1, 18, 9189) Judging by this criterion, we find that in the Ashram we possess many things the necessity for which cannot be proved, and we thus tempt our neighbours to steal.
('50', 5, 1, 19, 9351) If people try, they can reduce their wants and, as the latter diminish, they become happier, more peaceful and healthier.
('50', 5, 1, 20, 9473) From the standpoint of pure truth, the body, too, is a possession.
('50', 5, 1, 21, 9540) It has been truly said that desire for enjoyment creates bodies for the soul and sustains them.
('50', 5, 1, 22, 9636) When this desire vanishes, there remains no further need for the body and man is free from the vicious cycle of births and deaths.
('50', 5, 1, 23, 9767) The soul is omnipresent; why should she care to be confined within the cage like body, or do evil and even kill for the sake of that cage?
('50', 5, 1, 24, 9906) We thus arrive at the ideal of total renunciation and learn the use of the body for the purposes of service so long as it exists, so much so that service, and not bread, becomes for us the staff of life.
('50', 5, 1, 25, 10110) We eat and drink, sleep and wake, for service
('50', 6, 0, 1, 10156) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 7
('50', 6, 1, 2, 10198) Such an attitude of mind brings us real happiness and the beatific vision in the fulness of time.
('50', 6, 1, 3, 10296) Let us all examine ourselves from this standpoint.
('50', 6, 1, 4, 10347) We should remember that non possession is a principle applicable to thoughts as well as to things.
('50', 6, 1, 5, 10446) A man who fills his brain with useless knowledge violates that inestimable principle.
('50', 6, 1, 6, 10532) Thoughts which turn us away from God or do not turn us towards Him are unnecessary possessions and constitute impediments in our way.
('50', 6, 1, 7, 10666) In this connection we may consider the definition of knowledge contained in Chapter XIII of the Gita.
('50', 6, 1, 8, 10768) We are there told that humility, amanitvam, etc., constitute knowledge and that all the rest is ignorance.
('50', 6, 1, 9, 10875) If this is trueand there is no doubt that it is truemuch that we hug today as knowledge is ignorance pure and simple, and therefore only does us harm instead of conferring any benefit.
('50', 6, 1, 10, 11060) It makes the mind wander and even reduces it to a vacuity, and discontent flourishes in endless ramifications of evil.
('50', 6, 1, 11, 11179) Needless to say, this is not a plea for inertia.
('50', 6, 1, 12, 11228) Every moment of our life should be filled with mental or physical activity, but that activity should be sattvik, tending towards truth.
('50', 6, 1, 13, 11364) One who has consecrated his life to service cannot be idle for a single moment.
('50', 6, 1, 14, 11444) But we have to learn to distinguish between good activity and evil activity.
('50', 6, 1, 15, 11521) This discernment goes naturally with a single minded devotion to service.
('50', 6, 1, 16, 11595) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Kakasahebs weight has again increased by one pound, and his cheerfulness has also increased.
('50', 6, 1, 17, 11714) I have regained one pound from what I had lost.
('50', 6, 1, 18, 11762) For the past three days, I have been taking boiled vegetables in addition to curds.
('50', 6, 1, 19, 11846) You will see that todays letters are put into one of the envelopes received from you, fresh slips of paper being pasted on it.
('50', 6, 1, 20, 11973) You can use the envelope again.

('50', 7, 2, 3, 12153) YERAVDA MANDIR, August 29, 1930
('50', 7, 3, 4, 12185) PREMA, I got your letter.
('50', 7, 3, 5, 12211) No one should be amused at my writing on slips of paper or be angry with me for that reason.
('50', 7, 3, 6, 12304) That is the proper thing for me to do.
('50', 7, 3, 7, 12343) Though I write on such slips, I try to make each letter as interesting as I can in the time I get.
('50', 7, 3, 8, 12442) Why are you alarmed by the suspicion that you have got some disease in your body?
('50', 7, 3, 9, 12524) What would it matter even if you had a disease and that too a grave one?
('50', 7, 3, 10, 12597) The body may live or perish, what should endure is ones devotion to God. 1 We have learnt at least this in the Ashram, if nothing more.
('50', 7, 3, 11, 12733) If you fast for a few days, the body will be cleansed.
('50', 7, 3, 12, 12788) You require Kuhne baths, hip baths and particularly friction sitz baths.
('50', 7, 3, 13, 12861) If you do not know about them, ask Kanta or Radha.
('50', 7, 3, 14, 12912) I think they know.
('50', 7, 3, 15, 12931) You may also read about them in Kuhnes book.
('50', 7, 3, 16, 12976) Whenever women suffer from any disease, it becomes necessary to know the facts about their monthly periods.
('50', 7, 3, 17, 13084) Are they normal with you?
('50', 7, 3, 18, 13110) Are they regular in appearance and duration?
('50', 7, 3, 19, 13155) Are they painful?
('50', 7, 3, 20, 13173) If necessary, consult a doctor.
('50', 7, 3, 21, 13205) I have not read Arvind Babus book.
('50', 7, 3, 22, 13240) I alone know how limited is my reading.
('50', 7, 3, 23, 13280) My main interest is in reading the book of nature.
('50', 7, 3, 24, 13331) I shall never finish reading it.

('50', 8, 3, 4, 13705) MAHALAKSHMI, Was there any letter to which I did not reply?
('50', 8, 3, 5, 13765) I do think every day about you and all other sisters.
('50', 8, 3, 6, 13819) I would have been happy, too, if you had spent a few months with me.
('50', 8, 3, 7, 13888) However, both of you have so trained yourselves, though you lived away from me, that I dont know what more you would have gained if you had stayed with me.
('50', 8, 3, 8, 14044) It is good that the children still live on fruit, etc., and that you have started on it again.

('50', 11, 3, 4, 16776) PRABHUDAS, I have your letter.
('50', 11, 3, 5, 16807) Both of us feel that you should take with you both Dhiru and Rambhau 1 if they are willing to go.
('50', 11, 3, 6, 16905) In each others company, they will stay there longer and you will have less to worry about.
('50', 11, 3, 7, 16996) With either Dhiru or Rambhau alone, you will have to go out of way to give him company.
('50', 11, 3, 8, 17084) At present, I would not like you to be in that predicament.
('50', 11, 3, 9, 17144) I had forgotten about Damodardas and therefore wrote nothing about him.
('50', 11, 3, 10, 17216) I would not have seen any harm if he had come, and you had accompanied him.
('50', 11, 3, 11, 17292) But I like the present arrangement more.
('50', 11, 3, 12, 17333) I understand what you say about the spinning wheel.
('50', 11, 3, 13, 17385) My argument was altogether different.
('50', 11, 3, 14, 17423) I appreciate that it does not bother you.
('50', 11, 3, 15, 17465) May your faith be rewarded.
('50', 11, 3, 16, 17493) You have mentioned the right shlokas.
('50', 11, 3, 17, 17531) If you have the self confidence demanded by the shloka, if you are hard working and if your idealism is based on reality, you will certainly find the rest of the means and will also acquire the required knowledge.
('50', 11, 3, 18, 17745) So, I have no objection at all if you intend to persist in your efforts.
('50', 11, 3, 19, 17818) The only condition is that you are not to do it at the cost of your health.
('50', 11, 3, 20, 17894) If your health had reached beyond recovery stage, I would not have allowed you to go to the hills.
('50', 11, 3, 21, 17993) This time you are going with the blessings of Kashi and Chhaganlal.

('50', 12, 7, 18, 19057) But when the mind itself does not want it, it would indeed be better if one works away at something with concentration.
('50', 12, 7, 19, 19177) In matters like these, children cannot be forced to do anything.
('50', 12, 7, 20, 19242) If you are feeling too lazy for udyoga 1 the feeling can by persistent effort be got out of the system.

('50', 13, 3, 7, 19756) It can easily be done in my bathroom.

('50', 14, 3, 8, 21089) But your labour has not gone in vain.
('50', 14, 3, 9, 21127) Kakasaheb was using the Gandiv.

('50', 14, 3, 12, 21263) On your wheel he has no difficulty in making one unit in two hours which is the least he has vowed to give to the charkha.
('50', 14, 3, 13, 21386) You did the right thing in transferring to the 2nd class.
('50', 14, 3, 14, 21444) There can be no harm and certainly no shame in going 2nd class, when the 3rd is clearly impossible or next to it.

('50', 16, 3, 5, 24115) However long my letter, you will think it too short.
('50', 16, 3, 6, 24168) I send between 50 and 60 letters to the Ashram every week, and I must write them during whatever time I can spare from spinning.
('50', 16, 3, 7, 24297) Hence, and also because I dont have much to write about from here every time, I write short letters in which, however, I say all that I wish to say.
('50', 16, 3, 8, 24446) If I had to write only one or two letters, I could fill them with long description of conditions here.
('50', 16, 3, 9, 24549) The letter meant for the whole Ashram is always long.
('50', 16, 3, 10, 24603) Since Mirabehn cannot read Gujarati, I write a long letter to her.
('50', 16, 3, 11, 24670) All other letters are short and to the point.
('50', 16, 3, 12, 24716) Look; I have filled half this letter explaining why I write short letters.

('50', 16, 3, 14, 24908) We pray regularlyevery day.
('50', 16, 3, 15, 24936) The Gita is also read daily.
('50', 16, 3, 16, 24965) Recently I have given up raisins and dates and, instead, eat boiled vegetables.
('50', 16, 3, 17, 25045) Generally I eat sweet potatoes and uncooked tomatoes every day or some other vegetable like cabbage.
('50', 16, 3, 18, 25146) This diet has done me no harm.
('50', 16, 3, 19, 25177) The weight has increased and constipation has been relieved.
('50', 16, 3, 20, 25238) You must have read the reports about the negotiations with the Government.
('50', 16, 3, 21, 25313) There was no truth in them at all.
('50', 16, 3, 22, 25348) Let me know your future programme, and also Jayaprakashs.
('50', 16, 3, 23, 25406) Has your mother in law recovered now?
('50', 16, 3, 24, 25444) I am sure you will nurse her with the utmost love.

('50', 17, 3, 4, 25816) DURGA, Are you cross with me?
('50', 17, 3, 5, 25846) You dont even write to me and yet will be cross.
('50', 17, 3, 6, 25895) What sort of justice is this?
('50', 17, 3, 7, 25925) Is this the way of the Ashram or that of the hills?
('50', 17, 3, 8, 25977) Or are you simply shirking letter writing by pretending to be cross?
('50', 17, 3, 9, 26046) How much do you spin daily?
('50', 17, 3, 10, 26074) What other work do you have?
('50', 17, 3, 11, 26103) Do you regularly get up in the morning?

('50', 17, 8, 17, 26301) BHAISHRI VALJI, I got your letter.
('50', 17, 8, 18, 26336) If it is only your gums which bleed, you should gargle with salt water three or four times a day and in the morning massage them with a finger using pure, finely powdered salt, taking care not to spit out the saliva meanwhile.
('50', 17, 8, 19, 26563) You may use coconut oil instead of salt.
('50', 17, 8, 20, 26604) You should also gargle with some potassium permanganate solution.
('50', 17, 8, 21, 26670) If the bleeding does not stop with this, you should consult a dentist.
('50', 17, 8, 22, 26741) Sometimes such bleeding is brought about even by indigestion.
('50', 17, 8, 23, 26803) You should eat daily a little quantity of uncooked green vegetables.
('50', 17, 8, 24, 26872) Were you forced to eat rotlas of bajra and jowar or did you eat them to keep company with the other prisoners?
('50', 17, 8, 25, 26983) I have seen you refusing to take advantage of the shade even when sitting under a green tree.
('50', 17, 8, 26, 27077) I should like to get, if available, an account of the carding and spinning done by everyone.

('50', 18, 2, 3, 27370) [September 2, 1930] 1
('50', 18, 3, 4, 27392) NARANDAS, I got the Ashram packet on Thursday.
('50', 18, 3, 5, 27439) If you get the discourses printed, send one or two copies here.
('50', 18, 3, 6, 27503) It would help if I had with me a copy of the previous discourse.
('50', 18, 3, 7, 27568) Send me also the set of Ashram rules.
('50', 18, 3, 8, 27606) If Surendra, Madhavji and Madhavlal have still not written to me, ask them to write.
('50', 18, 3, 9, 27691) Others, too, should write.
('50', 18, 3, 10, 27718) Kusums hand must be all right.
('50', 18, 3, 11, 27749) Has Mrs. Zaulinger calmed down a little?
('50', 18, 3, 12, 27790) Try to win her over.
('50', 18, 3, 13, 27811) I remember to have written to someone and given permission for a translation of the Autobiography in Swedish.
('50', 18, 3, 14, 27921) Accept the sum of 11 and credit it in whichever account you think proper.
('50', 18, 3, 15, 27995) You utilized the occasion of Rakshabandhan very well.
('50', 18, 3, 16, 28049) Take care of Lilavati.
('50', 18, 3, 17, 28072) If she gets fainting fits, she should come over to the Ashram and rest.
('50', 18, 3, 18, 28144) If you come to know Devdass weight, mention it in your letter.
('50', 18, 3, 19, 28207) In that place he should improve.
('50', 18, 3, 20, 28240) You can get a garland made from yarn spun by Jamnalalji.
('50', 18, 3, 21, 28297) The spinning wheel gives me no difficulty now.
('50', 18, 3, 22, 28344) The speed has not increased much, but it is good enough.
('50', 18, 3, 23, 28401) This is a portable spinning wheel and it required a thin mal.
('50', 18, 3, 24, 28463) If anyone knows a simple method of making a mal, he should write to me.
('50', 18, 3, 25, 28535) Abbas had explained it to me, but I have forgotten it.
('50', 18, 3, 26, 28590) One packet of cotton has been exhausted.
('50', 18, 3, 27, 28631) Together with what I can make from the second one, I shall have enough slivers to last a month.
('50', 18, 3, 28, 28727) But someone is bound to visit Kakasaheb.
('50', 18, 3, 29, 28768) Send one packet with him.
('50', 18, 3, 30, 28794) Vallabhbhai, too, has a visitor once a week or fortnight.
('50', 18, 3, 31, 28852) You may send the packet with one of the persons.
('50', 18, 3, 32, 28901) If neither course is possible, send some cotton by post as you did previously.
('50', 18, 3, 33, 28980) There is no hurry at all.
('50', 18, 3, 34, 29006) Along with it, send some pieces of leather for repairing the heels of my sandals.
('50', 18, 3, 35, 29088) If no such pieces are available and if you can find my pair of sandals, send that.
('50', 18, 3, 36, 29171) There was an extra pair during the march.
('50', 18, 3, 37, 29213) Kanti will probably know about it.
('50', 18, 3, 38, 29248) There was one in the Ashram too.
('50', 18, 3, 39, 29281) Kusum may know about it, or the person to whom she has handed over charge of these things.
('50', 18, 4, 40, 29372) 1 As in the printed source.
('50', 19, 0, 1, 29400) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 19, 1, 2, 29441) FEARLESSNESS.
('50', 19, 1, 3, 29455) As every reader of the Gita knows fearlessness heads the list of the divine attributes enumerated in Chapter XVI.
('50', 19, 1, 4, 29569) Whether this is merely due to the exigencies of metre or whether the pride of place has been deliberately yielded to fearlessness, is more than I can say.
('50', 19, 1, 5, 29724) In my opinion, however, fearlessness richly deserves the first rank assigned to it.
('50', 19, 1, 6, 29808) For it is indispensable for the growth of the other noble qualities.
('50', 19, 1, 7, 29877) How can one seek Truth or cherish love without fearlessness?
('50', 19, 1, 8, 29938) As Pritam says: The path of Hari is the path of the brave, not of cowards. Hari here means Truth.
('50', 19, 1, 9, 30036) And the brave are those armed with fearlessness, not with the sword, the rifle and the like.
('50', 19, 1, 10, 30129) These are taken up only by those who are possessed by fear.
('50', 19, 1, 11, 30189) Fearlessness connotes freedom from all external fear, fear of disease, bodily injury and death, of dispossession, of losing ones nearest and dearest, of losing reputation or giving offence, and so on.
('50', 19, 1, 12, 30390) One who overcomes the fear of death does not surmount all other fears, as is commonly but erroneously supposed.
('50', 19, 1, 13, 30502) Some of us do notfear death, but flee from the minor ills of life.
('50', 19, 1, 14, 30569) Some are ready to die themselves, but cannot bear their loved ones being taken away from them.
('50', 19, 1, 15, 30664) Some misers will put up with all this, will part even with theirlives, but not their property; others will do any number of black deeds in order to uphold their supposed prestige.
('50', 19, 1, 16, 30844) Some will swerve from the straight and narrow path which lies clear before them, simply because they are afraid of incurring the worlds odium.
('50', 19, 1, 17, 30987) The seeker after Truth must conquer all these fears.
('50', 19, 1, 18, 31040) He should be ready to sacrifice his all in the quest of Truth, even as Harishchandra did.
('50', 19, 1, 19, 31130) The story of Harishchandra may be only a parable; but every seeker will bear witness to its truth from his personal experience and, therefore, that story is as precious as any historical fact.
('50', 19, 1, 20, 31323) Perfect fearlessness is almost impossible to cultivate.
('50', 19, 1, 21, 31379) It can be attained only by him who has realized the Supreme, as it implies freedom from delusion.
('50', 19, 1, 22, 31477) One can always progress towards this goal by determined and constant endeavour and by cultivating self confidence As I have stated at the very outset, we must give up all external fears.
('50', 19, 1, 23, 31664) But the internal foes we must always fear.
('50', 19, 1, 24, 31707) We are rightly afraid of animal passion, anger and the like.
('50', 19, 1, 25, 31768) External fears cease of their own accord when once we have conquered these traitors within the camp.
('50', 19, 1, 26, 31869) All such fears revolve round the body as the centre, and will therefore disappear as soon as we get rid of attachment for the body.
('50', 19, 1, 27, 32001) We thus find that all external fear is the baseless fabric of our own
('50', 20, 0, 1, 32071) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 21
('50', 20, 1, 2, 32114) vision.
('50', 20, 1, 3, 32122) Fear has no place in our hearts when we have shaken off attachment for wealth, for family and for the body.
('50', 20, 1, 4, 32230) Enjoy the things of the earth by renouncing them 1 is the sovereign precept.
('50', 20, 1, 5, 32307) Wealth, family and the body will be there just the same; we have only to change our attitude towards them.
('50', 20, 1, 6, 32414) All these are not ours, but Gods.
('50', 20, 1, 7, 32448) Nothing whatever in this world is ours.
('50', 20, 1, 8, 32488) Even we ourselves are His.
('50', 20, 1, 9, 32515) Why then should we entertain any fear?
('50', 20, 1, 10, 32554) The Upanishad, therefore, directs us to give up attachment for things while we enjoy them.
('50', 20, 1, 11, 32645) That is to say, we must be interested in them not as proprietors but only as trustees.
('50', 20, 1, 12, 32732) He on whose behalf we hold them will give us the strength and the weapons requisite for defending them against all usurpers.
('50', 20, 1, 13, 32857) When we thus cease to be masters and reduce ourselves to the rank of servants, humbler than the very dust under our feet, all fears will roll away like mists; we shall attain ineffable peace and see Satyanarayana, the God of Truth, face to face.
('50', 20, 1, 14, 33103) Kakasaheb had not so far taken a categorical vow of spinning; he has done so now.
('50', 20, 1, 15, 33185) The vow is that he will spin for not less than two hours and not less than 160 yards daily.
('50', 20, 1, 16, 33277) He has also started carding.
('50', 20, 1, 17, 33306) He spends most of his time in physical activities.
('50', 20, 1, 18, 33357) He maintains good strength.
('50', 20, 1, 19, 33385) For the last four days or so I have given up raisins and dates and eat instead boiled vegetables, raw tomatoes, etc.
('50', 20, 1, 20, 33502) If this122 dietdoes not meet my needs, I shall add fruit.
('50', 20, 1, 21, 33560) I have made the change in order to overcome constipation.
('50', 20, 1, 22, 33618) If the change proves economical, so much the better.
('50', 20, 1, 23, 33671) I will not be obstinate about any item.

('50', 21, 3, 6, 34092) Only God is completely free from the pride of the ego.
('50', 21, 3, 7, 34147) Everyone among us, however, should strive daily to get rid of such pride.
('50', 21, 3, 8, 34221) The brave never run away from a battle; fight against lust and anger, pride and greed. Only yesterday I was trying to translate this bhajan.

('50', 21, 6, 16, 34765) We need not worry if we stumble.
('50', 21, 6, 17, 34798) Whenever we try to climb, there is always a risk of falling.
('50', 21, 6, 18, 34859) We must take that risk.
('50', 21, 6, 19, 34883) We may not knowingly take such a risk, but we should not turn back if circumstances force us to take it.
('50', 21, 6, 20, 34988) We should learn to adopt towards women the same liberal attitude that we do towards men.

('50', 22, 2, 3, 35470) September 5, 1930
('50', 22, 3, 4, 35488) DEAR FRIENDS, We have very carefully gone through the letter, written to you by H. E. the Viceroy, dated 28 8 1930. You have kindly supplemented it with a record of your conversations with the Viceroy on points not covered by the letter.
('50', 22, 3, 5, 35726) We have equally carefully gone through the Note signed by Pandit Motilal Nehru, Dr. Syed Mahmud and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, and sent by them through you.
('50', 22, 3, 6, 35881) This note embodies their considered opinion on the said letter and the conversation.
('50', 22, 3, 7, 35966) We gave two anxious nights to these papers and we had the benefit of a full and free discussion with you on all the points arising out of these papers.
('50', 22, 3, 8, 36118) And as we have told you, we have all arrived at the definite conclusion that we see no meeting ground between the Government and the Indian National Congress so far as we can speak for the latter, being out of touch with the outside world.
('50', 22, 3, 9, 36358) We unreservedly associate ourselves with the opinion contained in the Note sent by the distinguished prisoners in the Naini Central Prison, but these friends expect us to give in our own words our view of the position finally reached in the negotiations for peace, which you, with patriotic motives, have carried on during the past two months at considerable sacrifice of your own time and no less inconvenience to yourselves.
('50', 22, 3, 10, 36785) We shall therefore allude as briefly as possible to the fundamental difficulties that have stood in the way of peace being achieved.
('50', 22, 4, 11, 36918) 1 After meeting Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and M. R. Jayakar the Viceroy addressed a letter to Sapru on August 28, vide Appendix Viceroys letter to Sir T.B. Sapru, 28 8 1930. Sapru and Jayakar then met Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr. Syed Mahmud at Naini Jail on August 30 and 31 and showed them the Viceroys letter as also notes of conversation with him, vide Appendix Notes of Conversations with Viceroys, 5 9 1930. The Nehrus then gave them their final note addressed to Gandhiji, vide Appendix Note From Nehrus, 31 8 1930..
('50', 22, 4, 12, 37449) With these documents Sapru and Jayakar saw Gandhiji and other leaders at Yeravda Jail on September 3, 4 and 5. A draft of this Statement available in Gandhijis hand in S.N. 1927 bears some changes and additions in a handwriting other than Gandhijis.
('50', 23, 0, 1, 37699) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 23, 1, 2, 37740) The Viceroys letter, dated July 16, 1930, is, we have taken, intended to satisfy, so far as may be, the terms of the interview Pandit Motilal Nehru gave to Mr. George Slocombe on June 20th, and the statement submitted by Mr. Slocombe to him on June 25, and approved by him.
('50', 23, 1, 3, 38014) We are unable to read in the Viceroys language in his letter of July 16 anything like satisfaction of the terms of the interview or the said statement.
('50', 23, 1, 4, 38166) Here are the relevant parts of the interview and the statement.
('50', 23, 2, 5, 38230) In the interview it was stated: If the terms of the Round Table Conference are to be left open and we are expected to go to London to argue the case for Dominion Status, I should decline.
('50', 23, 2, 6, 38418) If it was made clear, however, that the Conference would meet to frame a constitution for a Free India subject to such adjustments of our mutual relations as are required by the special needs and conditions of India and our past association, I for one would be disposed to recommend to the Congress to accept the invitation to participate in the Conference.
('50', 23, 2, 7, 38776) We must be masters in our household, but we are ready to agree to reasonable terms for the period of transfer of power from a British administration in India to a responsible Indian Government.
('50', 23, 2, 8, 38970) The Conference must be to meet British people to discuss these terms as nation to nation and on an equal footing. 1
('50', 23, 3, 9, 39086) The statement contained the following:
('50', 23, 4, 10, 39125) The Government would give private assurance that they would support the demand for full responsible Government for India subject to such mutual adjustments and terms of transfer as are required by the special needs and conditions of India and by her long association with Great Britain and as may be decided by the Round Table Conference. 2
('50', 23, 5, 11, 39466) Here is the relevant part of the Viceroys letter:
('50', 23, 6, 12, 39516) It remains my earnest desire, as it is that of my Governmentand I have no doubt also that of His Majestys Governmentto do everything we can in our respective spheres to assist the people of India to obtain as large a degree of management of their own affairs as can be shown to be consistent with making provision for those matters in regard to which they are not at present in a position to assume responsibility.
('50', 23, 6, 13, 39931) What those matters may be, and what provisions may best be made for them, will engage the attention of the Conference, but I have never believed that, with

('50', 24, 1, 2, 40214) mutual confidence, on both sides, it should be impossible to reach an agreement.
('50', 24, 2, 3, 40295) We feel that there is a vast difference between the two positions.
('50', 24, 2, 4, 40362) Where Pandit Motilalji visualizes a Free India enjoying a status different in kind from the present as a result of the deliberations of the proposed Round Table Conference, the Viceroys letter merely 2
('50', 24, 3, 5, 40564) commits him and his Government and the British Cabinet to an earnest desire 3 to assist the people of 4 India to obtain 5 as large a degree of the management of their 6 own affairs as can be shown 7 to be consistent with making provision for those matters in regard to which they are not at present in a position to assume responsibility.
('50', 24, 3, 6, 40903) In other words, the prospect held out by the Viceroys letter is one of getting, at the most, something more along the lines of reforms commencing with those known to us as the Lansdowne Reforms.
('50', 24, 3, 7, 41098) As we had the fear that our interpretation was correct in our letter of 15 8 1930 signed also by Pandit Motilal Nehru, Dr. Syed Mahmud and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, we put our position negatively and said what would not in our opinion satisfy the Congress.
('50', 24, 3, 8, 41354) The letter you have now brought from H.E. the Viceroy reiterates the original position taken up by him in his first letter, and, we are grieved to say, contemptuously dismisses our letter as unworthy of consider ation and regards discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in the letter as impossible.
('50', 24, 3, 9, 41664) You have thrown further light on the question by telling us that if Mr. Gandhi definitely faced the Government of India with such a question, i.e., the right of secession from the Empire at Indias will, the Viceroy would say, that they were not prepared to treat it as an open question.
('50', 24, 3, 10, 41951) We, on the other hand regard the question as the central point in any constitution that India is to secure and one which ought not to need any argument.

('50', 25, 1, 2, 42597) Responsible Government or full Self Government or whatever other term it is to be known by, it can be only on an absolutely voluntary basis, leaving each party to sever the partnership or association at will.
('50', 25, 1, 3, 42806) If India is to remain no longer a part of the Empire but is to become an equal and free partner in the Commonwealth, she must feel the want and warmth of that association and never otherwise.
('50', 25, 1, 4, 42998) You will please observe this position is clearly brought out in the interview already alluded to by us.
('50', 25, 1, 5, 43102) So long, therefore, as the British Government or the British people regard this position as impossible or untenable, the Congress must, in our opinion, continue the fight for freedom.
('50', 25, 1, 6, 43286) The attitude taken up by the Viceroy over the very mild proposal made by us regarding the salt tax affords a further painful insight into the Governments mentality.
('50', 25, 1, 7, 43451) It is as plain as daylight to us that, from the dizzy heights of Simla, the rulers of India are unable to understand or appreciate the difficulties of the starving millions living in the plains whose incessant toil makes 1 Government from such a giddy height at all possible.
('50', 25, 1, 8, 43727) If the blood of innocent people spilt during the past five months to sustain the monopoly of a gift of nature 2 next in importance to poor people only to air and water has not brought home to the Government the conviction of its utter immorality, no Conference of Indian leaders as suggested by the Viceroy can possibly do so.
('50', 25, 1, 9, 44054) The suggestion that those who ask for the repeal of the monopoly should show a source of equivalent revenue adds insult to injury.
('50', 25, 1, 10, 44185) This attitude is an indication that if Government can help it the existing crushingly expensive system shall continue to the end of time.
('50', 25, 1, 11, 44323) We venture further to point out that not only does the Government here, but Governments all the world over, openly condone breaches of measures which have become unpopular but which for technical or other reasons cannot straightway be repealed.
('50', 25, 1, 12, 44568) We need not now deal with many other important matters in which too there is no adequate 3 advance from the Viceroy to the popular position set forth by us.
('50', 25, 1, 13, 44725) We hope we have brought out sufficient weighty matters in which there appears at present to be an unbridgeable gulf between the British Government and the Congress.

('50', 26, 1, 2, 45099) There need, however, be no disappointment for the apparent failure of the peace negotiations.
('50', 26, 1, 3, 45193) The Congress is engaged in a grim struggle for freedom.
('50', 26, 1, 4, 45249) The nation has resorted to a weapon which the rulers being unused to it will take time to understand and appreciate.
('50', 26, 1, 5, 45366) We are not surprised that a few months suffering has not converted them 1. The Congress desires to harm no 2 single legitimate interest by whomsoever acquired.
('50', 26, 1, 6, 45526) It has no quarrel with Englishmen as such, but it resents and will resent with all the moral strength at its command the intolerable British domination.
('50', 26, 1, 7, 45679) Non violence being assured to the end, we are certain of the early fulfilment of the national aspiration.
('50', 26, 1, 8, 45785) This we say in spite of the bitter and often insulting language used by the powers that be in regard to Civil Disobedience.
('50', 26, 1, 9, 45909) Lastly, we once more thank you for the great pains you have taken to bring about peace, but we suggest that the time has not arri ved when any further peace negotiations should be carried on with those in charge of the Congress organization.
('50', 26, 1, 10, 46151) As prisoners, we labour under an obvious 3 handicap.
('50', 26, 1, 11, 46204) Our opinion is based, as it must be, on second hand evidence and runs the risk of being faulty.
('50', 26, 1, 12, 46300) 4 It would be naturally open to those in charge of the Congress organization to see any of us.

('50', 27, 4, 7, 47071) We shall however now win her over by kindness, if we can.
('50', 27, 4, 8, 47129) Your dharma is clear.
('50', 27, 4, 9, 47151) At least for the present you should leave her company altogether.
('50', 27, 4, 10, 47217) You should neither serve her nor accept service from her.
('50', 27, 4, 11, 47275) I have written a letter to her which Narandas will read to her.
('50', 27, 4, 12, 47339) You should read it.
('50', 27, 4, 13, 47359) A man or a woman susceptible to mutual passion has no right to accept help from or offer it to each other.
('50', 27, 4, 14, 47466) You have ceased to be man and wife, but even when the relationship exists the husband who is susceptible to carnal desire can never render pure service to his wife.
('50', 27, 4, 15, 47631) Know this to have been proved by experience.
('50', 27, 4, 16, 47676) Therefore, forget, at any rate for some time, that a person named .
('50', 27, 4, 17, 47744) behn lives in the Ashram.
('50', 27, 4, 18, 47770) That alone will do you good.
('50', 27, 4, 19, 47799) behn finds this an impossible situation she will go.

('50', 27, 8, 27, 48135) We should certainly feel ashamed if we fall ill.
('50', 27, 8, 28, 48184) But very often illness comes to us without our knowing how it comes.

('50', 28, 6, 16, 49133) It is true that I do not write to you every week.
('50', 28, 6, 17, 49183) I realize that what I have been writing about non stealing and the other vows is rather complicated and it does not interest you.
('50', 28, 6, 18, 49313) It is not the language that is difficult, but the ideas are difficult to grasp and they are stated tersely.
('50', 28, 6, 19, 49421) That is the way of explaining a lot in a few words.
('50', 28, 6, 20, 49473) Now, if you understood those things from Chimanlal or Premabehn and read them again, you would get interested.

('50', 29, 6, 21, 50725) But you can do this only with Khurshedbehns permission.
('50', 29, 6, 22, 50781) You should write pure truth in your diary.
('50', 29, 6, 23, 50824) Dont mind who reads it.
('50', 29, 6, 24, 50848) It is to our good to appear to the world exactly as we are.

('50', 30, 2, 3, 51124) September 6, 1930
('50', 30, 3, 4, 51142) BHAI BECHARDAS, I have your letter.
('50', 30, 3, 5, 51178) Really speaking Kakasaheb should reply to it.
('50', 30, 3, 6, 51224) But just now I reply as he can write only a limited number of letters.
('50', 30, 3, 7, 51295) Take it that the view expressed here is that of us both.
('50', 30, 3, 8, 51352) I will say nothing about the method of giving the etymology 1. If Kakasaheb wishes, he will write about it later.
('50', 30, 3, 9, 51466) After discussing the matter with him, I understand that your main work is to translate the Agamas 2. Shri Punjabhai has given the money for that work, and it is our duty, therefore, to carry out the object of the grant as quickly as possible.
('50', 30, 3, 10, 51709) You should not mind it if in devoting your time to that work you have to postpone or delay work on etymology; or you may get it done through somebody else if that can be conveniently arranged.
('50', 30, 3, 11, 51902) The idea in placing Bhakti Prasad at your disposal was not that he might do original work on his own, but that he might work under you and help you, and might, if he was persevering, acquire proficiency in the work.
('50', 30, 3, 12, 52118) As for your eyes I think you should lay down a limit.
('50', 30, 3, 13, 52172) You should be satisfied with whatever help is available in Gujarat.
('50', 30, 3, 14, 52240) Dr. Haribhai is a specialist in eye diseases.
('50', 30, 3, 15, 52286) If he cannot help you, you should assume that nobody else will be able to and rest content.
('50', 30, 3, 16, 52378) There should be a self imposed limit like this for anyone who has decided to live a simple life.
('50', 30, 3, 17, 52475) Do the countless poor have the benefit of help even from a Dr. Haribhai?
('50', 30, 3, 18, 52548) This of course is my personal view.
('50', 30, 3, 19, 52584) I can say that Kakasaheb now agrees with this view.
('50', 30, 3, 20, 52636) But this is a delicate matter.
('50', 30, 3, 21, 52667) Everyone should lay down the limit for himself according to his own lights and his own wish.
('50', 30, 3, 22, 52760) The limits accepted by one person cannot, in such a matter, apply to all.
('50', 30, 3, 23, 52834) BAPU [PS.] My reason for using now and saying that Kakasaheb now agrees is that, as he tells me, he himself had formerly advised you to consult one or two other doctors.

('50', 31, 8, 35, 54532) I have made no hard and fast rule about the avoidance of fruit.
('50', 31, 8, 36, 54596) But just now it is no deprivation whatsoever and possibly a gain in health.

('50', 32, 1, 2, 54715) My mastery over the wheel is increasing.
('50', 32, 1, 3, 54756) The fatigue is no longer felt.
('50', 32, 1, 4, 54787) I see that if you concentrate on the puni end whilst the thread is drawing, then on the point of the spindle when the thread is being shifted to the cone and then on the cone when it is brought there, you avoid breakage if the puni is sound.
('50', 32, 1, 5, 55029) I hope shortly to increase the speed appreciably.
('50', 32, 1, 6, 55079) It is better even now.
('50', 32, 1, 7, 55102) But there is much room for improvement.
('50', 32, 1, 8, 55142) Anyway, just now it is the wheel that absorbs my attention to the exclusion of other studies.
('50', 32, 1, 9, 55236) Kaka is still at your wheel.
('50', 32, 1, 10, 55265) He is getting on slowly.
('50', 32, 1, 11, 55290) The carding bow is quite all right.
('50', 32, 1, 12, 55326) I have no difficulty in adjusting it.
('50', 32, 1, 13, 55364) Ever since it has been with me the gut broke only once and that too after Kaka too began to work on it.
('50', 32, 1, 14, 55468) He is absolutely new to it but is an extremely careful worker.
('50', 32, 1, 15, 55531) Then too I deliberately cut it where I saw it had worn out.
('50', 32, 1, 16, 55591) Kaka had devised a new catch for holding the spindle whilst unwinding.
('50', 32, 1, 17, 55662) It is fixed to the box.
('50', 32, 1, 18, 55686) The spindle is mounted on it and the thread is held between the left hand fingers.
('50', 32, 1, 19, 55769) The result is that it winds tightly on the winder.
('50', 32, 1, 20, 55820) There is saving in time too.
('50', 32, 1, 21, 55849) On your wheel of course the spindle remains on the holders whilst the unwinding is done.
('50', 32, 1, 22, 55938) The catch was wanted for the box.
('50', 32, 1, 23, 55972) I hope you have had some rest somewhere.
('50', 32, 1, 24, 56013) Do not rush.

('50', 32, 7, 29, 56168) I have your letter.
('50', 32, 7, 30, 56188) Once again Father and Jairamdas were with me for a couple of days.
('50', 32, 7, 31, 56255) Your letter to me was received at the same time and was read by Father.
('50', 32, 7, 32, 56327) He also gave me your letter to him to read.
('50', 32, 7, 33, 56371) Your sketch of Mother is moving.
('50', 32, 7, 34, 56404) Such indeed were most mothers of old; hence I found nothing unusual in your description.

('50', 33, 6, 10, 56858) SUSHILA, I have a letter from you after a long time.
('50', 33, 6, 11, 56911) But you blame me, like a thief turning round on the policeman.
('50', 33, 6, 12, 56974) You must have got my previous letter.
('50', 33, 6, 13, 57012) Sitas illness has lasted too long.
('50', 33, 6, 14, 57047) Are you not able to discover the cause?
('50', 33, 6, 15, 57087) As I have not seen her myself, I do not have the courage to say anything in the matter.
('50', 33, 6, 16, 57175) But I make this suggestion.
('50', 33, 6, 17, 57203) It would be advisable to keep her chiefly on milk, curds and fruit instead of giving her a variety of things to eat.
('50', 33, 6, 18, 57320) If she is given toast, it should be of brown bread.
('50', 33, 6, 19, 57372) I see no need to give her porridge.
('50', 33, 6, 20, 57408) If you wish, you may give her cod liver oil.
('50', 33, 6, 21, 57453) I myself would never think of giving it to anyone.
('50', 33, 6, 22, 57504) But you should attach no importance to this view.
('50', 33, 6, 23, 57554) How is your ear?
('50', 33, 6, 24, 57571) Write to me every week.

('50', 34, 5, 10, 58342) Into which language is Father translating the Sirat?
('50', 34, 5, 11, 58395) During my first imprisonment, I had read that book and Asva e Sahaba and found them extremely interesting.
('50', 34, 5, 12, 58502) But now my Urdu has become rusty, and in any case this time spinning leaves me no time to read.

('50', 36, 3, 6, 60917) 1 We both find your translation inaccurate at places.
('50', 36, 3, 7, 60971) It is certainly hasty.

('50', 37, 7, 15, 62454) The personality perishes, must perish.

('50', 37, 7, 18, 62641) It is because the ocean has no existence, if the drop has not, i.e., has no individuality.

('50', 39, 7, 13, 64704) In regard to degrees, after discussing the matter Kakasaheb and I have both come to the conclusion that there should not be more than three stages and that for each stage the name of the diploma or the degree should be the same for all subjects, whether craft or industry or art or letters or philosophy.
('50', 39, 7, 14, 65009) At present there are three diplomas or degrees, Vineet, Visharad and Pundit, in the Vidyapith.
('50', 39, 7, 15, 65104) Vineet (Matriculation, Entrance) is one who has acquired general knowledge in a subject.

('50', 40, 1, 2, 65872) 58. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('50', 40, 2, 3, 65902) September 5/9, 1930
('50', 40, 3, 4, 65922) NARANDAS, I again got the packet of letters on Wednesday.
('50', 40, 3, 5, 65980) Read the letters to Manibehn and Bhagwanji.
('50', 40, 3, 6, 66024) Read out yourself to Manibehn the letter meant for her.
('50', 40, 3, 7, 66080) If you read both the letters, everything will be clear to you.
('50', 40, 3, 8, 66143) I need not, therefore, give you any other instructions.
('50', 40, 3, 9, 66199) I had not thought that you would have to attend to such duties too, but I should have known.
('50', 40, 3, 10, 66292) It is Gods kindness that you are capable of attending to them.
('50', 40, 3, 11, 66355) The problem of Keshu seems to be difficult.
('50', 40, 3, 12, 66399) Be careful and carry on as well as you may.
('50', 40, 3, 13, 66443) What made him break with Navin?
('50', 40, 3, 14, 66475) The two used to get on very well with each other.
('50', 40, 3, 15, 66525) You may send me letters received from abroad, if there are any which you think should be sent to me.
('50', 40, 3, 16, 66626) If a letter is very important, make a copy and send me the letter or the copy.
('50', 40, 3, 17, 66705) If Dudabhai is eager to have Lakshmi with him and if the latter wishes to go, do not stop her.
('50', 40, 3, 18, 66800) She is sufficiently obstinate, but watch if you have a different experience of her now.
('50', 40, 4, 19, 66888) September 8, 1930
('50', 40, 5, 20, 66906) There is barely sufficient cotton for carding to last me up to the 20th.
('50', 40, 5, 21, 66979) If you have not sent any so far, send some immediately.
('50', 40, 5, 22, 67035) It will be all right if you send 4 Ib.
('50', 40, 5, 23, 67074) Since slivers have to be made for both of us, a good deal of cotton is consumed.
('50', 40, 5, 24, 67155) Kakasaheb has started only recently.
('50', 40, 5, 25, 67192) He is likely to spin more as time passes.
('50', 40, 5, 26, 67234) I have already written to you about the sandals.
('50', 40, 5, 27, 67283) Read about our weight and the changes in my diet, etc., in the letter to Mirabehn.
('50', 40, 5, 28, 67366) Tuesday morning, September 9, 1930
('50', 40, 6, 29, 67401) REMOVAL OF UNTOUCHABILITY
('50', 40, 7, 30, 67427) This, too, is a new observance, like control of the palate, and may even appear a little strange.
('50', 40, 7, 31, 67525) But it is of vital importance.
('50', 40, 7, 32, 67556) Untouchability means pollution by the touch of certain persons by reason of their birth in a particular caste or family.
('50', 40, 7, 33, 67677) In the words of Akha, it is an excrescence.
('50', 40, 7, 34, 67721) In the guise of religion, it is always in the way and corrupts religion.
('50', 40, 7, 35, 67794) None can be born untouchable as all are sparks of one and the same Fire.
('50', 40, 7, 36, 67867) It is wrong to treat certain human beings as untouchables from birth.
('50', 40, 7, 37, 67937) It is also wrong to entertain false
('50', 41, 0, 1, 67973) 42 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 41, 1, 2, 68014) scruples about touching a dead body, which should be an object of compassion and respect.
('50', 41, 1, 3, 68104) It is only out of considerations of health that we bathe after touching a dead body or after an application of oil, or after a shave.
('50', 41, 1, 4, 68238) A man who does not bathe in such cases may be looked upon as dirty, but surely not as a sinner.
('50', 41, 1, 5, 68334) A mother may be untouchable so long as she has not bathed or washed her hands and feet after cleaning up her childs dirt, but if a child happened to touch her, it would not be polluted by the touch.
('50', 41, 1, 6, 68533) But Bhangis, Dheds, Chamars and the like are contemptuously looked down upon as untouchables from birth.
('50', 41, 1, 7, 68638) They may bathe for years with any amount of soap, dress well and wear the marks of Vaishnavas, read the Gita every day and follow a learned profession, and yet they remainun touchables!
('50', 41, 1, 8, 68824) This is rank irreligion fit only to be destroyed.
('50', 41, 1, 9, 68874) By treating removal of untouchability as an Ashram observance, we assert our belief that untouchability is not only not a part and parcel of Hinduism, but that it is a plague, which it is the bounden duty of every Hindu to combat.
('50', 41, 1, 10, 69105) Every Hindu, therefore, who considers it a sin should atone for it by fraternizing with untouchables, associating with them in a spirit of love and service, deeming himself purified by such acts, redressing their grievances, helping them patiently to overcome ignorance and other evils due to the slavery of ages, and inspiring other Hindus to do likewise.
('50', 41, 1, 11, 69462) When one visualizes the removal of untouchability from this spiritual standpoint, its material and political results sink into insignificance and we befriend the so called untouchables regardless of such results.
('50', 41, 1, 12, 69675) Seekers after Truth will never waste a thought on the material consequences of their quest, which is not a matter of policy with them, but something interwoven with the very texture of their lives.
('50', 41, 1, 13, 69873) Similar is the case of those who have vowed to remove untouchability.
('50', 41, 1, 14, 69943) When we have realized the supreme importance of this observance, we shall discover that the evil it seeks to combat is not restricted in its operation to the suppressed classes.
('50', 41, 1, 15, 70121) Evil, no bigger than a mustard seed in the first instance, soon assumes gigantic proportions and in the long run destroys that upon which it settles.
('50', 41, 1, 16, 70271) Thus this evil has now assailed all departments of life.
('50', 41, 1, 17, 70328) We practise untouchability against followers of other religions than our own, against those who belong to other sects than our own within the Hindu fold and even against members of our own sect, so much so that, ever busy observing untouchability, we .become a burden on the earth.
('50', 41, 1, 18, 70610) We have hardly enough time even to look after ourselves,.
('50', 41, 1, 19, 70668) thanks to the never ending ablutions and exclusive preparation of food necessitated by false notions of untouchability.
('50', 41, 1, 20, 70788) While pretending to pray to God, we offer worship not to God but to ourselves.
('50', 41, 1, 21, 70867) This observance, therefore, is not fulfilled merely by our making friends
('50', 42, 0, 1, 70941) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 43
('50', 42, 1, 2, 70984) with untouchables but by loving all life as our own selves.
('50', 42, 1, 3, 71044) Removal of untouchability means love for and service of the whole world and thus merges into ahimsa.
('50', 42, 1, 4, 71145) Removal of untouchability spells the breaking down of barriers between man and man, and between the various orders of beings.
('50', 42, 1, 5, 71271) We find such barriers erected everywhere in the world; but here we have been mainly concerned with the untouchability which has received religious sanction in India and reduced lakhs and crores of human beings to a state bordering on slavery.

('50', 42, 5, 19, 72203) As your work increases, your handwriting improves.
('50', 42, 5, 20, 72254) You should improve it still further.
('50', 42, 5, 21, 72291) You should not try to give a flourish to the characters.
('50', 42, 5, 22, 72348) For instance, the sign for the sound u should be written thus  and not thus ~.
('50', 42, 5, 23, 72427) If you form the habit of writing each letter of the alphabet as it is printed, your handwriting will appear very beautiful.
('50', 42, 5, 24, 72551) I wish to see you and all other women perfect in every respect.

('50', 43, 7, 15, 73406) There is no difference even in the handwriting of you two.
('50', 43, 7, 16, 73465) This is good.
('50', 43, 7, 17, 73479) But, then, does not this increase your responsibility?
('50', 43, 7, 18, 73534) You should, therefore, go on rising higher in all respects.
('50', 43, 7, 19, 73594) God has given you the strength to do so.
('50', 43, 7, 20, 73635) He has now provided even the circumstances in which you can rise as high as you wish to.
('50', 43, 7, 21, 73724) Go forward that is my prayer and my blessing.

('50', 44, 3, 6, 74181) It is but natural that Kanjibhais daughter should be so brave.
('50', 44, 3, 7, 74244) On reading about your courage, I was reminded of a parable in one of the Upanishads.
('50', 44, 3, 8, 74329) It compares our senses to horses.
('50', 44, 3, 9, 74363) The human soul is described as the charioteer and that which can control these horses, the senses, is described as a conqueror.
('50', 44, 3, 10, 74491) That [soul] which lets itself be carried away by the horses is said to be defeated by them.
('50', 44, 3, 11, 74583) As you could stop that horse by the power of your courage, so you and other young women there ought to ride the senses and control them.
('50', 44, 3, 12, 74720) If you succeed in doing so we shall live in Ramarajya, no matter what the outward circumstances are.
('50', 44, 3, 13, 74821) Show this to Hamidabehn and explain the idea to her.
('50', 44, 3, 14, 74874) May God grant you still greater strength and courage.

('50', 44, 7, 24, 75271) If you have as much sleep as you need, you will feel fresher and be able to do the same amount of work in less time.
('50', 44, 7, 25, 75388) Irrespective of whether this happens, you should let your mind rest between 9 and 4 and lie down to sleep.
('50', 44, 7, 26, 75495) Start doing this immediately.
('50', 44, 7, 27, 75525) I should be happy if you wouldnt argue about this.

('50', 45, 6, 11, 76258) You need not get frightened by the bone growth.
('50', 45, 6, 12, 76306) You should take sun bath only in the early morning at the time of sunrise.
('50', 45, 6, 13, 76381) At least that part of the body where there is bone growth should be exposed to the suns rays.

('50', 47, 3, 7, 78791) If you are not doing so, start writing to them.
('50', 47, 3, 8, 78839) Remember that you are in the position of a mother to many of them.
('50', 47, 3, 9, 78906) You have no dearth of sons and daughters.
('50', 47, 3, 10, 78948) We know that all those daughters are doing work which involves danger to their persons.
('50', 47, 3, 11, 79036) It is but our duty to undertake such work.
('50', 47, 3, 12, 79079) We may not seek it, but when it comes to us unsought, we should welcome it and pray for Gods help to succeed in it.
('50', 47, 3, 13, 79195) Those women alone who, though outside the Ashram, observe the vows will be said to have succeeded in the struggle.

('50', 47, 7, 19, 79501) MANU (TRIVEDI), I got your letter.
('50', 47, 7, 20, 79536) Both of us were relieved.
('50', 47, 7, 21, 79562) We should be happy, rather than feel sorry, that others of our age do better work than we.
('50', 47, 7, 22, 79653) What God, World Teacher and Master, has willed for the day, it is futile to grieve over. We can work only as much as the body which has been given us permits us to do.
('50', 47, 7, 23, 79821) He who shirks work and does less than what he is capable of has cause to feel ashamed.
('50', 47, 7, 24, 79908) A person like you has no such cause at all.

('50', 49, 3, 7, 81410) Afterwards, I got a letter from Chhaganlal [Joshi] giving me news about his bad health.

('50', 49, 3, 13, 81667) Isnt that so?
('50', 49, 3, 14, 81681) Have no hesitation in telling me about anything you fail to do through lethargy or any other cause.
('50', 49, 3, 15, 81781) Even your writing to me will protect you, for the very thought that you will have to tell me will prompt you to be regular.
('50', 49, 3, 16, 81905) What can I do about Ba from here?
('50', 49, 3, 17, 81939) You yourself should complain to Mithubehn.
('50', 49, 3, 18, 81982) She certainly cannot act independently.
('50', 49, 3, 19, 82022) She has gone there to work under the leadership of Mithubehn and ought to submit to it.

('50', 50, 8, 25, 83566) Our being able to write to each other is quite an uncertain matter.
('50', 50, 8, 26, 83634) Nobody knows when we may have to stop.
('50', 50, 8, 27, 83673) There are no such signs just now, but after all a prison is a prison.

('50', 51, 3, 7, 84143) I hope Jayaprakash has recovered now.
('50', 51, 3, 8, 84181) How is it you dont get any newspapers there?
('50', 51, 3, 9, 84226) They get a good many in the Ashram, and can send you some.

('50', 51, 3, 18, 84579) Will he be able to earn anything?
('50', 51, 3, 19, 84613) Does he worry about anything?
('50', 51, 3, 20, 84643) Even if you write directly to me, most probably I shall get your letters.

('50', 51, 8, 28, 84985) But can love be expressed through words?
('50', 51, 8, 29, 85026) Love is related to the heart and can be recognized through the heart.
('50', 51, 8, 30, 85096) When words come from the heart, they do have some meaning.
('50', 51, 8, 31, 85155) Taras 1 is a sad story.
('50', 51, 8, 32, 85179) If Tara is firm, if she has humility, courage and tolerance, she can leave the house of her in laws and live with you in the Ashram.
('50', 51, 8, 33, 85312) You alone can know if you can give her refuge.

('50', 52, 1, 4, 85540) For this result, there should be sincere love even for the oppressor.

('50', 52, 7, 18, 86104) It is remarkable how well you have kept on the whole in the midst of the tremendous rush.
('50', 52, 7, 19, 86194) It is a sign of mental calm I expect.
('50', 52, 7, 20, 86232) Keshu did offer to send me a bamboo charkha.
('50', 52, 7, 21, 86277) I would not let him.
('50', 52, 7, 22, 86298) The fault was mine in that I did not master the detailed working of it when there was ample opportunity for so doing.
('50', 52, 7, 23, 86416) I am now doing penance by mastering it by making mistakes.
('50', 52, 7, 24, 86475) I see that the mal and its proper adjustment have much to do both with speed and efficient working.
('50', 52, 7, 25, 86575) I am getting on.
('50', 52, 7, 26, 86592) I am by no means despondent.
('50', 52, 7, 27, 86621) The extraordinary fatigue is gone.
('50', 52, 7, 28, 86656) There need be no anxiety therefore about the wheel.
('50', 52, 7, 29, 86708) Kaka is at your wheel.
('50', 52, 7, 30, 86731) He cant yet get more than 80 rounds per hour.
('50', 52, 7, 31, 86777) I am sorry about Mrs. Ashers miscarriage.
('50', 52, 7, 32, 86819) The chief thing they should do is to impose restraint upon their carnal desires for at least three years if they expect a full grown healthy baby and Mrs. Asher is to become a strong and healthy mother.
('50', 52, 7, 33, 87022) To this end they should live
('50', 53, 0, 1, 87051) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 53, 1, 2, 87092) separately if need be.
('50', 53, 1, 3, 87115) Of course this restraint is in addition to simple diet, open air life and plenty of gentle exercise.
('50', 53, 1, 4, 87216) It would do her a world of good if she would take Kuhne baths both hip and sitz I am sure that if she follows the course for three years and has patience she will be a new woman.
('50', 53, 1, 5, 87395) You may pass this on to Mrs. Asher if you like.
('50', 53, 1, 6, 87443) My walks must still be confined.
('50', 53, 1, 7, 87476) But I am keeping quite well.
('50', 53, 1, 8, 87505) The wheel and thinking about it make the time fly.
('50', 53, 1, 9, 87556) And at the end of the day I get good sleep which to me means more than food.
('50', 53, 1, 10, 87633) I have finished translating the 65th bhajan.
('50', 53, 1, 11, 87678) But there is yet a long distance to cover.
('50', 53, 1, 12, 87721) I rarely get time to do more than one and I have not yet failed to do one per day.
('50', 53, 1, 13, 87804) Though therefore the progress is steady, it is undoubtedly slow.

('50', 54, 8, 17, 89114) I smell mental violence even from here.
('50', 54, 8, 18, 89154) People have not much appreciated non violence as a religious principle, but even the fact that they have adopted it as a policy is evidence of a great change.
('50', 54, 8, 19, 89313) From this they will one day appreciate it as a religious principle.
('50', 54, 8, 20, 89381) If we could make ourselves living embodiments of non violence, we would, when the atmosphere was unfavourable to it, be twice as vigilant and do twice as much tapashcharya as when the atmosphere might be favourable.
('50', 54, 8, 21, 89597) We dont pay much attention to the danger concerning women which you mention, since we always condone mens misdeeds.
('50', 54, 8, 22, 89713) It is good indeed that women have come out.
('50', 54, 8, 23, 89757) About those who come out successful from the test, we will say that they have really observed the Ashram vows and have understood the meaning of dharma.
('50', 54, 8, 24, 89910) If any woman falls despite her striving, she will strive again and rise.
('50', 54, 8, 25, 89983) If a woman had been secretly nursing gross desires and, having an opportunity now, gratifies them, we should know that she did not

('50', 55, 1, 3, 90350) We should welcome that too.
('50', 55, 1, 4, 90378) Have no fear, therefore, and dont worry on their account.
('50', 55, 1, 5, 90436) Let each of us take care of himself or herself.
('50', 55, 1, 6, 90484) It is for God to look after all.
('50', 55, 1, 7, 90517) If even a few of us remain pure, they will save those who stray from the path.
('50', 55, 1, 8, 90596) Personally I am confident that a good many of us will remain pure.
('50', 55, 1, 9, 90663) I dont like the present state of affairs in which the two classes have become a mixed crowd.
('50', 55, 1, 10, 90756) But it is inevitable.

('50', 55, 4, 15, 90991) 83. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('50', 55, 5, 16, 91021) YERAVDA MANDIR, September 14/16, 1930
('50', 55, 6, 17, 91059) NARANDAS, I got your letter.
('50', 55, 6, 18, 91088) I follow your hint concerning the women.
('50', 55, 6, 19, 91129) Read my letter to Chhaganlal Joshi.
('50', 55, 6, 20, 91165) You or Gangabehn should keep in correspondence with the women who have settled down for work in different places outside the Ashram.
('50', 55, 6, 21, 91298) If it seems necessary and if she can find time, Gangabehn should even pay visits to some of those places.
('50', 55, 6, 22, 91404) Lapses will occur in some of them, but we need not be afraid about them.
('50', 55, 6, 23, 91477) We should remain, and see that others, too, remain, sufficiently vigilant and leave the result to God.
('50', 55, 6, 24, 91580) What indeed is our tapashcharya in comparison to the degree of self control we expect from and wish to see in others?
('50', 55, 6, 25, 91698) Whatever that is, we wish to follow no other path.
('50', 55, 6, 26, 91749) We wish to uphold the fullest freedom for women.
('50', 55, 6, 27, 91798) It does not matter if we miss the path on our way, if we stumble, are pricked by thorns or fall down.
('50', 55, 6, 28, 91900) I gave the letter on Tuesday as usual, but it must have been posted late by the office here either deliberately or through negligence.
('50', 55, 6, 29, 92035) I have not complained.
('50', 55, 6, 30, 92058) You should, of course, write to me whenever you do not get the letters in time.
('50', 55, 6, 31, 92138) It is good that Punjabhai has returned.
('50', 55, 6, 32, 92178) Have you appointed anyone from the Ashram

('50', 56, 1, 2, 92263) to look after him?
('50', 56, 1, 3, 92282) I am writing to Manibhai 1 about the money for honouring the memory of the poet 2 which is lying with Reva shankerbhai.
('50', 56, 1, 4, 92402) Tell Mrs. Zaulinger that I am awaiting her reply.
('50', 56, 1, 5, 92452) She may write to me anything she wishes to without any hesitation.
('50', 56, 1, 6, 92519) You have acted rightly in regard to Kamalabehn Lundy.
('50', 56, 1, 7, 92573) For the present it is best that she should say or write nothing.
('50', 56, 1, 8, 92638) There is plenty of silent service she can do.
('50', 56, 1, 9, 92684) Balbhadra has done fine work indeed in carding.
('50', 56, 1, 10, 92732) This shows that, if we refuse to regard a person as too dull minded for a particular thing and go on encouraging him, the result is bound to be good.
('50', 56, 1, 11, 92882) I am getting on all right just now.
('50', 56, 1, 12, 92918) As usual I take milk and curds.
('50', 56, 1, 13, 92950) Instead of raisins and dates, I eat daily seven or eight tomatoes, four or five big sized, baked sweet potatoes and about six spoons of cabbage or any other vegetable that is available.
('50', 56, 1, 14, 93136) This helps me in passing stools.
('50', 56, 1, 15, 93169) I drink at 7.30 in the morning the juice of one lemon with hot water and salt.
('50', 56, 1, 16, 93248) In the afternoon, I take the juice of one lemon with soda bicarb.
('50', 56, 1, 17, 93314) If this regimen suits me, it will solve the problem of constipation and effect considerable economy.
('50', 56, 1, 18, 93415) I get the vegetables from what grows in the garden here.
('50', 56, 1, 19, 93472) If we count the expenditure, I dont.
('50', 56, 1, 20, 93509) think it exceeds two annas daily, whereas raisins and dates probably cost every day not less than six annas.
('50', 56, 1, 21, 93618) Those who suffer from constipation may try this diet.
('50', 56, 1, 22, 93672) I cannot say that it will benefit all.
('50', 56, 1, 23, 93711) About myself, too, I cannot yet say that the good effect will last.
('50', 56, 1, 24, 93779) If this experiment is followed, any other food should be avoided.
('50', 56, 1, 25, 93845) The baked sweet potatoes should be eaten by themselves and chewed well.
('50', 56, 1, 26, 93917) They should not be dipped in milk or curds.
('50', 56, 1, 27, 93961) Probably it will do no harm if one eats the skin.
('50', 56, 1, 28, 94011) I do eat some.
('50', 56, 1, 29, 94026) Because of my delicate stomach I am afraid to eat all.
('50', 56, 1, 30, 94081) Anybody else who has a similar stomach and who tries this experiment should also avoid the skin.
('50', 56, 1, 31, 94178) I would be really happy if you could find my sandals.
('50', 56, 1, 32, 94232) Kusum is bound to know about them.
('50', 56, 1, 33, 94267) She may have entrusted them to Premabehn.
('50', 56, 1, 34, 94309) If you have not yet sent the cotton send it even by post in the last resort.
('50', 56, 1, 35, 94386) Both the belts, one of six strings and the other of eight strings, were found to be too thin.
('50', 56, 1, 36, 94480) They come off the pulley and go on revolving without

('50', 57, 1, 3, 94636) Do not send me new ones in their place.
('50', 57, 1, 4, 94676) Some are ready with me and I will somehow manage to make others.
('50', 57, 1, 5, 94741) I asked you to let me know a simpler method because such a method would save my time.
('50', 57, 1, 6, 94827) September 15, 1930
('50', 57, 2, 7, 94846) My silence ended a little while ago and Kakasaheb read out to me Ramdass letter to him.
('50', 57, 2, 8, 94934) Ramdas says in it that he wrote a letter to me which I have not received.
('50', 57, 2, 9, 95008) I was very happy that Ramdas gave in the letter to Kakasaheb detailed information about his health and studies.
('50', 57, 2, 10, 95120) When he is released from jail, we shall be able to write to each other.
('50', 57, 2, 11, 95192) I shall then get any letter written by him if I can keep up this correspondence.
('50', 57, 2, 12, 95273) I send you the letters in cloth lined envelopes now.
('50', 57, 2, 13, 95326) I have with me only the envelopes received from you.
('50', 57, 2, 14, 95379) I retain their size when returning them, so that you may be able to use them again.
('50', 57, 2, 15, 95463) Otherwise I could have made them smaller and used them.
('50', 57, 2, 16, 95519) Tuesday morning, September 16, 1930 I read in papers about Ba having been harassed in Surat by the police.
('50', 57, 2, 17, 95626) Is there any truth in the report?
('50', 57, 2, 18, 95660) The law, that to live man must work, first came home to me upon reading Tolstoys writings on bread labour.
('50', 57, 2, 19, 95767) But even before that I had begun to pay homage to it after reading Ruskins Unto This Last.
('50', 57, 2, 20, 95858) The phrase jatmahenat is a translation of the English expression bread labour.
('50', 57, 2, 21, 95937) Literally it means labour for roti.
('50', 57, 2, 22, 95973) The divine law that man must earn his bread by labouring with his own hands was first stressed, not by Tolstoy but by an obscure Russian writer named T. M. Bondoref.
('50', 57, 2, 23, 96139) Tolstoy took it from him and gave it wider publicity when he accepted it.
('50', 57, 2, 24, 96213) In my view, the same principle has been set forth in Chapter III of the Gita where we are told that he who eats without offering sacrifice eats stolen food.
('50', 57, 2, 25, 96370) Sacrifice here can only mean bread labour.
('50', 57, 2, 26, 96413) Be that as it may, that verse is the origin of our observance.
('50', 57, 2, 27, 96476) Reason, too, leads us to an identical conclusion.
('50', 57, 2, 28, 96526) How can a man who does not do body labour have the right to eat?
('50', 57, 2, 29, 96591) In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread, says the Bible.
('50', 57, 2, 30, 96658) A millionaire cannot carry on for long, and will soon get tired of his life, if he rolls in his bed all day long and is even helped to his food.
('50', 57, 2, 31, 96803) He, therefore, induces hunger by exercise and helps himself to the food he eats.
('50', 57, 2, 32, 96884) If everyone, whether rich or poor, has thus to take exercise in some
('50', 58, 0, 1, 96953) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 59
('50', 58, 1, 2, 96996) shape or form, why should it not assume the form of productive labour, i.e., bread labour?
('50', 58, 1, 3, 97087) No one asks the cultivator to inhale fresh air, or to use his muscles.
('50', 58, 1, 4, 97158) And more than nine tenths of humanity lives by tilling the soil.
('50', 58, 1, 5, 97223) How much happier, healthier and more peaceful would the world become if the remaining tenth followed the example of the overwhelming majority at least to the extent of labouring enough for their food.
('50', 58, 1, 6, 97424) And many hardships connected with agriculture would be easily redressed if such people took a hand in it.
('50', 58, 1, 7, 97530) Again, invidious distinctions of rank would be abolished if everyone without exception acknowledged the obligation of bread labour.
('50', 58, 1, 8, 97662) At present these distinctions have invaded even the varna system in which there was not a trace of it originally.
('50', 58, 1, 9, 97776) There is a world wide conflict between capital and labour, and the poor envy the rich.
('50', 58, 1, 10, 97863) If all worked for their bread, distinctions of rank would be obliterated; the rich would still be there, but they would deem themselves only trustees of their property and would use it mainly in the public interest.
('50', 58, 1, 11, 98079) Bread labour is a veritable blessing to one who would observe non violence, worship Truth and make the observance of brahmacharya a natural act.
('50', 58, 1, 12, 98224) This labour can truly be related to agriculture alone.
('50', 58, 1, 13, 98279) But at present at any rate everybody is not in a position to take to it.
('50', 58, 1, 14, 98352) A person can, therefore, spin or weave, or take up carpentry or smithery, instead of tilling the soil, always regarding agriculture, however, to be the ideal.
('50', 58, 1, 15, 98511) Everyone must be his own scavenger.
('50', 58, 1, 16, 98547) Evacuation is as necessary as eating; and the best thing would be for everyone to dispose of his own waste.
('50', 58, 1, 17, 98655) If this is impossible, each family should see to its own scavenging.
('50', 58, 1, 18, 98724) I have felt for years that there must be something radically wrong where scavenging has been made the concern of a separate class in society.
('50', 58, 1, 19, 98866) We have no historical record of the man who first assigned the lowest status to this essential sanitary service.
('50', 58, 1, 20, 98979) Whoever he was, he did us no good.
('50', 58, 1, 21, 99014) We should, from our very childhood, have the idea impressed upon our minds that we are all scavengers, and the easiest way of doing so is for everyone who has realized this to commence bread labour as a scavenger.
('50', 58, 1, 22, 99228) Scavenging, thus intelligently taken up, will help one to understand religion in a different and truer light.
('50', 58, 1, 23, 99338) If children, the old and those disabled by illness do not do bread labour, that should not be regarded as violation of the law of bread labour.

('50', 59, 1, 2, 99523) The child is, as it were, included in the mother.

('50', 62, 3, 5, 102960) As you have survived the snake bite, God will certainly exact more service from you.
('50', 62, 3, 6, 103045) What treatment did you have?
('50', 62, 3, 7, 103074) Was the snake poisonous?
('50', 62, 3, 8, 103099) God will give you peace.

('50', 62, 8, 15, 103336) From now on, so long as I receive your letters, you will receive my letters too.
('50', 62, 8, 16, 103417) So, you have now become a store keeperess 2. You must become very strong in body.
('50', 62, 8, 17, 103499) Punjabhai is older than I am but he considers me his elder.
('50', 62, 8, 18, 103559) Even if a nephew is older than his uncle, it is the custom, is it not, that only the uncle can bless the nephew.
('50', 62, 8, 19, 103672) Do you understand me now?
('50', 62, 8, 20, 103698) If Anandi is missing me, all of you must keep her in good cheer.

('50', 63, 3, 8, 104231) At present it seems that God has given over your whole life to me.

('50', 63, 4, 11, 104424) The name is Gujarati or Marathi.
('50', 63, 4, 12, 104457) It is certainly not Tamil.
('50', 63, 4, 13, 104484) If she is a Tamil, she may be excused.

('50', 64, 2, 3, 105302) YERAVDA CENTRAL PRISON, September 21, 1930
('50', 64, 3, 4, 105345) DEAR MAJOR MARTIN,
('50', 64, 4, 5, 105364) I must now unburden myself of my second difficulty.
('50', 64, 4, 6, 105416) I do not doubt a word of what you have told me about the charges of alleged ill treatment in this prison.
('50', 64, 4, 7, 105522) Yet I cannot dispel from my mind all the reports that have appeared in the Press.
('50', 64, 4, 8, 105604) The writers could not have deliberately lied about everything.
('50', 64, 4, 9, 105667) I am sure that some of the statements are gross exaggerations.
('50', 64, 4, 10, 105730) I hope that most are, and I should like to believe that all are false.
('50', 64, 4, 11, 105801) But my mind is disturbed.
('50', 64, 4, 12, 105827) There may be things you do not know; there must be things which you look at from one angle and the prisoners concerned from another.
('50', 64, 4, 13, 105960) My duty in the circumstances seems to be plain.
('50', 64, 4, 14, 106008) I must ask to be allowed to see them occasionally, if I may not be permitted to live with them.
('50', 64, 4, 15, 106104) I have told you I desire no privileges.
('50', 64, 4, 16, 106144) What comforts are allowed to me may be taken away from me.
('50', 64, 4, 17, 106203) If I am isolated for the sake of the comforts, they mean little to me, whereas isolation means everything to me.
('50', 64, 4, 18, 106316) I desire no comforts that may not be allowed to the other prisoners suffering from the same physical disabilities as I. I do not believe in classification which, in my opinion, is degrading.
('50', 64, 4, 19, 106507) If I permit myself comforts which the other prisoners like me do not enjoy, I do so because of my physical needs 1. But I would fain sacrifice health if it has to be purchased by the sacrifice of the privilege of serving my companions, many of whom I know and none of whom I consider to be in any way inferior to me.
('50', 64, 4, 20, 106824) I was able to bear the separation so long as I was under the impression that all was well.
('50', 64, 4, 21, 106915) But the knowledge that young Ratilal is no more, that Pyarelal who is like a son to me has been suffering, that the elderly Narsinhabhai was near deaths door and the persistent complaints in the Press have awakened me to a sense of my duty, viz., that I should strive to the utmost of my ability to establish touch with them.

('50', 65, 0, 1, 107323) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 65, 1, 2, 107364) I know that it is not in your or the I. G. P.s power to grant me the permission requested.
('50', 65, 1, 3, 107455) I would therefore ask you please to place this letter before the Government and secure an early reply.
('50', 65, 1, 4, 107558) I am aware as prisoner I have no rights and no choice as to the disposal of my body.
('50', 65, 1, 5, 107643) But I know also that the upkeep of my body requires my co operation.
('50', 65, 1, 6, 107712) I should no longer be interested [in] the preservation of a body that cannot be used for the service that the dweller within yearns after.
('50', 65, 1, 7, 107851) I am human.
('50', 65, 1, 8, 107863) Even as a prisoner I cannot divest myself of the human in me.
('50', 65, 1, 9, 107925) I need not give the assurance, perhaps you will be able to give it, if any be required, that my presence among my companions will not be used to subvert discipline but on the contrary, it is highly likely to promote it.
('50', 65, 1, 10, 108145) The moral code of a civil resister requires him willingly to submit to all prison discipline that is not in conflict with self respect.
('50', 65, 1, 11, 108281) Lastly I would like to draw the Governments attention to the fact that when a somewhat similar incident occurred in 1923 in this very prison, I was allowed to see two prisoners with the result that what promised to be a grave tragedy was averted.
('50', 65, 1, 12, 108528) 1 The present Inspector General of Police is aware of the facts of the case.
('50', 65, 1, 13, 108605) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('50', 65, 5, 17, 108753) LILAVATI, I got your letter.
('50', 65, 5, 18, 108782) If you do not become impatient, you are bound to get the strength to put your ideals into practice.
('50', 65, 5, 19, 108882) As we get indigestion if we start eating all at once, so also we fail in our attempt if we try to put anything in practice without first judging our capacity and this gives rise to despair.
('50', 65, 5, 20, 109072) If we ourselves cannot judge our capacity we should follow the advice of some person in whose judgment we have faith and who has given the advice after considering our capacity.
('50', 65, 5, 21, 109250) It will be enough if, after pouring out your heart before Gangabehn, you do what she asks you to do.

('50', 66, 8, 17, 110035) We are where our mind is.
('50', 66, 8, 18, 110061) Dont we sometimes feel that while our body is in one place, our mind is in another?
('50', 66, 8, 19, 110145) Where is the mind of a person who is dead?
('50', 66, 8, 20, 110188) I know it is easy to say this, but difficult to live in that spirit.
('50', 66, 8, 21, 110257) But, as you had mentioned wings, I have poured out this wisdom.

('50', 67, 3, 6, 110637) I have not let a single week pass without writing to you.
('50', 67, 3, 7, 110695) I keep good health.
('50', 67, 3, 8, 110715) The weight is 103. Instead of raisins, I eat gourd or some other vegetable.
('50', 67, 3, 9, 110791) Milk and curds remain of course.

('50', 67, 8, 20, 111159) How is that?
('50', 67, 8, 21, 111172) If there are mosquitoes, you should ignore what others say and use a mosquito net.
('50', 67, 8, 22, 111255) If you cannot fix one, you may rub kerosene [on your body].
('50', 67, 8, 23, 111315) I cannot straightway request the authorities to keep Pyarelal with me.
('50', 67, 8, 24, 111386) I had not made such a request even for Kaka.
('50', 67, 8, 25, 111431) It is the authorities who transferred him.
('50', 67, 8, 26, 111474) I am, however, trying to see Pyarelal.
('50', 67, 8, 27, 111513) I made a request to be permitted to see him as soon as I heard that he was suffering from diarrhoea.
('50', 67, 8, 28, 111614) He is better now.
('50', 67, 8, 29, 111632) You should remember that I do not know who are lodged in this jail.
('50', 67, 8, 30, 111700) You should assume that I am confined in a cage.

('50', 68, 3, 6, 112025) Forget that she is your wife.
('50', 68, 3, 7, 112055) Regard her as one of the countless women.
('50', 68, 3, 8, 112097) Also forget the children that are with her.
('50', 68, 3, 9, 112141) Regard them as not yours.
('50', 68, 3, 10, 112167) Since you are susceptible to carnal urge, you should understand that you have no right to [accept] service from Manibehn even as a sister.
('50', 68, 3, 11, 112306) You should not call to mind whom you have to forget; leave, therefore, all worry on her account and shake the burden off your mind.
('50', 68, 3, 12, 112438) Show this letter to Gangabehn who will help you to act on this.

('50', 70, 3, 4, 114342) MRIDU, I was happy to read your letter containing your account of the events.
('50', 70, 3, 5, 114420) I have not reproached you at all.
('50', 70, 3, 6, 114454) What right have I to reproach you from here?
('50', 70, 3, 7, 114499) I have only warned you.
('50', 70, 3, 8, 114523) A volunteer, man or woman, who is not cautious, gets defeated.
('50', 70, 3, 9, 114586) Knowing your nature, I merely warned you.
('50', 70, 3, 10, 114628) Those whose means are truth and non violence, have as their guide God who is known as Truth.
('50', 70, 3, 11, 114721) That is the gist of the last stanza of the last chapter of the Gita.
('50', 70, 3, 12, 114790) Adhering to it as if clinging to a tree, leap as far as you can.
('50', 70, 3, 13, 114855) god will protect you.

('50', 70, 7, 17, 115004) September 21, 1930
('50', 70, 8, 18, 115023) BHARATI 1, I was very happy to have your letter written in such a beautiful hand.
('50', 70, 8, 19, 115105) You have a perfect right to write to me.
('50', 70, 8, 20, 115146) I should like it very much if you wrote to all your brothers and sisters.
('50', 70, 8, 21, 115220) My circle of young friends is vast and I am constantly adding to it.
('50', 70, 8, 22, 115289) Some jealous young men in order to denigrate the old, have made fun of them, treating them as children.
('50', 70, 8, 23, 115393) If the old really become as innocent as children, the denigration will be turned into praise.
('50', 70, 8, 24, 115487) I cherish the hope of getting such a certificate and so continue to enlarge my circle of young friends.
('50', 70, 8, 25, 115591) All you brothers and sisters should join that circle and keep writing to me.
('50', 70, 8, 26, 115668) Your handwriting is good.
('50', 70, 8, 27, 115694) You must devote a little more attention to l] .k and r.

('50', 71, 3, 4, 115959) KANTA, I have your letter.
('50', 71, 3, 5, 115986) It is well that you have sought our Kamalabehns 1 company.
('50', 71, 3, 6, 116045) Try to understand her.
('50', 71, 3, 7, 116068) Do learn from her the art of nursing.
('50', 71, 3, 8, 116106) You may if you wish add salt to the curd, but do not forget that adding salt only changes the sour taste of curd, it does not neutralize the acidity.
('50', 71, 3, 9, 116256) I therefore suggest that when the curd tastes sour you should add soda to it.
('50', 71, 3, 10, 116334) Soda neutralizes the acid in the curd.
('50', 71, 3, 11, 116373) The acid combines with the soda and evaporatesin the form of carbolic acid gas, leaving the curd sweet.

('50', 71, 8, 17, 116647) MY DEAR KUMARAPPA, Let me point out a flaw in your calculation.
('50', 71, 8, 18, 116711) If you return the compliment, you should find out the love notes I send every week.
('50', 71, 8, 19, 116795) So if love may be measured arithmetically your notes must be as many times long as all my notes put together.
('50', 71, 8, 20, 116905) But thank God!
('50', 71, 8, 21, 116920) Love ignores and falsifies both arithmetic and geometry.
('50', 71, 8, 22, 116977) Yes, Kamalabehn is doing very well indeed.

('50', 72, 3, 4, 117170) MIRA, I have your Calcutta letter.
('50', 72, 3, 5, 117205) You are having a variety of experiences 1. Seekers after Truth turn every one of these to good account.
('50', 72, 3, 6, 117309) I hope the little illness you had was but a passing thing and that you were yourself again quickly.
('50', 72, 3, 7, 117409) I hope you had the rest you wanted.
('50', 72, 3, 8, 117445) I am daily making slight improvements in the travelling wheel and it gives me less and less trouble.
('50', 72, 3, 9, 117546) It is wonderful what a number ofdetails you have to attend to when you have not a perfected machine but a contrivance to help the cunning of your hands.
('50', 72, 3, 10, 117699) But the greater the mastery over the wheel, the greater is the pleasure of spinning and the less the fatigue.
('50', 72, 3, 11, 117809) Kaka is still struggling with your wheel.
('50', 72, 3, 12, 117851) He has much past neglect to make up for.
('50', 72, 3, 13, 117892) He says, he has becomea spinner only here.
('50', 72, 3, 14, 117935) Before, he was spinning but he was no spinner.
('50', 72, 3, 15, 117982) You know what I mean.
('50', 72, 3, 16, 118004) A man can make a table without being a cabinet maker.
('50', 72, 3, 17, 118058) The change to vegetables persists.
('50', 72, 3, 18, 118093) There is no setback nor is there visible further progress.
('50', 72, 3, 19, 118152) I want to give this experiment a full trial.
('50', 72, 3, 20, 118197) Dr. Mehta sent word that perhaps sweet potatoes might induce constipation.
('50', 72, 3, 21, 118272) I have therefore dropped them today.
('50', 72, 3, 22, 118309) Tomatoes are a daily adjunct and a green vegetable.
('50', 72, 3, 23, 118361) You will give my love to friends wherever you are.

('50', 72, 5, 26, 118598) Nevertheless she proceeded to join the procession which was lathi charged.
('50', 72, 5, 27, 118673) She was taken to a police station and later allowed to leave.
('50', 72, 5, 28, 118735) Some university students who shouted at the police for being rough with the women were mercilessly beaten.
('50', 72, 5, 29, 118842) The incidents which led to a hartal the next day are described, in some detail by Mirabehn in her autobiography The Spirits Pilgrimage, pp.

('50', 73, 3, 4, 119074) GANGABEHN (SENIOR), When I dont get a letter from you, I cannot help feeling that something is wrong.
('50', 73, 3, 5, 119176) Why should you feel depressed?
('50', 73, 3, 6, 119207) Whenever you feel so, you should immediately pass on your depression to me.
('50', 73, 3, 7, 119283) Whatever your age, from the very first day that I met you I have regarded you as a dear daughter.
('50', 73, 3, 8, 119381) I can be both a father and a mother.
('50', 73, 3, 9, 119418) You should, therefore, immediately let me share your depression and then be at peace.
('50', 73, 3, 10, 119504) If you feel like coming to see Kaka, take the plunge some time.
('50', 73, 3, 11, 119568) behn 1 is certainly guilty of one mistake, that she went to test Bhagwanji.
('50', 73, 3, 12, 119644) Nevertheless, as long as she is eager to remain in the Ashram and struggle for self improvement, we should let her remain.
('50', 73, 3, 13, 119767) Our experiments are certainly dangerous.
('50', 73, 3, 14, 119808) God will see us through them all, if we have but faith in Him.

('50', 74, 3, 4, 120524) PANDITJI, It is with a little effort that I can bring myself to put Chi. before your name.
('50', 74, 3, 5, 120615) I do feel for you the love which Chi. would suggest, but I may not have always shown it outwardly.
('50', 74, 3, 6, 120714) I got your letter.
('50', 74, 3, 7, 120733) Learn carding quickly.
('50', 74, 3, 8, 120756) As for spinning, set apart, if possible, a fixed time for it.
('50', 74, 3, 9, 120818) The absence of love of khadi which you notice around you is but a reflection of some deficiency in us.
('50', 74, 3, 10, 120921) We are the centre of the khadi movement.
('50', 74, 3, 11, 120962) Just as if the sun shines with less heat the temperature around is bound to go down, so also if we shine with less heat, that is, if we are lukewarm ourselves about khadi, what wonder that there should be a lack of warmth outside?
('50', 74, 3, 12, 121193) But love is not acquired from outside; it must spring from within.
('50', 74, 3, 13, 121260) If we strive for such love to spring from within us, good results are bound to follow.
('50', 74, 3, 14, 121347) It was very good indeed that Rambhau 1 went to Almora.

('50', 74, 8, 22, 121737) Describe to me your experiences in jail.

('50', 76, 3, 4, 123520) NARANDAS, Where is Kamala Gandhi at present?
('50', 76, 3, 5, 123565) I feel worried about her because I have had no letter from her for a long time.
('50', 76, 3, 6, 123645) Where is Haridas?
('50', 76, 3, 7, 123663) What is he doing?
('50', 76, 3, 8, 123681) Prabhavati complains, in her letters of the last two weeks, that she gets no letters from me.
('50', 76, 3, 9, 123775) I have been writing to her regularly.
('50', 76, 3, 10, 123813) Has she given her correct address to you?
('50', 76, 3, 11, 123855) The name of the place is Sitaldiara.
('50', 76, 3, 12, 123892) As regards Harilal Desai, read the letter I have written to him.
('50', 76, 3, 13, 123957) He is likely to be an asset to us.
('50', 76, 3, 14, 123992) Pay him between Rs. 60 and Rs. 65 for his family and Rs. 40 for his own expenses.
('50', 76, 3, 15, 124074) In all, the amount may come to Rs. 100 a month.
('50', 76, 3, 16, 124122) As for the training, it will be best to adopt the method I have suggested.
('50', 76, 3, 17, 124197) During the time that he is in the Ashram, I think his expenses will be less.
('50', 76, 3, 18, 124274) They will, I believe, go up to Rs. 40 when he goes outside the Ashram for studying.
('50', 76, 3, 19, 124358) Explain further details and make the position clear as you may think fit.
('50', 76, 3, 20, 124432) Is my suggestion all right?
('50', 76, 3, 21, 124460) I suppose Valjibhai knows all this.
('50', 76, 3, 22, 124496) If Giriraj does not recover his calm there, I think it would be best to let him go to Wardha.
('50', 76, 3, 23, 124590) However, do what you think proper.
('50', 76, 3, 24, 124625) Read the letter to Nanibehn (Budhabhais).
('50', 76, 3, 25, 124667) Read the letter to Budhabhai, too, and, if Nanibehn agrees, make the arrangements suggested by him.
('50', 76, 3, 26, 124767) If, however, she feels hurt, do not interfere.
('50', 76, 3, 27, 124814) Read the letter to Manibehn before you give it to her to read.
('50', 76, 3, 28, 124877) Let Gangabehn, too, read it.
('50', 76, 3, 29, 124906) And also read the letter to Zainu.
('50', 76, 3, 30, 124941) If he does not understand the position even after this explanation, remember that he is a guest and tolerate his absence.
('50', 76, 3, 31, 125063) Read the letter to Bhagwanji, too.
('50', 76, 3, 32, 125098) I think the only medicine for him is the one I have suggested.
('50', 76, 3, 33, 125161) You have done quite right in sending Balkrishna to Vinoba.
('50', 76, 3, 34, 125220) You also did well in offering to send others.
('50', 76, 3, 35, 125266) It fills me with great joy to know that the boys and girls have taken charge of the prayers.
('50', 76, 3, 36, 125359) And, moreover, no light is required!
('50', 76, 3, 37, 125396) My effort to memorize [the Gita verses] is in abeyance for the time being.
('50', 76, 3, 38, 125471) I simply do not get the necessary time.
('50', 76, 3, 39, 125511) What work can a prisoner have to keep him so busy?
('50', 76, 3, 40, 125562) But that is how it is.
('50', 76, 3, 41, 125585) I have to be careful about every minute.
('50', 76, 3, 42, 125626) I read a little by snatching a few minutes from other work.
('50', 76, 3, 43, 125686) I agree with your opinion about mixed picketing.
('50', 76, 3, 44, 125735) Read the letter to Joshi.
('50', 76, 3, 45, 125761) I got the cotton and the leather, and Kakasaheb his
('50', 77, 0, 1, 125813) 78 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 77, 1, 2, 125854) sandals.
('50', 77, 1, 3, 125863) I got mine repaired and they should now last me for at least two or three months.
('50', 77, 1, 4, 125945) I accept your namaskars on your birthday.
('50', 77, 1, 5, 125987) May God strengthen your soul and grant you a long life.

('50', 77, 3, 7, 126079) EQUALITY OF RELIGIONS.
('50', 77, 3, 8, 126102) This is the new name we have given to the Ashram observance which we know as Tolerance.
('50', 77, 3, 9, 126190) Sahishnuta is a translation of the English word Tolerance.
('50', 77, 3, 10, 126249) I did not like that word, but could not think of a better one.
('50', 77, 3, 11, 126312) Kakasaheb, too, did not like that word.
('50', 77, 3, 12, 126352) He suggested Respect for all religions.
('50', 77, 3, 13, 126392) I didnt like that phrase either.
('50', 77, 3, 14, 126425) Tolerance may imply a gratuitous assumption of the inferiority of other faiths to ones own and respect suggests a sense of patronizing whereas ahimsa teaches us to entertain the same respect for the religious faiths of others as we accord to our own, thus admitting the imperfection of the latter.
('50', 77, 3, 15, 126723) This admission will be readily made by a seeker of Truth, who follows the law of Love.
('50', 77, 3, 16, 126810) If we had attained the full vision of Truth, we would no longer be mere seekers, but would have become one with God, for Truth is God.
('50', 77, 3, 17, 126945) But being only seekers, we prosecute our quest, and are conscious of our imperfection.
('50', 77, 3, 18, 127032) And if we are imperfect ourselves, religion as conceived by us must also be imperfect.
('50', 77, 3, 19, 127119) We have not realized religion in its perfection, even as we have not realized God.
('50', 77, 3, 20, 127202) Religion of our conception, being thus imperfect, is always subject to a process of evolution and re interpretation.
('50', 77, 3, 21, 127319) Progress towards Truth, towards God, is possible only because of such evolution.
('50', 77, 3, 22, 127400) And if all faiths outlined by men are imperfect, the question of comparative merit does not arise.
('50', 77, 3, 23, 127499) All faiths constitute a revelation of Truth, but all are imperfect and liable to error.
('50', 77, 3, 24, 127587) Reverence for other faiths need not blind us to their faults.
('50', 77, 3, 25, 127649) We must be keenly alive to the defects of our own faith also, yet not leave it on that account, but try to overcome those defects.
('50', 77, 3, 26, 127780) Looking at all religions with an equal eye, we would not only not hesitate, but would think it our duty, to blend into our faith every acceptable feature of other faiths.
('50', 77, 3, 27, 127951) The question then arises: why should there be so many different faiths?
('50', 77, 3, 28, 128023) The soul is one, but the bodies which she animates are many.
('50', 77, 3, 29, 128084) We cannot reduce the number of bodies; yet we recognize the unity of the soul.
('50', 77, 3, 30, 128163) Even as a tree has a single trunk, but many branches and leaves, so is there one true and perfect Religion, but it becomes many as it passes through the human medium.
('50', 78, 0, 1, 128330) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 79
('50', 78, 1, 2, 128373) All religions are divinely inspired, but they are imperfect because they are products of the human mind and taught by human beings.
('50', 78, 1, 3, 128505) The one Religion is beyond all speech.
('50', 78, 1, 4, 128544) Imperfect men put it into such language as they can command and their words are interpreted by other men equally imperfect.
('50', 78, 1, 5, 128668) Whose interpretation is to be held to be the right one?
('50', 78, 1, 6, 128724) Everybody is right from his own standpoint, but it is not impossible that everybody may be wrong.
('50', 78, 1, 7, 128822) Hence the necessity for tolerance, which does not mean indifference towards ones own faith, but a more intelligent and purer love for it.
('50', 78, 1, 8, 128960) Tolerance gives us spiritual insight, which is as far from fanaticism as the north pole is from the south.
('50', 78, 1, 9, 129067) True knowledge of religion breaks down the barriers between faith and faith.
('50', 78, 1, 10, 129144) Cultivation of tolerance for other faiths will impart to us a truer understanding of our own.
('50', 78, 1, 11, 129238) Tolerance obviously does not disturb the distinction between right and wrong, or good and evil.
('50', 78, 1, 12, 129334) The reference here throughout is naturally to the principal faiths of the world.
('50', 78, 1, 13, 129415) They are all based on common fundamentals.
('50', 78, 1, 14, 129458) They have all produced great saints.
('50', 78, 1, 15, 129495) There is some difference between tolerance towards other religions and tolerance towards their followers.
('50', 78, 1, 16, 129601) We should have equal regard for all human beingsfor the wicked as for the saintly, for the impious as for the piousbut we should never tolerate irreligion.
('50', 78, 1, 17, 129757) This idea may need elaboration.
('50', 78, 1, 18, 129789) If you do not follow it easily, ask me.
('50', 78, 2, 19, 129829) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] If you have not followed the discourse fully, it would be best not to translate it.

('50', 78, 6, 26, 130198) Later I realized that this insistence was wrong.

('50', 79, 1, 3, 130367) We must recognize this fact.
('50', 79, 1, 4, 130396) Besides there is no single calendar accepted throughout India.
('50', 79, 1, 5, 130459) Different regions follow different calendars.
('50', 79, 1, 6, 130505) Surely we are not going to reject everything foreign.
('50', 79, 1, 7, 130559) There are other arguments too.

('50', 79, 11, 25, 131275) You have done well in adopting Madalasa as your sister.
('50', 79, 11, 26, 131331) She is a very good and simple hearted girl.
('50', 79, 11, 27, 131375) I like your decision to observe brahm charya.
('50', 79, 11, 28, 131421) Simple food is very essential for that.

('50', 79, 11, 30, 131533) You should never let impure thoughts enter your mind.
('50', 79, 11, 31, 131587) For that you must always think good thoughts and try to live according to them.

('50', 80, 6, 9, 132174) MY DEAR MATHEW,
('50', 80, 7, 10, 132190) The things you write about are ultimately decided by faith.
('50', 80, 7, 11, 132250) Reason can take us only a little distance.
('50', 80, 7, 12, 132293) Man is a person, God is not in the same sense.
('50', 80, 7, 13, 132340) Man sins because he has the sense of right and wrong.
('50', 80, 7, 14, 132394) Our difficulty arises through our effort to measure God by our little selves.
('50', 80, 7, 15, 132472) And He eludes all measure.

('50', 80, 13, 20, 132588) I got your letter.
('50', 80, 13, 21, 132607) I wrote to you about Pyarelal in my last letter.
('50', 80, 13, 22, 132656) I have not yet been able to see him, but I can get news about him now.
('50', 80, 13, 23, 132727) I shall of course be able to see him.
('50', 80, 13, 24, 132765) Whether he will be kept with me rests on Gods will.
('50', 80, 13, 25, 132817) In any case, we shall meet when I am released and he will live with me then.
('50', 80, 13, 26, 132894) But who knows what the future holds?
('50', 80, 13, 27, 132931) Kakasaheb will be released at the end of November.
('50', 80, 13, 28, 132982) I suppose Pyarelals term will also have expired by then.
('50', 80, 13, 29, 133039) At last, he now finds support in the Gita and the Ramayana and I feel greatly relieved.
('50', 80, 13, 30, 133127) I could not understand why they did not help him till now.

('50', 82, 3, 7, 134573) Your letter was very good.

('50', 84, 7, 14, 137162) That is what is meant by the Gita verses describing the character of the sthita prajna, which we daily recite.
('50', 84, 7, 15, 137273) If we go on reciting them every day, with sincere devotion in our hearts, some day we shall be able to live in that spirit.

('50', 88, 12, 14, 142079) I have your letter.
('50', 88, 12, 15, 142099) You did not get or take even the full four days rest at Muzaffarpur.
('50', 88, 12, 16, 142168) Next time I should stick to such promises.
('50', 88, 12, 17, 142211) Why should rest not be taken in the spirit of service?
('50', 88, 12, 18, 142266) Of course, it can be easily abused and often is.
('50', 88, 12, 19, 142315) But that is no reason why honest people may not honestly give themselves rest so as to enable them to keep fit for further service.
('50', 88, 12, 20, 142447) I regard it as self delusion if not worse when a person says he is wearing himself away in service.
('50', 88, 12, 21, 142547) Is such service preferred by God to service steadily and detachedly performed?
('50', 88, 12, 22, 142626) Body is like a machine requiring to be well kept for full service.
('50', 88, 12, 23, 142693) Enough however of sermonizing from a safe retreat.
('50', 88, 12, 24, 142744) Only I do feel that I have not felt ashamed to take the required rest.
('50', 88, 12, 25, 142815) That people about me have thought otherwise is because of their ignorance of the laws of rest.
('50', 88, 12, 26, 142910) Rest properly and in due time taken is like the proverbial timely stitch.

('50', 89, 1, 5, 143138) Yesterday was the third day and he pulled 119 in one hour.

('50', 89, 1, 7, 143227) I am making daily progress and do not know what fatigue is on that wheel.

('50', 89, 1, 15, 143704) I want to reach a high standard both in spinning and carding.
('50', 89, 1, 16, 143766) There is no reason why I should stop at 160 rounds per hour.

('50', 89, 1, 18, 143874) For me it is Gods work.

('50', 89, 7, 32, 144478) Give up the idea of being polluted by anyones touch.

('50', 89, 7, 34, 144555) Take interest in all the activities of Jaisukhlal.

('50', 90, 3, 7, 145020) Now I understand the cause of the pain which she suffers.
('50', 90, 3, 8, 145078) Is she as happy still as she was at first?
('50', 90, 3, 9, 145121) While strictly adhering to your principles, see that you do not hurt Kasumba.
('50', 90, 3, 10, 145199) She has the same freedom of conduct which we claim for ourselves.
('50', 90, 3, 11, 145265) If you get angry with her, she will only suppress her real feelings.
('50', 90, 3, 12, 145334) I have made that mistake myself and I tell you this from experience.
('50', 90, 3, 13, 145403) I have observed some fine qualities in Kasumba.
('50', 90, 3, 14, 145451) But why should it matter even if she does not have any?

('50', 91, 7, 19, 147183) Probably the general weakness of your body is partly responsible for the slow recovery.

('50', 92, 10, 12, 147903) Do not worry about letters from me.
('50', 92, 10, 13, 147939) I will continue to write to you every week so long as I am able to write letters.
('50', 92, 10, 14, 148021) How are you now?
('50', 92, 10, 15, 148038) What are you reading in English?
('50', 92, 10, 16, 148071) How much are you able to read every day?
('50', 92, 10, 17, 148112) Have you learnt to starch the yarn?
('50', 92, 10, 18, 148148) Do you weave on the flying shuttle loom or on the small loom?
('50', 92, 10, 19, 148210) Blessings to brother.

('50', 93, 3, 4, 148453) BALBHADRA, I got your letter.
('50', 93, 3, 5, 148483) It was a good one.
('50', 93, 3, 6, 148502) You can write one still better.
('50', 93, 3, 7, 148534) What is the cause of your losing weight?
('50', 93, 3, 8, 148575) Do you chew your food properly?
('50', 93, 3, 9, 148607) Are you suffering from any disease?
('50', 93, 3, 10, 148643) How much milk do you drink?
('50', 93, 3, 11, 148671) Your weight must improve.
('50', 93, 3, 12, 148697) Show this letter to Narandas and follow his advice.

('50', 93, 8, 18, 148917) MAHALAKSHMI, Was there any letter of yours which remained unanswered?
('50', 93, 8, 19, 148987) Of course I do remember all of you women every day.
('50', 93, 8, 20, 149039) I too would have been glad if you could have spent a few months with me.
('50', 93, 8, 21, 149112) But both of you have made such progress, even while you were away from me, that I cannot imagine what you could have achieved if you had been all the time with me.
('50', 93, 8, 22, 149276) It is good that the children still live on fruit and so on and that you have come back to it.
('50', 93, 8, 23, 149370) Why has Dahibehn not written?

('50', 94, 3, 4, 149579) PUNJABHAI (JUNIOR, BARODA), I got your letter.
('50', 94, 3, 5, 149626) Your illness has lasted too long.
('50', 94, 3, 6, 149660) That is always the way of the body.
('50', 94, 3, 7, 149696) It is more brittle even than a glass bangle.
('50', 94, 3, 8, 149741) We should, therefore, take care of it only in order that we may be able to serve others.
('50', 94, 3, 9, 149830) Get well soon.

('50', 94, 8, 15, 149994) DEAR SISTER, I have your two letters to answer.
('50', 94, 8, 16, 150042) First, Satis Babus question.
('50', 94, 8, 17, 150071) The literal interpretation of the battle in Chapter II of the Gita may certainly be physical conflict.
('50', 94, 8, 18, 150174) But I have not a shadow of doubt that the spirit of the Gita inclines us to interpret it as mental conflict.
('50', 94, 8, 19, 150283) The moment this is doubted, the Gita will cease to be sacred scripture for me.
('50', 94, 8, 20, 150362) I hope you are well.
('50', 94, 8, 21, 150383) After consulting Vinoba, do send the boys desirous of learning Sanskrit to Wardha.
('50', 94, 8, 22, 150466) Chhotelal is now in jail.
('50', 94, 8, 23, 150492) I am very glad to note even the slight improvement in Tarini.
('50', 94, 8, 24, 150554) Give my blessings to Tarini, Charu, Arun and others.
('50', 94, 8, 25, 150607) The tapovanas 1 like those of ancient India can exist even now, it all depends upon our tapashcharya.
('50', 94, 8, 26, 150709) Certainly their form may be different.
('50', 94, 8, 27, 150748) Our duty lies in going a step ahead of the achievements of our ancestors.

('50', 95, 2, 3, 150972) YERAVDA CENTRAL PRISON, September 30, 1930
('50', 95, 3, 4, 151015) DEAR MAJOR MARTIN, It was on 21st instant that I sent you my letter requesting that I should be permitted to establish touch with the civil resistance prisoners in this jail.
('50', 95, 3, 5, 151190) I made the request about seeing my secretary and co worker Pyarelal even earlier.
('50', 95, 3, 6, 151272) I must now press for an early answer.
('50', 95, 3, 7, 151310) I know the Governments preoccupations and, as a prisoner, I should like to spare them all the trouble l can on my behalf.
('50', 95, 3, 8, 151432) But the request I have made is a peremptory call of my fundamental being.
('50', 95, 3, 9, 151506) I can no longer restrain myself now.
('50', 95, 3, 10, 151543) The deprivation of touch with these fellow prisoners is unbearable for me.
('50', 95, 3, 11, 151618) Unless, therefore, I get satisfaction by Saturday noon next, I must begin to withdraw my co operation as to the upkeep of my body.
('50', 95, 3, 12, 151749) To what extent I shall carry the non co operation, I am unable to say at present.
('50', 95, 3, 13, 151831) It will be determined, as the days proceed, by the inner urge and my courage and strength.
('50', 95, 3, 14, 151922) The commencement will be made with my refusing all food except the ordinary convict diet, i.e., such of it as I can religiously take.
('50', 95, 3, 15, 152056) I can take only five natural ingredients in addition to salt.
('50', 95, 3, 16, 152118) Therefore so far as I can see, I can take only kanji and bajari and juwari chapati.
('50', 95, 3, 17, 152202) I may not take dal or vegetables as they contain more than five ingredients.
('50', 95, 3, 18, 152279) The kanji and chapati I shall take on the responsibility of and at the desire of the authorities.
('50', 95, 3, 19, 152377) I am not sure that after years of abstention from them, my system can cope with either.
('50', 95, 3, 20, 152465) I have arrived at this compromise to start with, because I am anxious to cause as little embarrassment as I can.
('50', 95, 3, 21, 152578) I would like the Government not to regard this letter as a threat but consider it as an act of courtesy and consideration.
('50', 95, 3, 22, 152701) My desire is not to take the Government unawares in any serious steps I may take in order to vindicate what is to me a human right.
('50', 95, 4, 23, 152833) Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI

('50', 96, 1, 2, 152978) 148. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('50', 96, 2, 3, 153009) September 25/30, 1930
('50', 96, 3, 4, 153031) NARANDAS, This time I start with your letter.
('50', 96, 3, 5, 153077) Last week I ran short of time and had to be very brief about some points.
('50', 96, 3, 6, 153151) Write and tell me, if you know, all about the persons who live in Rajagopalacharis Ashram, where Subbiah and his wife are and so on.
('50', 96, 3, 7, 153284) Punjabhai must now endure his suffering and pass his days in peace.
('50', 96, 3, 8, 153352) If you can, have a further discussion with Mrs. Zaulinger.
('50', 96, 3, 9, 153411) She seems to be a wise and good lady, but she takes time to understand our point of view in everything.
('50', 96, 3, 10, 153515) I dont see anything wrong in letting her join the night watch, if she feels so inclined.
('50', 96, 3, 11, 153604) Her argument is correct.
('50', 96, 3, 12, 153629) Indian sisters may not be ready to move as freely as she is ready to do; if, however, anyone wishes to join her, she may.
('50', 96, 3, 13, 153751) I have merely expressed a view from here without knowing all the circumstances there.
('50', 96, 3, 14, 153837) Do what you yourself think proper.
('50', 96, 3, 15, 153872) What shall I say about Keshu and others?
('50', 96, 3, 16, 153913) Read the letter which I shall write to them this time and give it to them.
('50', 96, 3, 17, 153988) Keshu is an upright young man.
('50', 96, 3, 18, 154019) He will probably understand his dharma in the course of time, and so I dont feel like writing anything to him.
('50', 96, 3, 19, 154130) You, for your part, should be bold and tell him what you think right.
('50', 96, 3, 20, 154200) This time, of course, I will write to him.
('50', 96, 3, 21, 154243) My diet consists of three pounds of milk turned into curds and taken at two meals, and milk once.
('50', 96, 3, 22, 154341) Then nine tomatoes, small or big as supplied and the required quantity of boiled vegetables such as cabbage, pumpkin, etc.
('50', 96, 3, 23, 154464) I add salt afterwards if I require.
('50', 96, 3, 24, 154500) I gave up sweet potatoes four days ago.
('50', 96, 3, 25, 154540) Dr. Jivraj visited Kakasaheb and he thought that it would cause constipation.
('50', 96, 3, 26, 154618) I had again found it necessary to take enemas.
('50', 96, 3, 27, 154665) I, therefore, decided to see the effect of giving up sweet potatoes.
('50', 96, 3, 28, 154734) I observe no change.
('50', 96, 3, 29, 154755) If I keep up my strength, I will not resume sweet potatoes.
('50', 96, 3, 30, 154815) I didnt think they were doing me any harm.
('50', 96, 3, 31, 154858) It is the water of this place which seems to cause constipation to a person of my constitution.
('50', 96, 3, 32, 154954) There is, however, no cause for worry at all.
('50', 96, 3, 33, 155000) I shall be weighed this evening and will mention the weight in this letter.
('50', 96, 3, 34, 155076) Enemas are nothing new to me, but I should certainly like to do without them if possible.
('50', 96, 3, 35, 155166) I wish to carry on without fresh fruit as long as I can.
('50', 96, 3, 36, 155223) If by eating vegetables I do not
('50', 97, 0, 1, 155256) 98 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 97, 1, 2, 155297) succeed in getting rid of enemas and if I feel weak in the slightest degree, I will resume dates and raisins.
('50', 97, 1, 3, 155407) No one should worry on my account.
('50', 97, 1, 4, 155442) My spinning is improving.
('50', 97, 1, 5, 155468) The speed seems to be increasing.
('50', 97, 1, 6, 155502) At any rate, I dont feel tired now.
('50', 97, 1, 7, 155538) I will not be too eager for the present to increase the output.
('50', 97, 1, 8, 155602) I feel a little unhappy that I have had to abandon the effort to memorize the Gita verses.
('50', 97, 1, 9, 155693) But I am waiting for an opportunity to resume it.
('50', 97, 1, 10, 155743) In the beginning, I used to try to memorize them while spinning.
('50', 97, 1, 11, 155808) But I saw that that interfered with the spinning.
('50', 97, 1, 12, 155858) I realize every day the necessity for ever more concentration for good spinning.
('50', 97, 1, 13, 155939) I see that there is a great difference between mere spinning and the art of spinning.
('50', 97, 1, 14, 156025) I wish to learn the art.
('50', 97, 1, 15, 156050) Maybe I shall not succeed in acquiring it during this life.
('50', 97, 1, 16, 156110) I will be satisfied if I am not slack in my effort.
('50', 97, 1, 17, 156162) I realized that my eagerness to learn the Gita verses by heart while spinning was a sign of my slackness.
('50', 97, 1, 18, 156268) That was against the teaching of the Gita.
('50', 97, 1, 19, 156311) I wish to memorize the Gita verses if I can do that and at the same time acquire proficiency in spinning, but I would be false to the teaching of the Gita as I understand it if I tried to learn its verses by heart at the cost of my spinning.
('50', 97, 1, 20, 156553) Plead with Amidas.
('50', 97, 1, 21, 156572) I am writing to him.
('50', 97, 1, 22, 156593) How can we ask a person like him to leave the Ashram?
('50', 97, 1, 23, 156647) I shall not be able to send two discourses.
('50', 97, 1, 24, 156691) Perhaps I will continue the discourse on equality of religions.
('50', 97, 1, 25, 156755) I feel inclined to omit the subject of swadeshi.
('50', 97, 1, 26, 156804) I feel that by writing on it I may violate to some extent my resolution to make no reference to political subjects.
('50', 97, 1, 27, 156920) Even if I write about swadeshi from a spiritual standpoint, I am bound to include in the discourse something which would have an indirect connection with politics.
('50', 97, 1, 28, 157084) If I feel that I can write on the subject without touching on politics, I will try.
('50', 97, 1, 29, 157168) Let me see if I can do so.
('50', 97, 1, 30, 157195) There is no point in forcing Giriraj to stay there against his wishes.
('50', 97, 1, 31, 157266) If Balkrishna invites him to go to Wardha, what harm do you see in his going?
('50', 97, 1, 32, 157344) He is a good man, but he cannot think clearly.
('50', 97, 1, 33, 157391) Balkrishnas company is likely to benefit him.
('50', 97, 1, 34, 157437) Since you have written to Vinoba offering to send more persons, why not Giriraj?
('50', 97, 1, 35, 157518) If he feels happy, he will certainly work.
('50', 97, 1, 36, 157561) It does not seem right to me to abandon him.
('50', 97, 1, 37, 157606) But, I again seem to be meddling with what I should leave alone.
('50', 97, 1, 38, 157671) Dont, therefore, attach much weight to what I have said.
('50', 97, 1, 39, 157728) Treat this merely as a suggestion intended to help you to come to a decision.
('50', 97, 1, 40, 157806) It is possible that I may have formed my opinion without knowing all
('50', 98, 0, 1, 157875) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 99
('50', 98, 1, 2, 157918) the facts of the case.
('50', 98, 1, 3, 157941) I have so much confidence in your decisions that, when my reason does not accept any of them, I feel that that must be so because of my ignorance of some facts.
('50', 98, 1, 4, 158102) And now I reply to your questions: 1. There is no question of asking him to leave the Ashram, but I would not ask him to stay on either if he decided to leave.
('50', 98, 1, 5, 158262) 2. He should not go to Wardha without the consent of the Ashram authorities.
('50', 98, 1, 6, 158339) 3. If he does anything against the wishes of the Ashram authorities and forfeits their confidence, the Ashram cannot support his children.
('50', 98, 1, 7, 158478) 4. If the Ashram is not in a position to look after Katu and Vimu, I cannot think where we can send them.
('50', 98, 1, 8, 158584) If at present Giriraj has no share in looking after them, the Ashram may, if it can, look after them in case he goes to some other place with the consent of the Ashram authorities.
('50', 98, 1, 9, 158765) If, however, the children have become unmanageable, Giriraj should be told so.
('50', 98, 1, 10, 158844) 5. I think the Ashram should give Giriraj the necessary financial help to enable him to make some other arran gement.
('50', 98, 1, 11, 158962) The amount of such help should be fixed by the Ashram.
('50', 98, 1, 12, 159017) I think I have now replied to all your questions.
('50', 98, 1, 13, 159067) Read my letter to Giriraj.
('50', 98, 1, 14, 159094) I do not have the necessary data to enable me to decide about Manibehn.
('50', 98, 1, 15, 159166) But from what I have understood I feel that she should be permitted to go to her place if she is very keen on doing so.
('50', 98, 1, 16, 159286) It is a question not of what Bhagwanji wishes, but of what Manibehn wishes.
('50', 98, 1, 17, 159362) If she wants to stay on, she should be welcome to do so, on this condition, however, that she should forget Bhagwanji.
('50', 98, 1, 18, 159481) She should not wish or hope to see him.
('50', 98, 1, 19, 159521) She should submit to the Ashram rules as the other women do.
('50', 98, 1, 20, 159582) If she is not willing to do this, she should leave.
('50', 98, 1, 21, 159634) I understand what you say about Mirabehn and Kumarappa.
('50', 98, 1, 22, 159690) Your decision seems right.
('50', 98, 1, 23, 159717) I am writing to Mirabehn.
('50', 98, 1, 24, 159743) Where is Jethalal at present?
('50', 98, 1, 25, 159773) The names of the fruits which you said would be on display in our exhibition gave me a pleasant surprise.
('50', 98, 1, 26, 159879) I didnt even know that you had planted grapes.
('50', 98, 1, 27, 159926) You need not send my worn sandals.
('50', 98, 1, 28, 159961) There was a new pair.
('50', 98, 1, 29, 159983) If Kanti does not know about it, that is the end of the matter.
('50', 98, 1, 30, 160047) As I told
('50', 99, 0, 1, 160057) 100 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 99, 1, 2, 160099) you in my letter, I have been able to manage for the present.
('50', 99, 1, 3, 160161) We shall see later what we should do if you do not succeed in finding the new pair.
('50', 99, 1, 4, 160245) Why shouldnt a pair from the stock of sandals in the Ashram do for me?
('50', 99, 1, 5, 160316) A pair like the one you sent for Kakasaheb will be all right for me.
('50', 99, 1, 6, 160385) I would like the sandals better without the dalia such as Kakasahebs pair has.
('50', 99, 1, 7, 160464) Do send the money for Pyarelals living expenses.
('50', 99, 1, 8, 160513) You can adopt no other course in his case.
('50', 99, 1, 9, 160556) He ought to have drawn money even earlier, which he did not do.
('50', 99, 1, 10, 160620) The Ashram is all that he has in the world, call it his friend or anything you will.
('50', 99, 1, 11, 160705) What you have done about Gokibehn is worthy of you.
('50', 99, 1, 12, 160757) Of course, nothing could have been sent to her from the Ashram.
('50', 99, 1, 13, 160821) You could have approached Dr. Mehta, but I liked it very much that you gave the sum from your own resources.
('50', 99, 1, 14, 160930) I am sure she needed it.
('50', 99, 1, 15, 160955) I went through the figures of spinning on Rentia Barash 1. They are very good indeed.
('50', 99, 1, 16, 161041) I think Khurshedbehn wants some more women.
('50', 99, 1, 17, 161085) Find out exactly what she wants and send someone if you can.
('50', 99, 1, 18, 161146) If you cannot, give her convincing reasons why you cannot.
('50', 99, 1, 19, 161205) As far as I can see, no mature woman worker is now left there who can go and join her.
('50', 99, 2, 20, 161292) September 26, 1930
('50', 99, 3, 21, 161311) I was weighed today.
('50', 99, 3, 22, 161332) The weight is a little above 103, which means that there has been some improvement.
('50', 99, 3, 23, 161416) Kakasaheb weighed a little below 115. That means that there has been no improvement during the past week.
('50', 99, 3, 24, 161522) It may not be unusual for him to lose half a pound or a quarter of a pound occasionally.
('50', 99, 3, 25, 161611) You did the right thing in not sending me B. J.s leaflet.
('50', 99, 3, 26, 161669) You cannot send it.
('50', 99, 4, 27, 161689) September 27, 1930
('50', 99, 5, 28, 161708) Lilavati has again become impatient to go and join Khurshedbehn.
('50', 99, 5, 29, 161773) If the latter knows her condition and still calls her, I think it may be best to let her go.
('50', 99, 5, 30, 161866) Rather than that she should remain in the Ashram and feel restless, it is better that she should go and return wiser from experience.
('50', 99, 5, 31, 162000) Do what you think best.
('50', 99, 5, 32, 162024) Satis Babu had made a balance costing 3 annas for weighing slivers, etc.; if you can find that or any other similar balance, send it with someone who may

('50', 100, 1, 3, 162345) Do you have any news about Anna who was spreading Hindi in Madras?
('50', 100, 1, 4, 162412) September 28, 1930 Did you get the yarn which Kakasaheb had sent through Bal for the Goseva Sangh?
('50', 100, 1, 5, 162511) He had sent, through Shankar, 8,500 yardsfor the Charkha Sangh.
('50', 100, 1, 6, 162575) Will it be delivered to you there or will it be delivered at Ahmedabad?
('50', 100, 1, 7, 162647) Read what I have written about Miss A. in my letter to Mirabehn.
('50', 100, 1, 8, 162712) Tuesday morning, September 30, 1930
('50', 100, 2, 9, 162748) As I told you in my letter last week, I have translated into English the discourse on Equality of Religions and send the translation herewith.
('50', 100, 2, 10, 162891) If Valjibhai has translated it and if his translation has already been printed, he should read the translation which I am sending.
('50', 100, 2, 11, 163022) Anybody else who wishes to read it may do so and the last person should hand it over to Mirabehn.
('50', 100, 2, 12, 163120) If Valjibhais translation has not been printed, he should carefully go through my translation and then publish whichever he likes.
('50', 100, 2, 13, 163251) Do you intend to publish the discourses in Gujarati only or their English translations also?
('50', 100, 2, 14, 163344) This subject is so important that I dwell a little further on it.
('50', 100, 2, 15, 163410) My meaning will perhaps become clearer if I describe here some of my experiences.
('50', 100, 2, 16, 163492) In Phoenix we had our daily prayers in the same way as in Sabarmati, and Mussalmans as well as Christians attended them along with Hindus.
('50', 100, 2, 17, 163631) The late Sheth Rustomji and his children too attended the prayer meetings.
('50', 100, 2, 18, 163706) Rustomji Sheth very much liked the Gujarati bhajan.
('50', 100, 2, 19, 163758) Dear, dear to me is the name of Rama. If my memory serves me right, Maganlal or Kashi was once leading us in singing this hymn, when Rustomji Sheth exclaimed joyously Say the name of Hormazd instead of the name of Rama.
('50', 100, 2, 20, 163978) His suggestion was readily taken up, and after that whenever the Sheth was present, and sometimes even when he was not, we put in the name of Hormazd in place of Rama.
('50', 100, 2, 21, 164146) The late Husain, son of Daud Sheth, often stayed at the Phoenix Ashram, and enthusiastically joined our prayers.
('50', 100, 2, 22, 164259) To the accompaniment of an organ, he used to sing in a very sweet voice the song Hai bahare bagh, The garden of this world has only a momentary bloom.
('50', 100, 2, 23, 164410) He taught us all this song, which we also sang at prayers.
('50', 100, 2, 24, 164469) Its inclusion in our Bhajanavali is a tribute to truth loving Husains memory.
('50', 100, 2, 25, 164547) I have never met a young man who practised Truth more devotedly than Husain.
('50', 100, 2, 26, 164624) Joseph Royeppen often came to Phoenix.
('50', 100, 2, 27, 164663) He was a Christian, and his favourite hymn was Vaishnava
('50', 101, 0, 1, 164720) 102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 101, 1, 2, 164762) He loved music and once sang this hymn saying Christian in place of vaishnava.
('50', 101, 1, 3, 164841) The others accepted his reading with alacrity, and I observed that this filled Josephs heart with joy.
('50', 101, 1, 4, 164944) When I was turning over the pages of the sacred books of different faiths for my own satisfaction, I became sufficiently familiar for my purpose with Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Judaismand Hinduism.
('50', 101, 1, 5, 165152) In reading these texts, I can say that I felt the same regard for all these faiths although, perhaps, I was not then conscious of it.
('50', 101, 1, 6, 165286) Reviving my memory of those days, I do not find I ever had the slightest desire to criticize any of those religions merely because they were not my own, but read each sacred book in a spirit of reverence and found the same fundamental morality in each.
('50', 101, 1, 7, 165539) Some things I did not understand then, as I did not in Hindu scriptures.
('50', 101, 1, 8, 165612) I do not understand those things even now, but experience has taught me that it is a mistake hastily to imagine that anything that we cannot understand is necessarily wrong.
('50', 101, 1, 9, 165786) Some things which I did not understand first have since become as clear as daylight.
('50', 101, 1, 10, 165871) Equimin dedness helps us to solve many difficulties and even when we criticize anything, we express ourselves with a humility and courtesy which leave no sting behind them.
('50', 101, 1, 11, 166044) One difficulty still remains.
('50', 101, 1, 12, 166074) As I stated last time, the acceptance of the doctrine of Equality of Religions does not abolish the distinction between religion and irreligion.
('50', 101, 1, 13, 166219) We do not propose to cultivate tolerance for irreligion.
('50', 101, 1, 14, 166276) That being so, some people might object that there would be no room left for equimindedness, if everyone took his own decision as to what was religion and what was irreligion.
('50', 101, 1, 15, 166452) Such a question may be raised and one may even make a mistake in deciding what is religion and what is irreligion.
('50', 101, 1, 16, 166567) If, however, we follow the law of love, we shall not bear any hatred towards the irreligious brother.
('50', 101, 1, 17, 166669) On the contrary, though we see that he follows irreligion, we shall love him and, therefore, either we shall bring him to see the error of his ways or he will convince us of our error, or each will tolerate the others difference of opinion.
('50', 101, 1, 18, 166910) If the other party does not observe the law of love, he may be violent to us.
('50', 101, 1, 19, 166988) If, however, we cherish real love for him, it will overcome his bitterness in the end.
('50', 101, 1, 20, 167075) All obstacles in our path will vanish, if only we observe the golden rule that we must not be impatient with those whom we may consider to be in error, but must be prepared, if need be, to suffer in our own person.

('50', 102, 1, 2, 167334) As I have stated earlier in this letter, I think I will omit the subject of swadeshi.

('50', 102, 5, 7, 167595) October 2, 1930
('50', 102, 6, 8, 167611) DEAR MAJOR MARTIN, Mr. Quinn has been having a chat with me about my letter of 30th ultimo.
('50', 102, 6, 9, 167703) If you are authorized to let me see periodically in the yard where I am kept, those of my friends whom I may find it necessary to see for the sake of service, I should be quite satisfied.
('50', 102, 6, 10, 167891) Of course, I would not discuss politics with them nor send any political message, nor say or suggest anything calculated to subvert prison discipline.
('50', 102, 6, 11, 168042) As I told you this morning, my object in wanting to see these friends is to serve them and, if you would believe it, assist the jail authorities wherever it may be possible even as I did in 1923.

('50', 103, 1, 2, 168688) 151. LETTER TO PREMABEHN KANTAK
('50', 103, 2, 3, 168720) YERAVDA MANDIR, October 2, 1930
('50', 103, 3, 4, 168752) PREMA, If you wish, you may certainly keep the wooden sandals.
('50', 103, 3, 5, 168815) But what will you do with those bits of wood?
('50', 103, 3, 6, 168861) Keep them if you think that they will add an inch or two to your stature.
('50', 103, 3, 7, 168935) I would condemn your action as smacking of idolatry.
('50', 103, 3, 8, 168988) I used to keep with me a photograph of my father.
('50', 103, 3, 9, 169038) I had hung his photographs in the drawing room and the bedroom when I was in South Africa.
('50', 103, 3, 10, 169129) When I used to wear a chain, it had a locket which contained small photographs of my father and elder brother.
('50', 103, 3, 11, 169240) I have now put them away.
('50', 103, 3, 12, 169266) That does not mean that I feel less reverence for them now.
('50', 103, 3, 13, 169326) In fact they are more deeply engraved in my heart today.
('50', 103, 3, 14, 169383) I think of their virtues and try to cultivate them.
('50', 103, 3, 15, 169435) I can worship countless gods in this manner.
('50', 103, 3, 16, 169480) If I tried to keep with me photographs of them all, I would have no room to put them in.
('50', 103, 3, 17, 169569) And if I tried to keep their wooden sandals, I should have to acquire a piece of land for the purpose.
('50', 103, 3, 18, 169672) As a man of experience, I advise you, therefore, to follow me when I am walking on the right path.
('50', 103, 3, 19, 169771) That will be a thousand times better than keeping my wooden sandals, and if anybody follows your example, I would welcome that.
('50', 103, 3, 20, 169899) On the contrary, if anybody saw the sandals with you and followed your example blindly, would he not fall into a pit?
('50', 103, 3, 21, 170017) Think on this and then do what you wish.
('50', 103, 3, 22, 170058) He who understands and does his duty, his cravings have already left him.
('50', 103, 3, 23, 170132) A person whose cravings have not left him has no sense of duty.
('50', 103, 3, 24, 170196) Our cravings are like a huge mountain which no man can cross over by climbing.
('50', 103, 3, 25, 170275) The only course for us is to raze the mountain to the ground.
('50', 103, 3, 26, 170337) To give up our cravings is to become conscious of our duty.
('50', 103, 3, 27, 170397) Suppose that I wish to go to Kashi.
('50', 103, 3, 28, 170433) I even know the path which I should follow to reach it.
('50', 103, 3, 29, 170489) What other craving, then, will force me to stray from that path?
('50', 103, 3, 30, 170554) I have no other craving but to reach Kashi, and that is satisfied.
('50', 103, 3, 31, 170621) What more do I want then?
('50', 103, 3, 32, 170647) You have an opportunity for service which has come to you unsought.
('50', 103, 3, 33, 170715) You should get fullest satisfaction in doing that service with single minded devotion.
('50', 103, 3, 34, 170802) Whatever opportunitiesfor human company and for reading you get while doing that duty, may
('50', 104, 0, 1, 170893) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 105
('50', 104, 1, 2, 170937) be availed of.
('50', 104, 1, 3, 170952) Apart from that, you should desire nothing.
('50', 104, 1, 4, 170996) This, according to me is yoga, skill in works, equimindedness and samadhi.
('50', 104, 1, 5, 171071) If, however, all this seems idle preaching to you and you thirst for reading, by all means satisfy your craving.
('50', 104, 1, 6, 171184) Reduce the burden of work on you and take rest.
('50', 104, 1, 7, 171232) How you may do this, you can decide only in consultation with Narandas.
('50', 104, 1, 8, 171304) He is a man of profound understanding, patience and goodness.
('50', 104, 1, 9, 171366) He will certainly help you.
('50', 104, 1, 10, 171394) What more can I say to cheer you?
('50', 104, 1, 11, 171428) A person like me can only suggest the direction which you should follow.
('50', 104, 1, 12, 171501) It is on oneself, however, that you and everyone else should depend for peace of mind.
('50', 104, 1, 13, 171588) I understand what you say about Sushila.
('50', 104, 1, 14, 171629) In future, let her send her good wishes in Marathi.
('50', 104, 1, 15, 171681) My blessings to her.
('50', 104, 1, 16, 171702) I understand that after having enjoyed Panditjis music, a person like you will not enjoy music by anybody else.
('50', 104, 1, 17, 171814) But why should you not, yourself, lead the bhajans?
('50', 104, 1, 18, 171866) If you have the courage to do so, ask them to let you do it.
('50', 104, 1, 19, 171927) If you wish, I will write.
('50', 104, 1, 20, 171954) You certainly know how to sing.
('50', 104, 1, 21, 171986) I have not forgotten that you used to sing bhajans almost every night.
('50', 104, 1, 22, 172057) How are your tonsils?
('50', 104, 1, 23, 172079) Did you get them examined by Dr. Haribhai?

('50', 104, 6, 29, 172362) The work of service will never end.
('50', 104, 6, 30, 172398) If you become stronger, you will be able to work better.
('50', 104, 6, 31, 172455) Moreover, our programme is such that wherever we are, we can do some work.

('50', 105, 2, 3, 172691) YERAVDA MANDIR, October 2, 1930
('50', 105, 3, 4, 172723) GANGABEHN (SENIOR), I have your letter.
('50', 105, 3, 5, 172763) If you think you are not worthy of being a daughter, how much more fit should I become to be a worthy mother and father to you?
('50', 105, 3, 6, 172891) If I who claim to be both, am slack in my effort to be so, I shall have no place anywhere in the three worlds.
('50', 105, 3, 7, 173002) Let us, therefore, not argue who is worthy and who is not.
('50', 105, 3, 8, 173061) If a son or daughter is unworthy, the parents bear no small responsibility for that.
('50', 105, 3, 9, 173146) I understand the reason for your depression.
('50', 105, 3, 10, 173191) Instead of thinking that you have to do this, that or the other thing, you should think that God does all that and uses you as His instrument.
('50', 105, 3, 11, 173334) If you think thus, you will feel no burden at all.
('50', 105, 3, 12, 173385) It is God who carries the burden, and His shoulders are so broad that however heavy the burden we place on them He does not feel it even as much as we would a speck of dust on our hand.
('50', 105, 3, 13, 173571) We should, therefore, forget I and Mine.
('50', 105, 3, 14, 173612) It is I who do this that is our ignorance, like that of the dog who thinks he draws the cart: this line by Narasinh Mehta expresses his own experience.
('50', 105, 3, 15, 173764) Shakat in this line means a cart.
('50', 105, 3, 16, 173798) If we believe that the dog who walks under a moving cart draws it, then we may believe that the burden of our tasks is on us; but anyone who works for the love of God will never find his task a heavier burden than he can carry.
('50', 105, 3, 17, 174026) He does not have to take upon himself anything.
('50', 105, 3, 18, 174074) Tasks come to him unsought.
('50', 105, 3, 19, 174102) He goes on working cheerfully, with Gods name upon his lips.
('50', 105, 3, 20, 174163) You sing with sincere emotion: Make me your servant. Think over the meaning of that bhajan.
('50', 105, 3, 21, 174255) Also think over the meaning of the two verses which we have added to the prayers for women.
('50', 105, 3, 22, 174347) It is the Lords assurance to those who surrender themselves to Him that He will carry the burden of their happiness and welfare.
('50', 105, 3, 23, 174476) Why, then, should we worry?
('50', 105, 3, 24, 174504) This is looking at the matter philosophically.
('50', 105, 3, 25, 174551) But even if you and I feel agitated, what escape is there for us?
('50', 105, 3, 26, 174617) Our relationship with the Ashram is like the Hindu marriage bond.
('50', 105, 3, 27, 174683) The tie can never be loosened.
('50', 105, 3, 28, 174714) Instead of thinking whetherothers are half hearted or firm in their attitude, you should ask
('50', 106, 0, 1, 174807) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 107
('50', 106, 1, 2, 174851) yourself whether you are half hearted or firm, and that is all that is necessary.
('50', 106, 1, 3, 174933) Certainly seek what comfort Nath can give you.
('50', 106, 1, 4, 174980) Talk with Narandas and pour out your heart every week to me.
('50', 106, 1, 5, 175041) If you can free yourself for a few days and pay a visit to Kakasaheb, that, too, will give you some comfort.
('50', 106, 1, 6, 175150) Do not work so hard that you get exhausted.
('50', 106, 1, 7, 175194) One should always preserve a sense of proportion in undertaking work in the spirit of service.
('50', 106, 1, 8, 175289) We can do that only if we have cultivated the attitude of non attachment.
('50', 106, 1, 9, 175363) Non attachment means freedom from the sense of I and Mine.
('50', 106, 1, 10, 175422) The saying that while sleeping one should stretch out ones limbs according to the length of the covering has great wisdom behind it.
('50', 106, 1, 11, 175555) Read this letter again and again, think over it and overcome your depression and put your heart in the bhajan when you sing Make me your servant.

('50', 106, 5, 17, 175888) BHAI BALVIR SINGH, Your letter.
('50', 106, 5, 18, 175920) The work at Khadi Bhandar constitutes not only proper work but also excellent work.
('50', 106, 5, 19, 176004) Performance of yajna implies spinning for half an hour at least.
('50', 106, 5, 20, 176069) These jobs cannot be evaluated on a comparative basis as both are part of your duty.
('50', 106, 5, 21, 176154) Hence you have to find time for spinning just as you have to find time for meals.
('50', 106, 5, 22, 176236) It takes only one day to prepare enough slivers to last for a month.
('50', 106, 5, 23, 176305) Fewer slivers will be required if you spin to the fineness of 20 or 30 instead of 10. Talk it over with Mahavirprasadji.
('50', 106, 5, 24, 176426) Kakasaheb sends you his blessings.

('50', 107, 3, 4, 176653) DEAR MAJOR MARTIN, With reference to our conversations, by friends I mean those civil resistance prisoners whom I know.
('50', 107, 3, 5, 176773) I should want to meet only those who may be reported to be suffering from illness or ill treatment or might have been reported to have so suffered.
('50', 107, 3, 6, 176921) This right too, I should exercise with as much restraint as possible.
('50', 107, 3, 7, 176991) If it is necessary to explain my meaning further, you will please let me know.
('50', 107, 3, 8, 177070) I want to have no mental reservations.
('50', 107, 3, 9, 177109) As for postponing the enforcement of my resolution, I am sorry I must not do it, if satisfaction cannot be had in time.
('50', 107, 3, 10, 177229) But it need cause no immediate worry as in the initial stages, I should be eating such ordinary convict food as I can religiously take.

('50', 108, 4, 6, 177930) Do as Shankerlalji says.
('50', 108, 4, 7, 177955) You must go on with your task despite the worlds ridicule.
('50', 108, 4, 8, 178014) Do not picket the dealers in mill made slivers, but persuade them with love.
('50', 108, 4, 9, 178091) On no account give up truth and non violence.
('50', 108, 4, 10, 178137) You will then automatically acquire mental strength.

('50', 108, 10, 17, 178352) I have your letter.
('50', 108, 10, 18, 178372) What you write about weavers is true.
('50', 108, 10, 19, 178410) There is a special class of workers in Ahmedabad who starch yarn.
('50', 108, 10, 20, 178476) We see such workers elsewhere too.
('50', 108, 10, 21, 178511) Cannot we supply starched warp to weavers?
('50', 108, 10, 22, 178554) If you ask Ramjibhai and the others, they also will come and help.
('50', 108, 10, 23, 178621) They will have to do the work entrusted to them by Chhaganbhai or Surendra.
('50', 108, 10, 24, 178697) If, however, you feel that I should write to them, write to me again.

('50', 109, 7, 12, 179317) YERAVDA MANDIR, October 5, 1930
('50', 109, 8, 13, 179349) MIRA, I am writing this after taking silence.
('50', 109, 8, 14, 179395) Have just seen your portrait in a group published in the Times Illustrated Weekly.
('50', 109, 8, 15, 179478) You are spinning on the takli and looking fit.
('50', 109, 8, 16, 179525) Then I saw in the columns of The Bombay Chronicle that you were in the womens procession and spoke at their meeting.
('50', 109, 8, 17, 179642) So you are again near my lodgings and probably this will be in your hands at the Ashram.
('50', 109, 8, 18, 179731) Yes, S. Aiengars daughter is a very good woman but she was hysterical even when we were travelling from Mysore.
('50', 109, 8, 19, 179843) When you write to her please give my love to her and tell her I often think of her.
('50', 109, 8, 20, 179927) It is a sad thingher fathers case.
('50', 109, 8, 21, 179962) It is the same thing with him as with the daughter.
('50', 109, 8, 22, 180014) He can be hardly considered responsible for many of his strange acts.
('50', 109, 8, 23, 180084) Did you see him at all?
('50', 109, 8, 24, 180108) Where did you stay whilst in Madras?
('50', 109, 8, 25, 180145) Last week, Kaka having been given my wheel, I thought I would finish my quota on yours.
('50', 109, 8, 26, 180233) I tried hard but I could not make it work.
('50', 109, 8, 27, 180276) The spindle wont turn.
('50', 109, 8, 28, 180299) Whether the resin was ineffective or what the cause was, I could not divine.
('50', 109, 8, 29, 180376) But there it was refusing to turn.
('50', 109, 8, 30, 180411) Then I thought of the Gandiv of Surat.
('50', 109, 8, 31, 180450) I found it to be an extraordinarily effective thing.
('50', 109, 8, 32, 180503) For the last two days I have been finishing the whole
('50', 110, 0, 1, 180557) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 111
('50', 110, 1, 2, 180601) of my quota on it and that in very good time and without the slighest fatigue.
('50', 110, 1, 3, 180680) It has captivated me and I want you to try it.
('50', 110, 1, 4, 180727) It is essentially a poor mans wheel.
('50', 110, 1, 5, 180764) The inventor is no mechanic.
('50', 110, 1, 6, 180793) How it has come to him, I do not know.
('50', 110, 1, 7, 180832) But every part of it, in my opinion, shows solicitude for the starving.
('50', 110, 1, 8, 180904) It costs Rs. 1 1/2 but it can be made for only 8 annas, I am sure.
('50', 110, 1, 9, 180971) It is the lightest wheel going in India.
('50', 110, 1, 10, 181012) It requires the least attention.
('50', 110, 1, 11, 181045) It occupies the smallest space of all the wheels I know.
('50', 110, 1, 12, 181102) A little child can work at it.
('50', 110, 1, 13, 181133) Thousands of these wheels can be manufactured in a day if the discs and spindles are kept in stock.
('50', 110, 1, 14, 181233) Its mechanism is simplicity personified.
('50', 110, 1, 15, 181274) You naturally draw a fine thread.
('50', 110, 1, 16, 181308) The very first I drew was over 30 counts.
('50', 110, 1, 17, 181350) And I fancy that it can compete with any in giving speed.
('50', 110, 1, 18, 181408) It admits of certain improvements, which can be made without adding a pice to the cost.
('50', 110, 1, 19, 181496) I have made two and this reduces the cost.
('50', 110, 1, 20, 181539) The original has noisy wooden holders.
('50', 110, 1, 21, 181578) I have discarded them and put on coir rope picked up from rubbish.
('50', 110, 1, 22, 181645) I have broken up the jingling glass bars on the spindle and wound a few turns of yarn to hold the spindle in position.
('50', 110, 1, 23, 181764) This has made it absolutely noiseless.
('50', 110, 1, 24, 181803) Such is the opinion of a new convert, who has tried it only for the last four days.
('50', 110, 1, 25, 181887) It may, therefore, need modification.
('50', 110, 1, 26, 181925) But it is undoubtedly a case for believers to give it a fair trial.
('50', 110, 1, 27, 181993) I am writing to the inventor suggesting certain improvements and am writing to Keshu too to examine, try and if my preliminary observation is at all sound, to improve it.
('50', 110, 1, 28, 182164) There are other merits I must not describe, as I have many more letters yet to write.
('50', 110, 1, 29, 182250) If you can think of the reason that has prevented the spindle on your wheel from turning, please tell me.
('50', 110, 1, 30, 182356) How did you find Brajkishore Babu?
('50', 110, 1, 31, 182391) Is he better?
('50', 110, 1, 32, 182405) Did you see Prabhavati?
('50', 110, 1, 33, 182429) She is much reduced and her latest letter says she had high fever.
('50', 110, 1, 34, 182496) And your health?
('50', 110, 1, 35, 182513) You must not break down at the Ashram.
('50', 110, 1, 36, 182552) You will have met Kamalabehn Lundy.
('50', 110, 1, 37, 182588) Of course you will befriend her.
('50', 110, 1, 38, 182621) She appears to be a very good woman.
('50', 110, 1, 39, 182658) Both of us are keeping excellent health.
('50', 110, 1, 40, 182699) My weight, if anything, shows a slight increase.
('50', 110, 1, 41, 182748) The vegetable experiment seems to have proved a success and it gives me joy to know that the disappearance of even dried fruit reduces the cost very materially.
('50', 110, 1, 42, 182909) In vegetables, for the last two days, I have been taking spinach which has moved the bowels automatically.
('50', 110, 1, 43, 183016) I take sweet potatoes off and on.
('50', 110, 1, 44, 183050) I hope you have by now got all my letters.

('50', 111, 3, 8, 183501) You may not accept furniture that you do not need from Father but you should ask him to send you something that it will please him to send you and that you may need.

('50', 113, 1, 4, 185592) Since you are in Patna, you can give me news about everyone there.

('50', 113, 6, 11, 185852) SHANTA (PATEL), I have your letter.
('50', 113, 6, 12, 185888) You have given much information, but the handwriting has not yet improved.
('50', 113, 6, 13, 185963) If you make an effort to improve it, you will certainly succeed.
('50', 113, 6, 14, 186028) If you dont improve it at this age, it will for ever remain bad, as mine has remained.
('50', 113, 6, 15, 186115) I hope you do understand that we commit violence in writing to anyone in a bad hand.

('50', 114, 2, 3, 186667) October 6, 1930
('50', 114, 3, 4, 186683) BHAGWANJI, I have gone through your letters.
('50', 114, 3, 5, 186728) Your opinion is not likely to be free from faults because it is in your nature to suspect rather too much.
('50', 114, 3, 6, 186835) Your duty just the same is to guard your own self.
('50', 114, 3, 7, 186886) Your duty is to keep quiet after having promptly informed Narandas about whatever evil you happen to notice.
('50', 114, 3, 8, 186995) Only in this way will you be able to make some progress.
('50', 114, 3, 9, 187052) Do not regard the Ashram as forsaken so long as there is even a single votary of the vows of truth, etc.

('50', 114, 7, 13, 187286) October 2/7, 1930
('50', 114, 8, 14, 187304) NARANDAS,
('50', 114, 9, 15, 187314) I got the Ashram packet yesterday.
('50', 114, 9, 16, 187349) Mostly the packets are handed over to me on the very day on which they arrive.
('50', 114, 9, 17, 187428) Read the letter which I am writing to Harilal Desai.
('50', 114, 9, 18, 187481) I have nothing to write about Giriraj this time.
('50', 114, 9, 19, 187530) Do what you think best.
('50', 114, 9, 20, 187554) I was glad to read about Zainu.
('50', 114, 9, 21, 187586) I am writing to Bhagwanji.
('50', 114, 9, 22, 187613) His letter will have no effect on me.
('50', 114, 9, 23, 187651) I know his nature.
('50', 114, 9, 24, 187670) I felt after reading Madhus letter that she was a very innocent girl.
('50', 114, 9, 25, 187740) I am sure Navin and others will learn simplicity by and by.
('50', 114, 9, 26, 187800) I am happy that you trust others.
('50', 114, 9, 27, 187834) No one who does so has ever lost anything in the world.
('50', 114, 9, 28, 187890) The suspicious gain nothing; on the contrary, they often lose something and exchange worry for peace of mind.
('50', 114, 9, 29, 188000) Take care about three things in regard to all who have got malaria.
('50', 114, 9, 30, 188068) They should see to it that they clear their bowels.
('50', 114, 9, 31, 188120) If they do not do that in the natural course, they should take either a purgative or an enema.
('50', 114, 9, 32, 188215) Even after the fever has come down, they should take 5 grains of quinine daily for a week, dissolvingthe quinine in lime juice and adding 10 to 15 grains of soda bicarb to the mixture, drinking it as they would soda water.
('50', 114, 9, 33, 188438) There will be, and
('50', 115, 0, 1, 188457) 116 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 115, 1, 2, 188499) ought to be, effervescence, when the mixture is prepared.
('50', 115, 1, 3, 188557) Further, for at least one week after the fever has gone they should live on milk and black dried grapes or boiled vegetables.
('50', 115, 1, 4, 188683) Those who have had no attack of malaria should, if they sleep where there are mosquitoes, rub kerosene over the exposed parts of the body before going to bed.
('50', 115, 1, 5, 188842) In any case everyone should keep his stomach light.
('50', 115, 1, 6, 188894) Amidas does cause me worry.
('50', 115, 1, 7, 188922) I should be happy if my letter has had any effect and he has started taking milk.
('50', 115, 1, 8, 189004) Punjabhai may follow his inclinations and live as he wishes.
('50', 115, 1, 9, 189065) If Jamna is treated by the Udasi Vaid who treats Chandrashankar, she may also benefit.
('50', 115, 1, 10, 189152) Chandrashankar is all praise for him.
('50', 115, 1, 11, 189190) Go and see him once.
('50', 115, 1, 12, 189211) Read my letter to Gangabehn.
('50', 115, 1, 13, 189240) Give her some time and console her.
('50', 115, 1, 14, 189276) If she comes to Poona even on the excuse of visiting Kakasaheb, she will have change of air for three days.
('50', 115, 1, 15, 189384) Keep urging Nathji.
('50', 115, 1, 16, 189404) His presence, too, may give peace to Gangabehn.
('50', 115, 1, 17, 189452) Tell Mahadevs mother that you are glad she has come, and that she should not think of returning to Dihen in the immediate future.
('50', 115, 1, 18, 189582) If possible, she should stay on permanently in the Ashram.
('50', 115, 1, 19, 189641) Read my letter to Chhaganlal.
('50', 115, 1, 20, 189671) You will see from it what restraints should be observed by those who write to me.
('50', 115, 1, 21, 189753) If in any letter they are not observed, it should be kept back and not forwarded to me.
('50', 115, 1, 22, 189841) I think Khadag Bahadurs letter did not observe them.
('50', 115, 1, 23, 189894) Premabehn, too, seems worried.
('50', 115, 1, 24, 189925) Read the letter to her and console her.
('50', 115, 1, 25, 189965) Read my letter to Kamalabehn Lundi.
('50', 115, 1, 26, 190001) Some of her suggestions deserve to be welcomed.
('50', 115, 2, 27, 190049) October 4, 1930
('50', 115, 3, 28, 190065) Read my letter to Chhaganlal Joshi.
('50', 115, 3, 29, 190101) Everyone who writes to me should observe the restraints which I have mentioned in it.
('50', 115, 3, 30, 190187) Any letters which violate them should be kept back.
('50', 115, 3, 31, 190239) Khadag Bahadurs letter was of that type.
('50', 115, 3, 32, 190280) 1 I dont want to burden you with the responsibility of reading all letters.
('50', 115, 3, 33, 190356) But you may glance through a letter by anyone who is writing for the first time.
('50', 115, 3, 34, 190437) Letters by the women never contain anything objectionable.
('50', 115, 3, 35, 190496) You will, therefore, need to read only a few of them.
('50', 115, 3, 36, 190550) I certainly feel sometimes that I should put in a separate packet the letters which I write to people there.
('50', 115, 3, 37, 190659) Perhaps the task of redirecting the other letters is much too heavy a burden on you.
('50', 115, 3, 38, 190744) I cannot think what I should do to reduce it.
('50', 115, 3, 39, 190790) Since those letters are not such as I
('50', 115, 4, 40, 190828) 1 Repetition of the four preceding sentences seems to be inadvertent.
('50', 116, 0, 1, 190898) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 117
('50', 116, 1, 2, 190942) need not write, I continue to burden you with the task of redirecting them.
('50', 116, 1, 3, 191018) Read my letter to Harilal Desai, so that you may bear in mind the suggestion I have made in it.
('50', 116, 1, 4, 191114) I have recently started spinning on the Gandiv spinning wheel.
('50', 116, 1, 5, 191177) I like it.
('50', 116, 1, 6, 191188) I can spin on it with almost the same speed as on the portable spinning wheel.
('50', 116, 1, 7, 191267) I hope to increase the speed.
('50', 116, 1, 8, 191297) With a few improvements, this wheel can perhaps be made a perfect model.
('50', 116, 1, 9, 191370) Read what I have written about it in my letter to Ishwarlal Vimawala.
('50', 116, 1, 10, 191440) Read what I propose to write about it in my letter to Mirabehn too.
('50', 116, 1, 11, 191508) I should like someone in the Ashram to try it.
('50', 116, 1, 12, 191555) You, too, may examine it.
('50', 116, 1, 13, 191581) I have suggested to Ishwarlal that he should send two or three wheels.
('50', 116, 1, 14, 191652) I have seen quite a number of models, but at the moment I think that among them all this is the only one worth trial and examination.
('50', 116, 1, 15, 191786) I will write further about it after I have had more experience of it.
('50', 116, 2, 16, 191856) Tuesday morning, October 7, 1930
('50', 116, 3, 17, 191889) I got the cotton and the yarn belt.
('50', 116, 3, 18, 191925) The cotton was particularly welcome, as Vallabhbhai is being supplied with slivers from here.
('50', 116, 3, 19, 192019) I am awaiting the scale, but there is no urgency about it.
('50', 116, 3, 20, 192078) Humility cannot be an observance by itself.
('50', 116, 3, 21, 192122) For it does not lend itself to being deliberately practised.
('50', 116, 3, 22, 192183) It is, however, an indispensable test of ahimsa.
('50', 116, 3, 23, 192232) In one who has ahimsa in him it becomes part of his very nature.
('50', 116, 3, 24, 192297) A preliminary draft of the rules and regulations of the Satyagraha Ashram was circulated among friends, including the late Sir Gurudas Banerji.
('50', 116, 3, 25, 192441) He suggested that humility should be accorded a place among the observances.
('50', 116, 3, 26, 192518) This suggestion could not then be accepted for the reason that I have just mentioned.
('50', 116, 3, 27, 192604) But although humility is not one of the observances, it is certainly as essential as, and perhaps even more essential than any of them.
('50', 116, 3, 28, 192740) Only it has never come to anyone by practice.
('50', 116, 3, 29, 192786) Truth can be cultivated as well as Love.
('50', 116, 3, 30, 192827) But to cultivate humility is tantamount to cultivating hypocrisy.
('50', 116, 3, 31, 192893) Humility must not be here confounded with mere manners or etiquette.
('50', 116, 3, 32, 192962) One man will sometimes prostrate himself before another although his heart is full of bitterness against him.
('50', 116, 3, 33, 193072) This is not humility, but cunning.
('50', 116, 3, 34, 193107) A man may chant Ramanama or tell his beads all day long, and move in society like a sage; but if he is selfish at heart, he is not meek but only hypocritical.
('50', 116, 3, 35, 193266) A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility.
('50', 116, 3, 36, 193324) Truth and the like perhaps admit of
('50', 117, 0, 1, 193360) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 117, 1, 2, 193402) measurement, but not humility.
('50', 117, 1, 3, 193433) Inborn humility can never remain hidden, and yet the possessor is unaware of itsexistence.
('50', 117, 1, 4, 193524) The story of Vashishtha and Vishwamitra furnishes a very good case in point.
('50', 117, 1, 5, 193601) Humility should make the possessor realize that he is as nothing.
('50', 117, 1, 6, 193667) Directly we imagine ourselves to be something, there is egotism.
('50', 117, 1, 7, 193732) If a man who keeps observances is proud of keeping them, they will lose much, if not all, of their value.
('50', 117, 1, 8, 193838) And a man who is proud of his virtue often becomes a curse to society.
('50', 117, 1, 9, 193909) Society will not appreciate it, and he himself will fail to reap any benefit from it.
('50', 117, 1, 10, 193995) Even a little thought will suffice to convince us that all creatures are nothing more than a mere atom in this universe.
('50', 117, 1, 11, 194116) Our existence as embodied beings is purely momentary.
('50', 117, 1, 12, 194170) What are a hundred years in eternity?
('50', 117, 1, 13, 194208) But if we shatter the chains of egotism and melt into the ocean of humanity, we share its dignity.
('50', 117, 1, 14, 194307) To feel that we are something is to set up a barrier between God and ourselves; to cease feeling that we are something is to become one with God.
('50', 117, 1, 15, 194453) A drop in the ocean partakes of the greatness of its parent, although it is unconscious of it.
('50', 117, 1, 16, 194548) But it is dried up as soon as it enters upon an existence independent of the ocean.
('50', 117, 1, 17, 194632) We do not exaggerate when we say that life on earth is a mere bubble.
('50', 117, 1, 18, 194702) How is it possible to cultivate such utter humility?
('50', 117, 1, 19, 194755) It develops of itself if we understand the spirit of our observances.
('50', 117, 1, 20, 194825) Can one who aspires to follow truth ever be a proud man?
('50', 117, 1, 21, 194882) A life of service must be one of humility.
('50', 117, 1, 22, 194925) He who would sacrifice his life for others has hardly time to reserve for himself a place in the sun.
('50', 117, 1, 23, 195027) Inertia must not be mistaken for humility, as it has been in Hinduism.
('50', 117, 1, 24, 195098) Because it has been so mistaken, lethargy and hypocrisy have often flourished in its name.
('50', 117, 1, 25, 195189) True humility means most strenuous and constant endeavour entirely directed towards the service of humanity.
('50', 117, 1, 26, 195298) God is continuously in action without resting a single moment.
('50', 117, 1, 27, 195361) If we would serve Him or become one with Him, our activity must be as unwearied as His.
('50', 117, 1, 28, 195449) There may be momentary rest in store for the drop which is separated from the ocean, but not for the drop in the ocean, which knows no rest.
('50', 117, 1, 29, 195590) The same is the case with ourselves.
('50', 117, 1, 30, 195627) As soon as we become one with the ocean, in the shape of God, there is no more rest for us, nor indeed do we need rest any longer.
('50', 117, 1, 31, 195758) Our very sleep is action.
('50', 117, 1, 32, 195784) For we sleep with the thought of God in our hearts.
('50', 117, 1, 33, 195836) This restlessness constitutes true rest.
('50', 117, 1, 34, 195877) This never ceasing agitation holds the key to peace ineffable.
('50', 117, 1, 35, 195940) True humility, therefore, requires us to dedicate ourselves to the service of all living creatures.
('50', 117, 1, 36, 196040) When we have surrendered our all in this manner, no day in the week is a day of rest for us.
('50', 117, 1, 37, 196133) This supreme state of total
('50', 118, 0, 1, 196161) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 119
('50', 118, 1, 2, 196205) surrender is difficult to describe, but not beyond the bounds ofhuman experience.
('50', 118, 1, 3, 196287) It has been attained by many dedicated souls, and may be attained by ourselves as well.
('50', 118, 1, 4, 196375) This is the goal which we of the Satyagraha Ashram have set before ourselves; all our observances and activities are calculated to assist us in reaching it.
('50', 118, 1, 5, 196532) We shall reach it some day all unawares if we have truth in us.
('50', 118, 1, 6, 196596) It is unattainable if we consciously strive for it.
('50', 118, 2, 7, 196648) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] There are 61 letters today.
('50', 118, 2, 8, 196702) Some women from the Ashram should go and see Khurshedbehn.

('50', 118, 6, 13, 196917) KUSUM (DESAI),
('50', 118, 7, 14, 196932) I was able to see Pyarelal last week.
('50', 118, 7, 15, 196970) They had permitted very little time for the meeting.
('50', 118, 7, 16, 197023) He had certainly become weaker, but is better now.
('50', 118, 7, 17, 197074) He gets milk, etc.
('50', 118, 7, 18, 197093) He is well looked after.
('50', 118, 7, 19, 197118) I hope that I shall be able to see him several times again.

('50', 118, 11, 23, 197272) YERAVDA MANDIR, October 10, 1930
('50', 118, 12, 24, 197305) SHARDA (BABU), I have Your letter.
('50', 118, 12, 25, 197340) One reason why you do not like to spin is that you are not fully aware of the fact that through spinning you can serve millions, or, maybe you are not as much interested in serving them.
('50', 118, 12, 26, 197527) If that is the case you should correct your attitude.
('50', 119, 0, 1, 197581) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 119, 1, 2, 197623) Another reason may be that you have still not mastered the art of spinning.
('50', 119, 1, 3, 197699) Interest is bound to develop if you could spin fine yarn, the thread does not snap and the spinning wheel hums along without a jarring sound.
('50', 119, 1, 4, 197841) Have you ever seen the Andhra women spinning at an exhibition?
('50', 119, 1, 5, 197904) Who would not be interested in spinning if he could spin like them.
('50', 119, 1, 6, 197972) The same applies in the case of the Gita.
('50', 119, 1, 7, 198014) You will like it if you realize its worth.

('50', 119, 6, 13, 198249) My congratulations to Chandan.
('50', 119, 6, 14, 198280) You also should give your name for the competition.
('50', 119, 6, 15, 198332) If you get the prize, you may use the money for helping somebody.
('50', 119, 6, 16, 198398) Those who do not require any incentive such as a competition provides, should none the less join one for the sake of other people.
('50', 119, 6, 17, 198529) My blessings to Chandan, Tara and Vasant.

('50', 119, 11, 22, 198698) KAPIL, They got your letter at Vile Parle.
('50', 119, 11, 23, 198741) Although ones home may be near, one should not go there for the sake of the comforts one may get there or for the love of ones relations.
('50', 119, 11, 24, 198879) But there can be no objection to a worker going to his home to get proper nursing during illness, with the willing consent of his co workers and in order to lessen the burden on them.
('50', 119, 11, 25, 199063) It depends on ones attitude.

('50', 120, 1, 3, 199188) How can you let it become delicate at this young age?
('50', 120, 1, 4, 199242) Sun bath, pranayam 1, shavasan 2 and eating less help considerably in asthma.
('50', 120, 1, 5, 199320) Kakasaheb is quite well.

('50', 120, 7, 12, 199506) I have your letter.
('50', 120, 7, 13, 199526) I got the tomatoes, lemons and papayas sent by you and Nirmalabehn.
('50', 120, 7, 14, 199594) It irks me that you should spend the least bit of time or money on such things.
('50', 120, 7, 15, 199674) You have surely gone beyond the stage where you needed to give outward expression to your love.
('50', 120, 7, 16, 199770) One may incur such expense if it is necessaryhere it is not.
('50', 120, 7, 17, 199831) We both keep good health.
('50', 120, 7, 18, 199857) The exhibition seems to have gone off very well.

('50', 121, 3, 6, 200348) Learn well by heart the chapters of the Gita.

('50', 121, 8, 13, 200610) PANDITJI, I have your letter.
('50', 121, 8, 14, 200640) I hope your fever has completely left you.
('50', 121, 8, 15, 200683) I approve of your idea of reading the Ramayana among the village people and cultivating contacts with them by that means.
('50', 121, 8, 16, 200805) But do not let the opportunity for contacts with them be your motive for reading the Ramayana.
('50', 121, 8, 17, 200900) If you read the Ramayana among them, it should be only in order that they may learn wisdom.
('50', 121, 8, 18, 200992) If you incidentally get an opportunity of coming into contact with the villagers, that should of course be welcome.
('50', 121, 8, 19, 201108) That is, you should start reading the Ramayana with the intention of keeping up the practice.
('50', 121, 8, 20, 201202) Or you may read it occasionally as a means of cultivating contact with the people, as you do many other things for the same purpose; that would, then, be a different thing.
('50', 121, 8, 21, 201375) Understand the distinction between the two points of view.
('50', 121, 8, 22, 201434) I dont think I shall be able to write the reminiscences of Gokhale.
('50', 121, 8, 23, 201502) My preoccupation with spinning will let me do nothing else.

('50', 122, 3, 4, 201756) PRABHAVATI, I have your letter.
('50', 122, 3, 5, 201788) The postcard addressed to you at Patna does not seem to have reached you, for I had asked you in it to send me a wire but I did not get any.
('50', 122, 3, 6, 201929) I now learn from the letter that your mother in law has passed away and that both Jayaprakash and you have been a good deal shaken.
('50', 122, 3, 7, 202061) Why should we ever grieve over death, which no one can escape?
('50', 122, 3, 8, 202124) Moreover, the lady was quite ill.
('50', 122, 3, 9, 202158) She hasbeen released from her suffering.
('50', 122, 3, 10, 202199) Hence, those whom she has left behind suffer because of their selfishness.
('50', 122, 3, 11, 202274) Your duty now is to see that you get strong quickly.
('50', 122, 3, 12, 202327) I dont think your disease has yet left you.
('50', 122, 3, 13, 202371) For some time, you may also write directly to me.
('50', 122, 3, 14, 202421) This in addition to the letters which you should continue to send through the Ashram.
('50', 122, 3, 15, 202507) May God grant patience in suffering to you all.
('50', 122, 3, 16, 202555) I keep good health.

('50', 122, 8, 25, 203000) If not more, learn only one verse at a time.

('50', 123, 13, 19, 204028) I have your letter.
('50', 123, 13, 20, 204048) You are greedy.
('50', 123, 13, 21, 204064) It is of course good to be greedy when you are young.
('50', 123, 13, 22, 204118) But while being greedy one should also exercise restraint.
('50', 123, 13, 23, 204177) Hence, of all the things you may wish to learn you should first learn what will be more useful for service.
('50', 123, 13, 24, 204285) Another restraint is that whatever you learn you must do thoroughly and not leave half way.
('50', 123, 13, 25, 204377) Do learn sewing.
('50', 123, 13, 26, 204394) But do not be hasty.

('50', 124, 1, 2, 204474) you do not enjoy weaving is that you do not yet know it well.
('50', 124, 1, 3, 204536) In the beginning all efforts at learning seem uninteresting.
('50', 124, 1, 4, 204597) Many people do not like arithmetic because they find it difficult to learn.
('50', 124, 1, 5, 204673) But those who know it can enjoy it as much as they would a novel.
('50', 124, 1, 6, 204739) Another reason is that you do not still have enough love for the poor.
('50', 124, 1, 7, 204810) How can a person who realizes that every yard of khadi that he produces will help to cover the back of a poor man fail to take pleasure in producing it?
('50', 124, 1, 8, 204963) A mother does with joy for her child and God for his bhakta what other people would find a boring task.
('50', 124, 1, 9, 205067) The truth is that we do not as yet feel real love of service.
('50', 124, 1, 10, 205129) A servant should find equal pleasure in all forms of service.
('50', 124, 1, 11, 205191) All service given sincerely is of equal worth.
('50', 124, 1, 12, 205238) Ponder over the verse He who offers me with devotion a leaf, a flower, or fruit or water.

('50', 124, 8, 24, 205776) But it is a perfect one.
('50', 124, 8, 25, 205801) I believe that the strength which women possess is given them by God.
('50', 124, 8, 26, 205871) Hence they are bound to succeed in whatever they undertake.

('50', 125, 6, 8, 206530) BHAGWANJI, The Ashram is for the men of ordinary category.
('50', 125, 6, 9, 206589) It cannot be said that the Ashram is curt towards Girirajji if he has reached the height you regard him to have reached, but that his great soul can no more be accommodated there.
('50', 125, 6, 10, 206769) The decision taken by Narandas is spiritual.
('50', 125, 6, 11, 206814) The spiritual point of view is to act as guided by whatever ideals we have accepted for the Ashram.
('50', 125, 6, 12, 206914) Personally I think Giriraj has fallen into delusion.
('50', 125, 6, 13, 206967) I would not engage myself or involve another in the regimen undertaken by us if it is not going to help us realize the atman.
('50', 125, 6, 14, 207093) It is possible that God might live in the house of a scavenger and He may not be found in that of a Vedantin.
('50', 125, 6, 15, 207203) Our action should accord with our lofty sentiments.
('50', 125, 6, 16, 207255) Giriraj is a noble person, he is humble too; he will therefore come round after his ramblings.
('50', 125, 6, 17, 207350) The credit will go to the Ashram even if we were to learn from him in case he proves our way to be wrong.

('50', 126, 3, 4, 207703) KASHINATH, I have your letter.
('50', 126, 3, 5, 207734) There is not the slightest reason to be grieved by the death of friends.
('50', 126, 3, 6, 207807) None ever dies before his time.
('50', 126, 3, 7, 207839) The notion of untimely death is a delusion.
('50', 126, 3, 8, 207883) Even the death of a day old baby is not an untimely one.
('50', 126, 3, 9, 207940) It only means that the actions to be performed through that body had been performed.
('50', 126, 3, 10, 208025) We feel pained by death only because of our ignorance and selfishness.
('50', 126, 3, 11, 208096) We feel agitated over thedeath of friends or others because of our ignorance of the souls attributes and because we do not wish ourselves to die.
('50', 126, 3, 12, 208242) Yes, we owe a duty to the widows.
('50', 126, 3, 13, 208276) If they come and can observe the rules, in my view at any rate there should be no objection to admitting them.
('50', 126, 3, 14, 208387) However, as the responsibility lies on Narandas and Gangabehn, you should discuss the matter with them.
('50', 126, 3, 15, 208491) Show this letter to them.
('50', 126, 3, 16, 208517) Though Kalavati is indeed in a hard plight, she will be fully tried and the strength of her mind tested.
('50', 126, 3, 17, 208622) I am writing to her.
('50', 126, 3, 18, 208643) I have received the Hindi translation of Kumarappas speech.
('50', 126, 3, 19, 208703) Mahavir Prasads zeal is beyond praise.
('50', 126, 3, 20, 208742) He has already started working for the third edition of the Gita.
('50', 126, 3, 21, 208808) You ought to get over your depression now.
('50', 126, 3, 22, 208851) If any depressing thoughts or impure desires arise in your mind, note them every time and drive them out.
('50', 126, 3, 23, 208957) Do not let your mind dwell on them; do not even debate within your mind how they occurred, but keep the mind engaged in good thoughts.
('50', 126, 3, 24, 209092) The golden means of doing which is that the mind, too, should be kept fully occupied in some external activity, so that it may have no time at all to wander.

('50', 127, 3, 4, 209433) MAHALAKSHMI, I have your letter.
('50', 127, 3, 5, 209466) We can easily get rid of any habit when we begin to dislike it.
('50', 127, 3, 6, 209530) And a woman with your strong resolve should experience no difficulty at all in doing so.
('50', 127, 3, 7, 209619) You are doing well in clinging to the diet which you have adopted.
('50', 127, 3, 8, 209686) As we observe others becoming more indifferent towards or losing faith in the programme of picketing liquor booths, etc., we should become more vigilant ourselves and let our faith shine more brightly.
('50', 127, 3, 9, 209888) That is bound to produce an effect.

('50', 127, 8, 14, 210059) ROHINI, I have your beautiful letter.
('50', 127, 8, 15, 210097) If Hamida learns Gujarati well, surely the credit will go to you.
('50', 127, 8, 16, 210163) It is because picketing of liquor booths is a difficult job that it has been entrusted to women.
('50', 127, 8, 17, 210260) It requires the utmost purity of character and the deepest faith.
('50', 127, 8, 18, 210326) Women possess both in greater measure than men.

('50', 128, 3, 4, 210546) VASUMATI, You need not spare me the trouble of reading a letter.
('50', 128, 3, 5, 210611) A father is always eager to get a letter from his son or daughter.
('50', 128, 3, 6, 210678) For about ten or fifteen days, I lived only on, vegetables, milk and curds; that is, I had stopped eating even raisins and dates.
('50', 128, 3, 7, 210808) I have started taking these again from today.
('50', 128, 3, 8, 210854) After some time, I will go back to vegetables.
('50', 128, 3, 9, 210901) In that way I shall discover what suits me best.
('50', 128, 3, 10, 210950) If I can do with vegetables, that will save money too.
('50', 128, 3, 11, 211005) But I will not persist [too long in the experiment].
('50', 128, 3, 12, 211058) The present weight of 104 Ib.
('50', 128, 3, 13, 211088) is quite good.

('50', 128, 8, 19, 211252) GANGABEHN, I have your letter.
('50', 128, 8, 20, 211283) You should certainly write to me and let me know your thoughts on Manibehns departure, as also all that you think about other matters.
('50', 128, 8, 21, 211418) Your last letter was all right.
('50', 128, 8, 22, 211450) Let the world see us as we are.
('50', 128, 8, 23, 211482) We should especially show ourselves as we are to those whom we love.
('50', 128, 8, 24, 211551) No one can immediately put into practice his or her ideals.
('50', 128, 8, 25, 211611) But everyone can strive to do so.
('50', 128, 8, 26, 211645) This you do everyday.

('50', 129, 3, 7, 212111) Enter Sarojinidevis heart.

('50', 129, 3, 9, 212178) Try to find some free time for such tasks.
('50', 129, 3, 10, 212221) You will have to undertake much more responsible tasks in future.
('50', 129, 3, 11, 212287) Are you now free from worry about your health?

('50', 129, 8, 19, 212566) I am never late in replying.
('50', 129, 8, 20, 212595) In fact, you dont write and therefore feel that my letter reaches you late.
('50', 129, 8, 21, 212671) If the postscript to your letter is in Satyadevis hand, her handwriting is as good as yours.

('50', 130, 2, 3, 212975) [October 13, 1930] 1
('50', 130, 4, 4, 212996) I hope you have got the straying letters.
('50', 130, 4, 5, 213038) I am sure they have not been intercepted, but have been delayed in transit from place to place.
('50', 130, 5, 6, 213134) It is evident, my scolding as you call it, was well deserved, for you have returned in a dilapidated condition.
('50', 130, 5, 7, 213246) On the top of that, you had a bad accident.
('50', 130, 5, 8, 213290) Now you would be as good as your word and take full rest.
('50', 130, 5, 9, 213348) I was much relieved to understand that you had been visiting the Sardar.
('50', 130, 5, 10, 213421) That showed that you were well enough to travel.
('50', 130, 5, 11, 213470) I am still at the Gandiv wheel, and my rapture continues, if anything it has increased.
('50', 130, 5, 12, 213558) I am spinning scientifically now, i.e., with a yard measure underneath the track of the yarn as it is drawn.
('50', 130, 5, 13, 213667) I can draw 8 threads in one minute and I pull at least two feet to each draw.
('50', 130, 5, 14, 213745) This means 240 rounds or 300 yards per hour.
('50', 130, 5, 15, 213790) But of course, I do nothingof the sort in an hour but that is not because of any defect in the Gandiv.
('50', 130, 5, 16, 213893) The less output is due to breakages and consequent waste of time.
('50', 130, 5, 17, 213959) But since adopting the method of concentration, breakages have very considerably reduced.
('50', 130, 5, 18, 214049) I therefore often reach 200 yards per hour which for me is very good.
('50', 130, 5, 19, 214119) You will publish nothing just yet of my views about the Gandiv.
('50', 130, 5, 20, 214183) I want the report of those who may try at the Ashram.
('50', 130, 5, 21, 214237) Most of all I want your report, if you have the leisure and the inclination to give it a trial.
('50', 130, 5, 22, 214333) I know that you all have not the time that I have for these experiments.
('50', 130, 5, 23, 214406) You will therefore do whatever is possible and if you think it necessary.
('50', 130, 5, 24, 214480) I, having nothing else to do, may easily exaggerate the merits of a thing which I may have disregarded before as I did and which now gives comparative satisfaction.
('50', 130, 6, 25, 214645) 1 The 100th hymn, referred to in the postscript, was translated on this date; Vide Ashram Bhajanavali, 15 12 1930. The letter however bears the date 12 10 1930 in Mirabehns handwriting.

('50', 131, 7, 15, 215503) Do you digest food properly?
('50', 131, 7, 16, 215532) Do you still take medicine?
('50', 131, 7, 17, 215560) What work have you taken up?
('50', 131, 7, 18, 215589) How is Nimu?
('50', 131, 7, 19, 215602) And Sumitra?
('50', 131, 7, 20, 215615) What happened about the khadi implements centre?

('50', 131, 13, 28, 215877) I have your letter.
('50', 131, 13, 29, 215897) Inspire Dhiru and Rambhau to write to me.
('50', 131, 13, 30, 215939) Walk slowly.
('50', 131, 13, 31, 215952) Do not take upon yourself much work.
('50', 131, 13, 32, 215989) I liked your having gone away from Almora.
('50', 131, 13, 33, 216032) Do not take upon yourself any big responsibility.

('50', 132, 1, 3, 216200) Who are the persons now in Almora whom I know?
('50', 132, 1, 4, 216247) Is Mrs. Cook there?
('50', 132, 1, 5, 216267) Where is Mohan Joshi?
('50', 132, 1, 6, 216289) Has Shantilal recovered completely?
('50', 132, 1, 7, 216325) What do you do about milk there?
('50', 132, 1, 8, 216358) What is the expense incurred?
('50', 132, 1, 9, 216388) Write to me regularly.
('50', 132, 1, 10, 216411) For the time being, Kakasaheb has suggested Savyasachi as the name for your spinning wheel and it seems to be good.
('50', 132, 1, 11, 216527) The only fault perhaps may be that it is a Sanskrit word.
('50', 132, 1, 12, 216585) There is no harm if you stop thinking about yourself.
('50', 132, 1, 13, 216639) Enjoy today, who has seen tomorrow.

('50', 132, 5, 18, 216803) October 9/14, 1930
('50', 132, 6, 19, 216822) NARANDAS, Your packet was given to me late last evening.
('50', 132, 6, 20, 216879) I will certainly inquire why you got the post late.
('50', 132, 6, 21, 216931) But that will often happen and you should not, therefore, worry if you do not get the post on the day expected.
('50', 132, 6, 22, 217043) You should, however, be regular in posting the letters at your end.
('50', 132, 6, 23, 217111) Both of us were weighed today.
('50', 132, 6, 24, 217142) We are weighed every Thursday.
('50', 132, 6, 25, 217173) Kakasahebs weight is between 115 and 116, which means that there is some improvement.
('50', 132, 6, 26, 217259) My weight came to 104. I have discontinued taking enema since four days ago.
('50', 132, 6, 27, 217336) I eat tandalja and that has had a beneficial effect.
('50', 132, 6, 28, 217389) I have not given up ratalu altogether.
('50', 132, 6, 29, 217428) I intend to take it twice or thrice in a week.
('50', 132, 6, 30, 217475) On the other days I will eat patakalu or some other vegetable.
('50', 132, 6, 31, 217538) I still continue tomatoes.
('50', 132, 6, 32, 217565) So far, I have not felt the need for fruits.
('50', 132, 6, 33, 217610) If the weight remains steady, I intend to continue as I am doing.
('50', 132, 6, 34, 217676) My promise that I will take care of my health in whatever experiments I make should reassure all of you.
('50', 132, 6, 35, 217781) I do not feel that your letters are too long.
('50', 132, 6, 36, 217827) I should certainly like to see that the burden on you does not increase.
('50', 132, 6, 37, 217900) Your work is to see the letters which I write, to distribute them to the addressees and to write to me.
('50', 132, 6, 38, 218004) I think your having to send letters written by others is an extra duty.

('50', 133, 1, 4, 218273) I got Radhas long reply.
('50', 133, 1, 5, 218298) She writes in it about .
('50', 133, 1, 6, 218323) 1 having stolen something and other such matters.
('50', 133, 1, 7, 218373) She says that Keshu was upset when he knew about the thing.
('50', 133, 1, 8, 218433) What are the facts?
('50', 133, 1, 9, 218453) Read the letter I shall write to .
('50', 133, 1, 10, 218488) 2. I have nothing to say about your decision regarding Giriraj.
('50', 133, 1, 11, 218552) I think it is perfectly correct.
('50', 133, 1, 12, 218585) You alone know all the facts.
('50', 133, 1, 13, 218615) I hope to know by and by what has been done about the children.
('50', 133, 1, 14, 218679) What can one say about Amidas?
('50', 133, 1, 15, 218710) His courage inspires nothing but respect.
('50', 133, 1, 16, 218752) I feel unhappy in so far as I was responsible for his vow of not taking milk.
('50', 133, 1, 17, 218830) Now that his father is there, I dont worry any more about him.
('50', 133, 1, 18, 218893) We should do all we can to look after him.
('50', 133, 1, 19, 218936) It is God who will protect him.
('50', 133, 1, 20, 218968) I suppose Bhagwanji will accept responsibility for Manibehns expenses.
('50', 133, 1, 21, 219039) I saw Pyarelal.
('50', 133, 1, 22, 219055) No harm has been done to his health.
('50', 133, 1, 23, 219092) It is weak, though.
('50', 133, 1, 24, 219112) I believe I shall now be able to see him frequently.
('50', 133, 1, 25, 219165) He gets bread and milk at present.
('50', 133, 1, 26, 219200) I didnt see any letter from Chitalia.
('50', 133, 1, 27, 219238) I dont remember at the moment the sum which he requires as help.
('50', 133, 1, 28, 219303) I think I did ask someone to note it.
('50', 133, 1, 29, 219341) His letter is likely to be in one of the files.
('50', 133, 1, 30, 219389) Shivabhai and Chhaganlal will probably know about it.
('50', 133, 1, 31, 219443) Perhaps Raojibhai, too, may know.
('50', 133, 1, 32, 219477) Chitalia himself will be able to tell you.
('50', 133, 1, 33, 219520) Has he asked for Rs. 1,500 for the building?
('50', 133, 1, 34, 219565) Ascertain the position and do what you think best.
('50', 133, 1, 35, 219616) If necessary, you may write to me again about the matter.
('50', 133, 1, 36, 219674) Read the letter I have written to him.
('50', 133, 2, 37, 219713) October 13, 1930
('50', 133, 3, 38, 219730) I read the new ordinance.
('50', 133, 3, 39, 219756) You, too, will have to think about the matter.
('50', 133, 3, 40, 219803) I myself wish to say nothing from here.
('50', 133, 3, 41, 219843) Discuss the matter with the person who is the leader there and go on doing what you think right.
('50', 133, 3, 42, 219940) I am not surprised by the ordinance.
('50', 133, 3, 43, 219977) I did expect some such measure.
('50', 133, 4, 44, 220009) 1 The names have been omitted.
('50', 134, 0, 1, 220040) VOL.50: 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 135
('50', 134, 1, 2, 220084) Tuesday morning, October 14, 1930
('50', 134, 2, 3, 220118) In this series, I have dealt cursorily with the importance of vows, but it is perhaps necessary to consider at some length their bearing on a godly life.
('50', 134, 2, 4, 220272) Now that I have discussed all our vows except that of swadeshi, let us consider the necessity of vows.
('50', 134, 2, 5, 220375) There is a powerful school of thinkers who concede the propriety of observing certain rules but do not acknowledge the necessity of vows.
('50', 134, 2, 6, 220513) They go even so far as to suggest that vows are a sign of weakness and may even be harmful.
('50', 134, 2, 7, 220605) Again they say that, if a rule is subsequently discovered to be inconvenient or sinful, to adhere to it after such discovery would be positively wrong.
('50', 134, 2, 8, 220757) They say: It is a good thing to abstain from liquor, but what harm is there in taking it occasionally, say on medical grounds?
('50', 134, 2, 9, 220884) A pledge of total abstinence would be a needless handicap; and as with liquor, so with other things.
('50', 134, 2, 10, 220985) Why may we not even speak an untruth for a good end? This argument does not convince me.
('50', 134, 2, 11, 221074) A vow means unflinching determination, and helps us against temptations.
('50', 134, 2, 12, 221147) Determination is worth nothing if it bends before discomfort.
('50', 134, 2, 13, 221209) The universal experience of humanity supports the view that progress isimpossible without inflexible determination.
('50', 134, 2, 14, 221325) There cannot be a vow to commit a sin.
('50', 134, 2, 15, 221364) Such a vow represents a wicked nature.
('50', 134, 2, 16, 221403) In the case of a vow first thought to be meritorious but later found to be sinful, there arises a clear necessity to give it up.
('50', 134, 2, 17, 221532) But no one takes, or ought to take, vows about dubious matters.
('50', 134, 2, 18, 221596) Vows can be taken only on points of universally recognized principles, which, however, we do not habitually act upon.
('50', 134, 2, 19, 221714) The possibility of sin in such a case is more or less imaginary.
('50', 134, 2, 20, 221779) A devotee of Truth cannot stop to consider if someone will not be injured by his telling the truth, for he believes that truth can never do harm.
('50', 134, 2, 21, 221925) So also about total abstinence.
('50', 134, 2, 22, 221957) The abstainer will either make an exception as regards medicine, or will be prepared to risk his life in fulfilment of his full vow.
('50', 134, 2, 23, 222090) What does it matter if we happen to lose our lives through a pledge of total abstinence?
('50', 134, 2, 24, 222179) There can be no guarantee that our lives will be prolonged by liquor, and even if life is thus prolonged for a moment, it may be ended the very next through some other agency.
('50', 134, 2, 25, 222355) On the other hand, the example of a man who gives up his life rather than his pledge is likely to wean drunkards from liquor and thus become a great power for good in the world.
('50', 134, 2, 26, 222533) Only they can hope some time to
('50', 135, 0, 1, 222565) 136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 135, 1, 2, 222607) see God who have nobly determined to bear witness to the faith that is in them even at the cost of life itself.
('50', 135, 1, 3, 222719) Taking vows is not a sign of weakness but of strength.
('50', 135, 1, 4, 222774) To do at any cost what one ought to do constitutes a vow.
('50', 135, 1, 5, 222832) It becomes a bulwark of strength.
('50', 135, 1, 6, 222866) It makes no difference whether such a resolve is called a vow or known by some other name.
('50', 135, 1, 7, 222957) A man, who says that he will do something as far as possible betrays either his pride or his weakness, though he himself may attribute it to his humility.
('50', 135, 1, 8, 223112) There is, in fact, not a trace of humility in such an attitude of mind.
('50', 135, 1, 9, 223184) I have noticed in my own case, as well as in that of others, that the limitation as far as possible provides a fatal loophole.
('50', 135, 1, 10, 223311) To do something as far as possible is to succumb to the very first temptation.
('50', 135, 1, 11, 223390) There is no sense in saying that we will observe truth as far as possible.
('50', 135, 1, 12, 223465) Even as no businessman will look at a note in which a man promises to pay a certain amount on a certain date as far as possible, so will God refuse to accept a promissory note drawn by a man who will observe truth as far as possible.
('50', 135, 1, 13, 223699) God is the very image of the vow.
('50', 135, 1, 14, 223733) God would cease to be God if He swerved from His own laws even by a hairs breadth.
('50', 135, 1, 15, 223816) The sun is a great keeper of observances; hence the possibility of measuring timeand publishing almanacs.
('50', 135, 1, 16, 223922) He has created in us the faith that he always rises and will for ever continue to rise, and thereby given us a sense of security.
('50', 135, 1, 17, 224052) All business depends upon men fulfilling their promises.
('50', 135, 1, 18, 224109) There could be no commerce if merchants did not regard themselves as bound by their word to one another.
('50', 135, 1, 19, 224214) We thus see that keeping a vow is a universal practice.
('50', 135, 1, 20, 224270) Are such promises less necessary in character building or self realization?
('50', 135, 1, 21, 224346) We should, therefore, never doubt the necessity of vows for the purpose of self purification and self realization.
('50', 135, 2, 22, 224461) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] About the Gandiv spinning wheel and about my diet you will get some news in my letter to Mirabehn.

('50', 136, 9, 12, 225212) I have your letter.
('50', 136, 9, 13, 225232) Mirabehn too had made some reference.
('50', 136, 9, 14, 225270) No one is perfect in this world.
('50', 136, 9, 15, 225303) Our duty is to rid ourselves of the imperfections and that is what human effort is for.
('50', 136, 9, 16, 225391) Despair has no place as long as we put in our own efforts.
('50', 136, 9, 17, 225450) In spiritual matters we need infinitely greater courage than what we need in worldly matters.
('50', 136, 9, 18, 225544) One should never give up self confidence.
('50', 136, 9, 19, 225586) Faith can make everything possible.

('50', 136, 9, 21, 225674) In fact, I believe that he will have true rest and peace in the jail.
('50', 136, 9, 22, 225744) 2 He very much needed both for many years.
('50', 136, 9, 23, 225787) God has thus granted him both.

('50', 137, 11, 21, 226829) What was the cause of your fasting for three days?
('50', 137, 11, 22, 226880) Dont forget that you are only a child.

('50', 138, 3, 5, 227365) Your intentions are no doubt pure but one should never be content with ones purity of motive[alone].
('50', 138, 3, 6, 227466) The necessity of knowledge has been accepted for the reason that one may not commit an error in spite of a pure motive.
('50', 138, 3, 7, 227586) This also you should know for certain that as you achieve purity the Ashram too becomes pure to that extent.
('50', 138, 3, 8, 227695) The purity of the Ashram is not different from that of any Ashramite.
('50', 138, 3, 9, 227765) As far as the Ashram goes, there is no one who can surpass Narandas in the matter of rendering help in spiritual difficulties.

('50', 138, 7, 14, 228046) Thursday evening [October 16, 1930] 1
('50', 138, 8, 15, 228084) NARANDAS, I got the letters sent by you.
('50', 138, 8, 16, 228125) I write this letter specially regarding Amidas.
('50', 138, 8, 17, 228173) It will, therefore, be immediately cleared.
('50', 138, 8, 18, 228217) Will Amidas agree to take raw eggs?
('50', 138, 8, 19, 228253) There are two kinds of eggs, one to which exception may be taken and the other unexceptionable.
('50', 138, 8, 20, 228349) The former are those which ultimately produce chicken, and the unexceptionable are those which produce no life.
('50', 138, 8, 21, 228461) Hens lay such eggs without their having been inseminated by cocks.
('50', 138, 8, 22, 228528) This is a well known fact.
('50', 138, 8, 23, 228555) Parnerkar will probably know about it.
('50', 138, 8, 24, 228594) Such eggs are available in the market.
('50', 138, 8, 25, 228633) Mostly Europeans look after the production of such eggs.
('50', 138, 8, 26, 228690) There is a farm for this purpose near Miraj.
('50', 138, 8, 27, 228735) You will find some correspondence on this subject in my file.
('50', 138, 8, 28, 228797) You need not, however, search for it.
('50', 138, 8, 29, 228835) Many Parsis in Ahmedabad will be able to give you information about where such eggs are available.
('50', 138, 8, 30, 228934) Personally I believe that eggs of this kind are less

('50', 139, 1, 2, 229056) objectionable than milk.
('50', 139, 1, 3, 229081) In eating them, we do not deprive any creature of its food, as we do by taking milk.
('50', 139, 1, 4, 229166) If Amidas agrees, obtain such eggs immediately.
('50', 139, 1, 5, 229214) They are to be used in this manner.
('50', 139, 1, 6, 229250) Break an unfertilised egg, mix its contents with eight ounces of water and keep the mixture in a bottle.
('50', 139, 1, 7, 229355) Give him an ounce of this mixture every hour.
('50', 139, 1, 8, 229401) He will soon gain strength.
('50', 139, 1, 9, 229429) The mixture will completely serve the purpose of milk.
('50', 139, 1, 10, 229484) I can say that Manus life was saved by this mixture.
('50', 139, 1, 11, 229537) Such eggs are a hundred times better than cod liver oil.
('50', 139, 1, 12, 229594) Tell Amidas that if there is any sin in acting upon this advice, I take it upon myself.
('50', 139, 1, 13, 229682) I have not publicly advocated the use of such eggs because, when self indulgence is on the increase and all kinds of medicines are being consumed without hesitation, I did not think it proper to add one more to the list.
('50', 139, 1, 14, 229903) Amidass case is quite different.
('50', 139, 1, 15, 229936) I hope Parnerkar has recovered.

('50', 139, 6, 21, 230231) If Sita is given enough fruit to eat, she need have no vegetables at all.
('50', 139, 6, 22, 230305) For the present, I think fresh milk, fruit and curds, which should not be sour, will be all right for her.
('50', 139, 6, 23, 230412) If her teeth are strong enough, she may be allowed to chew a few hard biscuits or pieces of khakhara during the day.
('50', 139, 6, 24, 230529) She should learn to chew properly what she eats.
('50', 139, 6, 25, 230578) Madhavjibhais two children are being brought up on this diet, and they have radiant health.
('50', 139, 6, 26, 230670) Have you consulted a doctor for your ears?

('50', 141, 3, 4, 232245) SHARDA, Your letter.
('50', 141, 3, 5, 232266) But how did you fall ill?
('50', 141, 3, 6, 232292) Was there any mistake about your diet?
('50', 141, 3, 7, 232331) As far as your asthma is concerned you must treat it so ruthlessly that it does not visit you again.
('50', 141, 3, 8, 232432) You will succeed if you are firm.
('50', 141, 3, 9, 232466) Do you take sun bath?
('50', 141, 3, 10, 232488) Do you massage your chest?
('50', 141, 3, 11, 232515) Do you keep your bowels clean?
('50', 141, 3, 12, 232546) After the morning prayers you must do deep breathing on an empty stomach.
('50', 141, 3, 13, 232620) This would clear the lungs.
('50', 141, 3, 14, 232648) We must take deep breaths so that the oxygen may clear our lungs.
('50', 141, 3, 15, 232714) You must understand this point from Chimanlal.

('50', 141, 8, 21, 232965) It is not likely now that you will get this.
('50', 141, 8, 22, 233010) Dont take your worries with you to the jail.
('50', 141, 8, 23, 233055) We have learnt from the Gita that God takes upon Himself our cares.
('50', 141, 8, 24, 233123) Remember, moreover, that when our thoughts are waiting for an opportunity to show themselves in action, they become more powerful than action.
('50', 141, 8, 25, 233266) Those, therefore, who are ever ready for work, their thoughts, too, bear fruit.
('50', 141, 8, 26, 233346) You should not mind if you get rest and the others outside are tested.

('50', 142, 3, 4, 233583) DEAR SISTER, I was very glad to have your letter.
('50', 142, 3, 5, 233633) Death is a highway which all of us must tread, whether we wish or no.
('50', 142, 3, 6, 233703) And though countless travellers tread it, it ever seems deserted.
('50', 142, 3, 7, 233769) Hence this is also the path of supreme peace.
('50', 142, 3, 8, 233815) He who is afraid to take it, feels agitated; he who remains fearless enjoys the bliss of peace.

('50', 142, 8, 15, 234093) I have never believed anything against Dahibehn.
('50', 142, 8, 16, 234142) I have seen no sign of impurity in her conduct or in her eyes.
('50', 142, 8, 17, 234205) I think she has done well in refusing to leave the place.
('50', 142, 8, 18, 234263) I had a letter from Raojibhai.
('50', 142, 8, 19, 234294) The time seems to have come now for the women to shoulder a heavy responsibility.

('50', 143, 3, 7, 234702) Do not get disheartened.
('50', 143, 3, 8, 234727) I saw Pyarelal again.
('50', 143, 3, 9, 234749) I shall see him once more.
('50', 143, 3, 10, 234776) He has no complaint now.
('50', 143, 3, 11, 234801) I read in the papers about the Government having taken possession of the Sevashram hospitals too.

('50', 143, 8, 18, 235156) I think it was given away to some person at his request.

('50', 144, 8, 13, 235857) I must apologize to Bharati.
('50', 144, 8, 14, 235886) She can certainly ask what sort of a friend I must be if, after having been such a friend, I forget even her name!
('50', 144, 8, 15, 236001) But wont she show regard for the infirmities of old age and forgive me?
('50', 144, 8, 16, 236073) If she doesnt mind, ask her to write to me.
('50', 144, 8, 17, 236117) Personally I believe that the only remedy for your ear complaint is better general health.
('50', 144, 8, 18, 236208) Since you also believe so, you should take Kuhne baths and sun baths as I have advised you to do.
('50', 144, 8, 19, 236306) You should also do sufficient exercise.
('50', 144, 8, 20, 236346) You should go out for a walk in the early morning.
('50', 144, 8, 21, 236397) What is the condition of Taras head?
('50', 144, 8, 22, 236434) I was pleased to see Nanabhais handwriting.
('50', 144, 8, 23, 236478) Tara should send my blessings to them both.

('50', 145, 3, 4, 236753) RAMDAS, I got your letter.
('50', 145, 3, 5, 236780) Why pine over what you do not get?
('50', 145, 3, 6, 236815) Formerly, prisoners were not allowed to receive any visitors.
('50', 145, 3, 7, 236877) Now they have relaxed the rule somewhat.
('50', 145, 3, 8, 236918) For the present, therefore, I receive visitors.
('50', 145, 3, 9, 236966) Is it not our principle that once we are in prison, we must not mind if we are not permitted to receive visitors?
('50', 145, 3, 10, 237080) Rather, that is a matter of honour for a prisoner.
('50', 145, 3, 11, 237131) If we think this way, we would not feel hurt.
('50', 145, 3, 12, 237177) Does Sumitra still suffer from constipation?
('50', 145, 3, 13, 237222) She must get over it.
('50', 145, 3, 14, 237244) I have already asked you concerning Nimu.
('50', 145, 3, 15, 237286) Now that you have fallen in love with reading, do not leave it off.
('50', 145, 3, 16, 237354) Read a little of whatever you like, even if you get only ten minutes for it.

('50', 146, 8, 16, 238679) RADHIKA, I have your letter.
('50', 146, 8, 17, 238708) In your previous letter I saw no impropriety.
('50', 146, 8, 18, 238754) You had only poured out in it the thoughts which agitated your mind and you had a right to do so.
('50', 146, 8, 19, 238852) Humility cannot be learnt through formal training, but it grows of itself as one cultivates the spirit of non violence.
('50', 146, 8, 20, 238972) Outward humility of behaviour, which we find in royal families, can be learnt in a formal manner.
('50', 146, 8, 21, 239070) It is, however, not true humility, but is only a part of cultured manners.
('50', 146, 8, 22, 239145) In the humility which I advise, one has to forget the sense of I and become a mere cipher.
('50', 146, 8, 23, 239236) Can that be learnt through any lessons?
('50', 146, 8, 24, 239276) But one who has realized the bodys transitoriness and has in some measure become aware of the self soon becomes humble.
('50', 146, 8, 25, 239396) What fine humility would it be on your part if, even though I should speak in anger to you, you merely listened with lowered eyes like those of a poor cow and did not even feel angry with me?

('50', 147, 6, 14, 240170) A stitch in time saves nine.
('50', 147, 6, 15, 240199) This saying is completely true.
('50', 147, 6, 16, 240231) I interpret image worship in two senses.
('50', 147, 6, 17, 240272) In one form of image worship, the person who contemplates the image becomes absorbed in the contemplation of the qualities for which it stands.
('50', 147, 6, 18, 240416) This is image worship in its wholesome form.
('50', 147, 6, 19, 240461) In the other form of it, the person who contemplates the image does not think about the qualities but looks upon the image itself as the primary thing.
('50', 147, 6, 20, 240613) This is idolatry and is an evil.

('50', 149, 3, 6, 242067) Because Tarini was performing much service we may grieve out of selfishness, but from an unselfish point of view Tarinis death was preferable.
('50', 149, 3, 7, 242210) Such a frail body caused his soul much pain.
('50', 149, 3, 8, 242255) We may believe for certain that a dutiful soul like his is bound to be reincarnated and serve even more.
('50', 149, 4, 9, 242360) I have received Satis Babus translation 1. I am tempted to brush up my Bengali in order to understand it well but the thought of charkha deters me.
('50', 149, 4, 10, 242508) See the annotation on the tenth 2 shloka for Better is knowledge than practice. 3 The meaning will then be clear.But if you have doubts still, write to me.
('50', 149, 4, 11, 242664) How are Charu and Arun?
('50', 149, 4, 12, 242688) Give my love to all brothers and sisters.

('50', 150, 2, 3, 243150) YERAVDA MANDIR, October 19, 1930
('50', 150, 3, 4, 243183) MIRA, I have your letter from Bombay.
('50', 150, 3, 5, 243221) I was glad to learn that you were feeling better.
('50', 150, 3, 6, 243271) You must not let the mind get into the state described by you.
('50', 150, 3, 7, 243334) If you work with detachment, you will refuse to be rushed and you will refuse to let anything get on your nerves.
('50', 150, 3, 8, 243448) Having put ones whole heart into a thing entrusted or undertaken, one can leave the result to God.
('50', 150, 3, 9, 243547) Then there can be no rush and no worry.
('50', 150, 3, 10, 243587) You know the story of King Janak.
('50', 150, 3, 11, 243621) He was Duty personified.
('50', 150, 3, 12, 243646) His capital was in flames.
('50', 150, 3, 13, 243673) He knew it.
('50', 150, 3, 14, 243685) But some busybody reported it to him.
('50', 150, 3, 15, 243723) His answer was, What care I whether my capital is reduced to ashes or remains intact! He had done all he could to save it.
('50', 150, 3, 16, 243846) His going to the scene of operations and fussing would have distracted the attention of the fire brigade and others and made matters worse.
('50', 150, 3, 17, 243986) He was but an agent of providence.
('50', 150, 3, 18, 244021) As such he had done his part and was therefore quits and at ease.
('50', 150, 3, 19, 244087) So may, must, we be, if we have done our best, whether our work flourishes or perishes.
('50', 150, 3, 20, 244175) The Gandiv still gives me joy and satisfaction.
('50', 150, 3, 21, 244223) Nothing has yet broken down.
('50', 150, 3, 22, 244252) Whereas I took five hours before, I now finish well within 3 hours.
('50', 150, 3, 23, 244320) The afternoon is now free for other work except for the takli.
('50', 150, 3, 24, 244383) So on your travels you may take the Gandiv if it gives you as much satisfaction as it gives to me.
('50', 150, 3, 25, 244482) The cost of the pattern that I have is one rupee including the spindle and a box scooped in the platform and an incredibly simple device for keeping the spindle on one side of the platform.
('50', 150, 3, 26, 244672) For price and simplicity this wheel has no match.
('50', 150, 3, 27, 244722) I have discarded the bamboo holders and the wretched glass cylinders.
('50', 150, 3, 28, 244792) I think I told you this.
('50', 150, 3, 29, 244817) And it works without any foreign sound at all.

('50', 151, 3, 5, 245073) Chhaganlal will have some peace now and the people will be tested.
('50', 151, 3, 6, 245140) For the women, too, the time of testing is approaching.
('50', 151, 3, 7, 245196) My faith is becoming stronger.
('50', 151, 3, 8, 245227) We should become all the more resolute and vigilant, and be ever filled with joy in our hearts.
('50', 151, 3, 9, 245323) You should write to me more regularly now.
('50', 151, 3, 10, 245366) God will assuredly bless us.

('50', 151, 8, 18, 245654) RAIHANA, You seem to be a very clever girl.
('50', 151, 8, 19, 245698) After writing two or three letters in Gujarati, the poor girl now writes to me in Urdu!
('50', 151, 8, 20, 245786) But how is it love which asks for a return?
('50', 151, 8, 21, 245830) All the same, I will do my duty and make the return.
('50', 151, 8, 22, 245883) I found no difficulty in reading the letter since you have written it in such a clear and legible hand and the words you have chosen are so simple.
('50', 151, 8, 23, 246031) Now onwards you may write half your letter in Urdu.
('50', 151, 8, 24, 246083) It will help me since it will brush up my Urdu, and I may even write to you in Urdu provided all of you do not laugh at me among yourselves.
('50', 151, 8, 25, 246224) If I do that, will you not then consider it a full return?

('50', 152, 1, 3, 246408) But no matter; now that he is becoming youngerday after day, he will ask you to give him an account of your work.
('50', 152, 1, 4, 246522) I could not decipher one or two words in your letter.
('50', 152, 1, 5, 246576) I have kept the letter with me, and I will read it again and decipher those words; at any rate I will try to do so.
('50', 152, 1, 6, 246692) The letter paper is full now, and there is no space to apply a third adjective to you.

('50', 152, 6, 14, 247021) Having come to know you better, I dont feel inclined to lay the blame on you.
('50', 152, 6, 15, 247099) It is only that you two have different natures and, therefore, cannot live in harmony with each other.
('50', 152, 6, 16, 247202) In these circumstances, it is best that you should now live apart from each other.
('50', 152, 6, 17, 247285) God has blessed you with a large family.
('50', 152, 6, 18, 247326) You ought not to feel unhappy that you have no son.
('50', 152, 6, 19, 247378) We make no difference between a son and a daughter.
('50', 152, 6, 20, 247430) A daughter is the same to us as a son.
('50', 152, 6, 21, 247469) Moreover, all the girls are wise.
('50', 152, 6, 22, 247503) You should, therefore, live perfectly contented.
('50', 152, 6, 23, 247552) Jaisukhlal will meet your expenses.
('50', 152, 6, 24, 247588) Be devoted to each other, though living apart.
('50', 152, 6, 25, 247635) Dont feel unhappy in any way.
('50', 152, 6, 26, 247665) Neither of you is following an improper path.
('50', 152, 6, 27, 247711) When you can forget yourself and feel one with Jaisukhlal, you may certainly go back and live with him.
('50', 152, 6, 28, 247815) If you encourage the girls to go and live in the Ashram, they will be happier in life.

('50', 153, 3, 15, 248666) The difficulties experienced in sending Kalavati home should have been anticipated.

('50', 157, 3, 15, 253279) The water in the well should be disinfected with potassium permanganate or chlorine.
('50', 157, 3, 16, 253364) I think these can also be added in the water fetched from the river.
('50', 157, 3, 17, 253433) If a few drops of the solution are poured into the river water where it is stored, it will acquire a light rose colour.
('50', 157, 3, 18, 253553) After a while, the colour will settle at the bottom.
('50', 157, 3, 19, 253606) You should consult a doctor for more information about this.
('50', 157, 3, 20, 253667) I will write a separate letter about Amidas, 1
('50', 157, 4, 21, 253714) which is likely to be posted only tomorrow.
('50', 157, 4, 22, 253758) Inform me on what day you get it.
('50', 157, 4, 23, 253792) Inform Jamnalalji that I do not request the authorities to bring anyone here.
('50', 157, 4, 24, 253870) I did not do that even for Kakasaheb.
('50', 157, 4, 25, 253908) Jamnalalji or anybody else who wishes to come may do so by trying on their own or through Governments kindness.
('50', 157, 4, 26, 254020) I have been able to arrange that Pyarelal should see me from time to time.
('50', 157, 4, 27, 254095) There is an element of selfishness in requesting to be provided with a companion and, therefore, I do not make such a request.
('50', 157, 4, 28, 254222) What I should like is to be kept with all the others.
('50', 157, 4, 29, 254276) But how can I expect such good fortune?
('50', 157, 4, 30, 254316) Somebody who came to visit Kaka told him that Mathuradas, too, had made a similar request.
('50', 157, 4, 31, 254407) I have already written to you about Giriraj.
('50', 157, 4, 32, 254452) I dont feel that your decision is wrong.
('50', 157, 5, 33, 254493) 1 Vide Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 16 10 1930.
('50', 158, 0, 1, 254539) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 159
('50', 158, 1, 2, 254584) Write to Rajaji and tell him that generally I do not write to eminent leaders and, therefore, I will not write to him either.
('50', 158, 1, 3, 254710) But I remember him every day.
('50', 158, 1, 4, 254740) Ask him to give me news about Lakshmi and Subbiahs wife.
('50', 158, 1, 5, 254797) What state of health has he brought with him?
('50', 158, 2, 6, 254843) October 19, 1930
('50', 158, 3, 7, 254860) I see Prabhavatis name in your list of letters, but I dont find her letter.
('50', 158, 3, 8, 254936) I dont think they have kept it back here.
('50', 158, 3, 9, 254978) Either it must have been left out there or her name came to be included this time just because she writes every week.
('50', 158, 3, 10, 255096) Anyway I had a wire from her giving me news about her health.
('50', 158, 3, 11, 255158) She seems to be all right.
('50', 158, 3, 12, 255185) In Wardha they have been spinning on the takli very regularly.
('50', 158, 3, 13, 255248) You must have read a description of their work in Balkrishnas letter.
('50', 158, 3, 14, 255318) Bhaus speed is 132 rounds for half an hour.
('50', 158, 3, 15, 255362) This is wonderful.
('50', 158, 3, 16, 255381) You should find out how such speed can be acquired and publish a detailed description.
('50', 158, 3, 17, 255468) My satisfaction in regard to the Gandiv spinning wheel remains what it was; if anything, it has increased.
('50', 158, 3, 18, 255575) Read my letters to Mirabehn and Ishwarlal Vimawala on the subject.
('50', 158, 3, 19, 255642) The latter has written to me saying that he will send one more wheel to me too.
('50', 158, 3, 20, 255722) Pay him for it and for the wheels which may be received in the Ashram.
('50', 158, 3, 21, 255793) Send me your conclusions after you have tested the model.
('50', 158, 3, 22, 255851) Also send me the figures of the count, strength and evenness of Kakasahebs yarn received there.
('50', 158, 3, 23, 255947) Read what I have written in my letter to Maganbhai about the spindle bearer in use in Bardoli.
('50', 158, 3, 24, 256042) My own experience is that it is superior to the type fitted to the spinning wheel in use in the Ashram and in all other models.
('50', 158, 3, 25, 256170) If this is true, we should fit our spinning wheels with the same type of spindle bearer as they use in Bardoli.
('50', 158, 3, 26, 256282) If my judgment is wrong, I should be corrected.
('50', 158, 3, 27, 256330) If anyone prefers the type being used in the Ashram and if he has had experience of that being used in Bardoli, he may write to me about this matter.
('50', 158, 3, 28, 256480) It is my belief that even from the point of view of speed the Bardoli spindle bearer would ultimately be found superior to the others.
('50', 158, 3, 29, 256615) If I get the necessary facility, I will try to fit even the Gandiv spinning wheel with that type.
('50', 159, 0, 1, 256713) 160 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 159, 1, 2, 256755) I wrote to you last Friday about Amidas.
('50', 159, 1, 3, 256796) You must have received the letter.
('50', 159, 1, 4, 256831) I may even get your reply before this letter is posted.
('50', 159, 1, 5, 256887) Send me a wire if you have not received that letter.
('50', 159, 1, 6, 256940) I will then discuss the matter again.
('50', 159, 1, 7, 256978) October 20, 1930
('50', 159, 2, 8, 256995) Read my letter about Kanta.
('50', 159, 2, 9, 257023) It seems she wants to go out for a few days at least.
('50', 159, 2, 10, 257077) Think about the matter.
('50', 159, 2, 11, 257101) From here, what I feel is that she may go for a few days wherever she likes.
('50', 159, 2, 12, 257178) She is both truthful and brave.
('50', 159, 2, 13, 257210) She will be able to look after herself.
('50', 159, 2, 14, 257250) She will also keep any promise she makes.
('50', 159, 2, 15, 257292) This is my own experience, however.
('50', 159, 2, 16, 257328) You should do what you think best.
('50', 159, 2, 17, 257363) Find out what she wishes.
('50', 159, 2, 18, 257389) Tuesday morning, Diwali,
('50', 159, 3, 19, 257414) October 21, 1930 My blessings to all the friends there.
('50', 159, 3, 20, 257470) My Vandemataram and due regards to everyone.
('50', 159, 3, 21, 257515) May we be filled with greater spirit of service during the next year, and become fitter instruments and more awake to our duty in that regard.
('50', 159, 3, 22, 257658) We make frequent use of the word yajna.
('50', 159, 3, 23, 257698) We have raised spinning to the rank of a daily mahayajna.
('50', 159, 3, 24, 257756) It is therefore necessary to think out the various implications of the term yajna.
('50', 159, 3, 25, 257839) Yajna means an act directed to the welfare of others, done without desiring any return for it, whether of a temporal or spiritual nature.
('50', 159, 3, 26, 257977) Act here must be taken in its widest sense, and includes thought and word, as well as deed.
('50', 159, 3, 27, 258069) Others embraces not only humanity, but all life.
('50', 159, 3, 28, 258118) Therefore, and also from the standpoint of ahimsa, it is not a yajna to sacrifice lower animals even with a view to serving humanity.
('50', 159, 3, 29, 258252) It does not matter that animal sacrifice is supposed to find a place in the Vedas.
('50', 159, 3, 30, 258335) It is enough for us that such sacrifice cannot stand the fundamental tests of Truth and Non violence.
('50', 159, 3, 31, 258437) I readily admit my incompetence in Vedic scholarship.
('50', 159, 3, 32, 258491) But the incompetence, so far as this subject is concerned, does not worry me because, even if the practice of animal sacrifice be proved to have been a feature of Vedic society, it can form no precedent for a votary of ahimsa.
('50', 159, 3, 33, 258718) From this definition of yajna it follows that a primary sacrifice must be an act which conduces the most to the welfare of the greatest number in the widest area, and which can be performed by the largest number of men and women with the least trouble.
('50', 159, 3, 34, 258971) It will not, therefore, be a yajna, much less a mahayajna, to wish or to do ill to
('50', 160, 0, 1, 259054) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 161
('50', 160, 1, 2, 259099) anyone else even in order to serve a so called higher interest.
('50', 160, 1, 3, 259163) And the Gita teaches, and experience testifies, that all action that cannot come under the category of yajna promotes bondage.
('50', 160, 1, 4, 259290) The world cannot subsist for a single moment without yajna in this sense and, therefore, the Gita, after having dealt with true wisdom in the second chapter, takes up in the third the means of attaining it and declares in so many words that yajna came with Creation itself.
('50', 160, 1, 5, 259564) This body, therefore, has been given us only inorder that we may serve all Creation with it.
('50', 160, 1, 6, 259657) And therefore, says the Gita, he who eats without offering yajna eats stolen food.
('50', 160, 1, 7, 259740) Every single act of one who would lead a life of purity should be in the nature of yajna.
('50', 160, 1, 8, 259830) Yajna having come to us with our birth, we are debtors all our lives and thus for ever bound to serve the universe.
('50', 160, 1, 9, 259946) And even as a bondslave receives food, clothing and so on from the master whom he serves, so should we gratefully accept such gifts as may be assigned to us by the Lord of the universe.
('50', 160, 1, 10, 260132) What we receive must be called a gift; for as debtors we are entitled to no consideration for the discharge of our obligations.
('50', 160, 1, 11, 260260) Therefore we may not blame the Master if we fail to get it.
('50', 160, 1, 12, 260320) Our body is His to be cherished or cast away according to His will.
('50', 160, 1, 13, 260388) This is not a matter for complaint or even pity; on the contrary, it is a natural and even a pleasant and desirable state, if only we realize our proper place in Gods scheme.
('50', 160, 1, 14, 260563) We do indeed need strong faith, if we would experience this supreme bliss.
('50', 160, 1, 15, 260638) Do not worry in the least about yourself, leave all worry to God,this appears to be the commandment in all religions.
('50', 160, 1, 16, 260756) This need not frighten anyone.
('50', 160, 1, 17, 260787) He who devotes himself to service with a clear conscience will day by day grasp the necessity for it in greater measure and will continually grow richer in faith.
('50', 160, 1, 18, 260950) The path of service can hardly be trodden by one who is not prepared to renounce self interest and to recognize the conditions of his birth.
('50', 160, 1, 19, 261091) Any service rendered by such a person will be tainted by selfishness.
('50', 160, 1, 20, 261161) But, then, men of such utter selfishness are rare in this world.
('50', 160, 1, 21, 261226) Consciously or unconsciously, every one of us does render some service or other.
('50', 160, 1, 22, 261307) If we cultivate the habit of doing this service deliberately, our desire for service will steadily grow stronger and will make not only for our own happiness but also for that of the world at large.

('50', 162, 8, 25, 263507) Plaster may help a little.
('50', 162, 8, 26, 263534) The cause of the disease is inside the system.
('50', 162, 8, 27, 263581) This pain is a warning to you not to mind expense on fruit.
('50', 162, 8, 28, 263641) You should live mainly on milk and fruit.

('50', 164, 8, 17, 265587) Till Father wants you under his roof, you are better away from home.
('50', 164, 8, 18, 265656) I am sure mother will feel happy in the thought that you are doing well in body and mind.
('50', 164, 8, 19, 265746) At the same time you should shed all irritation against Father.
('50', 164, 8, 20, 265810) Do not count against him every remark he may make about you.
('50', 164, 8, 21, 265871) You must cultivate a big heart.
('50', 164, 8, 22, 265903) And then you will find that Father will be reconciled to you the sooner for your broad mindedness.
('50', 164, 8, 23, 266002) My love to you and Vidya.

('50', 165, 3, 5, 266317) I have found Nandlals booklet about spinning quite satisfactory.
('50', 165, 3, 6, 266382) There are of course mistakes in it.
('50', 165, 3, 7, 266418) I have pointed out some of them.
('50', 165, 3, 8, 266451) I am still corresponding with him.
('50', 165, 3, 9, 266486) He may be able to write if he makes more effort.
('50', 165, 3, 10, 266535) I do not think Prabhudas can write.
('50', 165, 3, 11, 266571) Krishna would be able to write better than him.
('50', 165, 3, 12, 266619) Prabhudas has not worked much with his hands.
('50', 165, 3, 13, 266665) Kaka (Kalelkar) would be arriving there within a month.
('50', 165, 3, 14, 266721) 1 It is being arranged that he should make a major contribution to it.

('50', 165, 8, 21, 266984) There is no reason why your weight should not increase now.
('50', 165, 8, 22, 267044) If you take exercise, keep your mind cheerful and masticate your food properly, it is bound to increase.
('50', 165, 8, 23, 267149) Never despair.
('50', 165, 8, 24, 267164) When you go out for a walk, run for some time.
('50', 165, 8, 25, 267211) While you do so, keep your mouth shut and breathe through nostrils.

('50', 166, 3, 4, 267489) BHAGWANJI, You ought to understand that one whose [own] mind is not integrated cannot weigh the merit or demerit of others.
('50', 166, 3, 5, 267613) I for one know Giriraj well.
('50', 166, 3, 6, 267642) He has lofty ideas but his strength to live up to them is very inadequate.
('50', 166, 3, 7, 267717) Yet I have hopes for him because he is always striving.
('50', 166, 3, 8, 267773) The aim of the Ashram is to insist on truth and on conduct conforming to truth.
('50', 166, 3, 9, 267853) Everything is organized with Truth as the focal point.
('50', 166, 3, 10, 267908) There are not many ideals in the world and there ought not to be.
('50', 166, 3, 11, 267974) The apparent manifold is only a golden lid hiding the Truth.
('50', 166, 4, 12, 268035) When it is removed we will see the One alone.

('50', 166, 9, 18, 268324) I have gone through the whole of the manuscript of your proposed book.
('50', 166, 9, 19, 268395) I liked it very much indeed.
('50', 166, 9, 20, 268424) I felt in it your overflowing love for the carding bow.
('50', 166, 9, 21, 268480) I was spell bound by the work and could not read it critically.
('50', 166, 9, 22, 268544) Now I shall get only a printed copy.
('50', 166, 9, 23, 268581) I will then read it critically and make suggestions, if I have any.
('50', 166, 9, 24, 268649) You advise rubbing [the string] with leaves even after it has been rubbed with candle wax.
('50', 166, 9, 25, 268740) Vithal says in his letter that if it has been rubbed with candle wax, nothing more is necessary.

('50', 167, 3, 5, 269085) Write to Rukhi and ask her to write to me.
('50', 167, 3, 6, 269128) What will Benarsi do in Kashi?
('50', 167, 3, 7, 269159) As the climate there is said to be very good, Rukhi is bound to keep good health there.
('50', 167, 3, 8, 269247) I have a letter from Navin, in which he declares his innocence.
('50', 167, 3, 9, 269311) See him and speak to him gently; tell him firmly what you know and of the truth of which you are convinced.
('50', 167, 3, 10, 269419) If Navin proves himself innocent and you find that you or Keshu had mistakenly thought him guilty, we should feel happy.
('50', 167, 3, 11, 269540) Investigate the matter in a perfectly detached spirit.
('50', 167, 3, 12, 269595) The matter is not light and should not be dropped.
('50', 167, 3, 13, 269646) Nor should you let your mind be exclusively occupied with it.
('50', 167, 3, 14, 269708) Your handwriting seems to me like a beautiful picture to look at.
('50', 167, 3, 15, 269774) This time your margin is not quite straight, and draws attention to itself, in contrast to the beauty of your handwriting, as a black particle of dust floating in milk does.

('50', 167, 8, 21, 270193) You must be capable of describing them.
('50', 167, 8, 22, 270233) A multitude of thoughts arise in the mind of a girl of your age.
('50', 167, 8, 23, 270298) The thoughts can be written down, but on one condition one must have the zeal and the concentration of mind for it.
('50', 167, 8, 24, 270414) If you maintain diary and note down everything, you can find from it the topics to write upon.

('50', 168, 9, 14, 271220) I attended to all the matters as you have put except the point where the mal should cross.
('50', 168, 9, 15, 271311) I do not know whether it crossed nearest the platform or away from it.
('50', 168, 9, 16, 271382) However I shall make another effort to see whether it works at all or not.
('50', 168, 9, 17, 271457) It ought at least to work.
('50', 168, 9, 18, 271484) Meanwhile the Gandiv continues to give much satisfaction.
('50', 168, 9, 19, 271542) It has not yet caused any trouble and did I tell you that it did not require the removal of the spindle after each days work.
('50', 168, 9, 20, 271668) After the work, it is hung up on the wall.
('50', 168, 9, 21, 271711) It thus requires no attention every morning as all the other wheels do.
('50', 168, 9, 22, 271783) And the more I work it, the greater becomes the conviction that it is capable of giving as much output as any single wheel.
('50', 168, 9, 23, 271907) I have got the scales now.
('50', 168, 9, 24, 271934) I seem to spin 24 counts and over and my highest speed is 200 rounds, very considerable improvement on the box wheel.

('50', 169, 1, 4, 272301) I am glad you are not going to tour just now.
('50', 169, 1, 5, 272347) You should build up your body anew.

('50', 170, 6, 11, 273960) How did you fall ill?
('50', 170, 6, 12, 273982) Whenever you have no appetite, you should fast.
('50', 170, 6, 13, 274030) It does not matter if you feel weaker.
('50', 170, 6, 14, 274069) That weakness will not be real.
('50', 170, 6, 15, 274101) If you cannot fast completely, you may eat fresh fruits like grapes, oranges, etc., but nothing else, and take an enema every day to clear the bowels.
('50', 170, 6, 16, 274252) You should take care and preserve your health.

('50', 172, 7, 15, 276242) October 26, 1930
('50', 172, 8, 16, 276259) KALAVATI, Kashinath sends some extracts from your letters.
('50', 172, 8, 17, 276318) I see from them that you are extremely disturbed.
('50', 172, 8, 18, 276368) There is nothing like perturbation for those who are devoted to duty in a detached manner.
('50', 172, 8, 19, 276459) One who has consecrated all to God has no occasion for agitation.
('50', 172, 8, 20, 276525) There is no possibility of any harm resulting from Jijis 1 exertions due to grinding.

('50', 173, 3, 4, 276797) SHANTA, Kashinath writes that you are expecting a letter from me.
('50', 173, 3, 5, 276863) I had no idea that any letter was still unanswered.
('50', 173, 3, 6, 276915) I am glad to learn that you are keeping well and devoting your time to various tasks.
('50', 173, 3, 7, 277001) All are conscious of the gains directly derived from the Ashram, but the devotees of Truth know that their unseen gain is immensely greater than what is obvious.
('50', 173, 3, 8, 277163) I wish you could realize this.

('50', 174, 8, 12, 277907) PRABHAVATI, You have become very nervous.
('50', 174, 8, 13, 277949) But you have no reason for it.
('50', 174, 8, 14, 277980) If now the burden of running the home has fallen on you, you are strong enough for that.
('50', 174, 8, 15, 278069) If the responsibility is yours, you ought to have the corresponding rights too.
('50', 174, 8, 16, 278149) You can manage your home as it seems best to you.
('50', 174, 8, 17, 278199) Jayaprakash will certainly help you in that.
('50', 174, 8, 18, 278244) You may talk about everything with your father in law with the freedom of a daughter.
('50', 174, 8, 19, 278330) At first he will feel embarrassed but by and by you will see that he, too, will talk freely with you and remove the difficulties from your path.
('50', 174, 8, 20, 278475) Moreover, you have servants to help you.
('50', 174, 8, 21, 278516) You should take due care of your health while looking after the affairs of the home.
('50', 174, 8, 22, 278601) Do not work beyond your strength.
('50', 174, 8, 23, 278635) Save some time for reading, for going out for a walk and resting, and make yours a model home.
('50', 174, 8, 24, 278730) It will be a problem for you only if you do not have full authority to do what you wish to do.
('50', 174, 8, 25, 278825) But I simply cannot believe at the moment that you will not get such authority.
('50', 174, 8, 26, 278905) Have confidence in yourself.
('50', 174, 8, 27, 278934) Learn to be firm.

('50', 175, 6, 10, 279400) BHAISHRI BHAGWANJI, I got your letter.
('50', 175, 6, 11, 279439) I felt unhappy on reading the news about Bhai Revashanker.
('50', 175, 6, 12, 279498) His simplicity was indeed as you describe it to be.
('50', 175, 6, 13, 279550) I have no doubt that his soul rests in peace.
('50', 175, 6, 14, 279596) I send with this a letter to Devchandbhai in regard to Sudarshan, but what more can I do from here in this matter?
('50', 175, 6, 15, 279711) I am very much pained to know what you say about Bhai Narbheram.
('50', 175, 6, 16, 279776) It would give me a great shock to believe that he could be dishonest.
('50', 175, 6, 17, 279846) My advice regarding him is that you should suggest to him to let an arbitrator examine the claim against him and give his decision.
('50', 175, 6, 18, 279978) If he does not agree, you should put up with the loss.
('50', 175, 6, 19, 280033) I would not advise you to take the matter to a court of law.
('50', 175, 6, 20, 280094) The prestige which the Bank of England enjoys in London, or rather in the whole world, is enjoyed by Kars [anji] Moolchand in our small world of Rajkot.
('50', 175, 6, 21, 280247) In their respective spheres, they enjoy equal prestige.
('50', 175, 6, 22, 280303) I should very much like that prestige to be re established.
('50', 175, 6, 23, 280363) You should certainly not fight [in a court].
('50', 175, 6, 24, 280408) Money is not the only important thing in life.

('50', 176, 3, 5, 280750) I shall know tomorrow whether you got the wire which I have sent today on behalf of us both.
('50', 176, 3, 6, 280843) I know that you have a strong mind and I need not, therefore, try to give you courage.
('50', 176, 3, 7, 280930) Such illnesses also test us.
('50', 176, 3, 8, 280959) We should not think that we shall always be happy because we believe in God.
('50', 176, 3, 9, 281036) However, both Kakasaheb and I feel sure that Manu is safe.
('50', 176, 3, 10, 281095) It is Gods will that he should serve Him in this very body.
('50', 176, 3, 11, 281155) As long as the illness remains serious, send me news daily.
('50', 176, 3, 12, 281215) I believe it will be possible to arrange so that I get your message every day.

('50', 177, 3, 7, 281979) I have never seen him after I met him in Deolali.

('50', 177, 8, 19, 282614) 2 It is possible you will find in it the key to understanding the spirit of service.
('50', 177, 8, 20, 282699) This time too I am going to elaborate on the same theme.
('50', 177, 8, 21, 282756) Think seriously about it.

('50', 178, 3, 4, 283258) SHANKERLAL, I have received your letter; also Anasuyabehns.
('50', 178, 3, 5, 283318) We do not know when our real New Year starts.
('50', 178, 3, 6, 283364) Or shall we say that it has started on the 12th March?
('50', 178, 3, 7, 283419) For the time being, I am spinning on a takli.
('50', 178, 3, 8, 283465) But I do not like such a slow speed.
('50', 178, 3, 9, 283502) In Wardha they spin 132 rounds in half an hour.
('50', 178, 3, 10, 283550) 80 rounds are quite common.
('50', 178, 3, 11, 283578) if you have people who are experts in spinning on the takli, let them write to me about that art of spinning.
('50', 178, 3, 12, 283688) I have of course asked for the instructions from Wardha.
('50', 178, 3, 13, 283745) Instructions from two or three places would be more than sufficient.
('50', 178, 3, 14, 283814) I have acquired good speed in spinning on the charkha.
('50', 178, 3, 15, 283869) I think I can still improve.
('50', 178, 3, 16, 283898) This is the second urgent letter to you.

('50', 178, 8, 22, 284133) NARANDAS, Your packet was given to me on Wednesday (yesterday) in two parts.
('50', 178, 8, 23, 284210) It was divided into two parts by the authorities here.
('50', 178, 8, 24, 284265) Let me know when and in what condition you received the packet which was dispatched from here on the 21st.
('50', 178, 8, 25, 284372) It is enough for me that you do not feel it as a burden to have to handle my correspondence.
('50', 178, 8, 26, 284465) So long as they let me, I shall continue to write as I have been doing.
('50', 178, 8, 27, 284537) Give me whatever news you get about Amidas.
('50', 178, 8, 28, 284581) If you have any comments to make about my views concerning eggs, please do.
('50', 178, 8, 29, 284657) I know definitely that Pyarelal has not been transferred to Nasik.
('50', 178, 8, 30, 284724) We shall meet again in a day or two.
('50', 178, 8, 31, 284761) Ascertain the position about Chitalia and pay him any sum you think proper.
('50', 178, 8, 32, 284837) We should not refuse to help him to face his difficulties.
('50', 178, 8, 33, 284896) Did you ask Chhaganlal Joshi?
('50', 178, 8, 34, 284926) He may, perhaps, have
('50', 179, 0, 1, 284948) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 179, 1, 2, 284990) kept a note somewhere.
('50', 179, 1, 3, 285013) Does he not live next to you?
('50', 179, 1, 4, 285043) Also let me know how he is.
('50', 179, 1, 5, 285071) I am glad that Mirabehn has for the present dropped her idea of going out of the Ashram.
('50', 179, 1, 6, 285160) I have had no letter from Devdas, whether long or short.
('50', 179, 1, 7, 285217) Did he send it directly from jail, or in some other manner?
('50', 179, 1, 8, 285277) I will inquire about it here after I hear from you.
('50', 179, 1, 9, 285329) Ask Jivarambhai to write to me.
('50', 179, 1, 10, 285361) There was a note by Chandrakanta to the effect that a letter by Kumarappa was included, but there was no such letter.
('50', 179, 1, 11, 285479) Instead, there was a letter from the Rev.
('50', 179, 1, 12, 285521) Holmes.
('50', 179, 1, 13, 285529) It is addressed C/o Kumarappa.
('50', 179, 1, 14, 285560) Kakasaheb thinks that that made Kanta say that there was a letter from Kumarappa.
('50', 179, 1, 15, 285642) Manilal has asked me for suggestions for reading.
('50', 179, 1, 16, 285692) I must have gone to sleep with this thought in my mind, and so I had the following dream.
('50', 179, 1, 17, 285782) My advice for reading is as in the dream which I am narrating.
('50', 179, 1, 18, 285845) I dreamt that Manilal was standing by my side and that Devdas, a child, had climbed on to my lap and had fallen asleep.
('50', 179, 1, 19, 285965) Manilal told me that he had wasted many years of his life without reading anything and that the desire for reading had now awakened in him.
('50', 179, 1, 20, 286105) He, therefore, asked me to guide him.
('50', 179, 1, 21, 286143) I expressed my regret that I had not been able to do much for my childrens education.
('50', 179, 1, 22, 286229) I then wrote down as follows for Manilal: Study the whole of Gokhales book on arithmetic.
('50', 179, 1, 23, 286319) Study his books on algebra and geometry too, if you get time.
('50', 179, 1, 24, 286381) You should learn the history and geography of India in some detail, and of the world in outline.
('50', 179, 1, 25, 286478) You should read Tolstoys The Kingdom of God Is within You, for Sanskrit Bhandarkars books and the Gita, in Gujarati Navajivanmala and Ks 1 Jivanshodhan, and finally Tulsidass Ramayana and a text on.
('50', 179, 1, 26, 286677) arithmetic, both in Gujarati.
('50', 179, 1, 27, 286707) You should get the books through Maganbhai. At this point I woke up from the dream.
('50', 179, 1, 28, 286791) There was something more still, but I do not recollect it.
('50', 179, 1, 29, 286850) That is, I had forgotten it even when I woke up at 3.30 a.m.
('50', 179, 1, 30, 286911) I like the advice I gave in my dream.
('50', 179, 1, 31, 286949) Manilal may read what he can, and what he finds interesting, from the above.
('50', 179, 1, 32, 287026) Or, rather, it is Mahadev who has awakened Manilals interest in reading.
('50', 179, 1, 33, 287099) He should, therefore, be guided by Mahadev.
('50', 179, 1, 34, 287143) I should not hold on to an opinion expressed in a dream; and, moreover, I cannot at present think out a reading list for Manilal.
('50', 179, 1, 35, 287273) I would give the same advice to Ramdas.
('50', 179, 1, 36, 287313) I attach no importance at all to the dream.
('50', 179, 1, 37, 287357) Manilals problem was in my mind.
('50', 179, 1, 38, 287390) I had also been thinking about Devdass letter.
('50', 179, 1, 39, 287437) It is not, therefore, surprising that, owing to some disturbance in the stomach, I
('50', 179, 2, 40, 287520) 1 K. G. Mashruwalas
('50', 180, 0, 1, 287540) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 181
('50', 180, 1, 2, 287585) got such a happy dream.
('50', 180, 1, 3, 287609) Write to Brijkrishna and tell him that the understanding is that, as far as possible, I should not write to prisoners and hence I do not write to him.
('50', 180, 1, 4, 287760) I think about him every day, all the same.
('50', 180, 1, 5, 287803) Tell him that he should take the utmost care of his health.
('50', 180, 1, 6, 287863) He should make the best use of every minute and keep note of how hespends his time.
('50', 180, 1, 7, 287947) Let him take this as a letter to him.
('50', 180, 1, 8, 287985) And he should continue to write to me.
('50', 180, 2, 9, 288024) Tuesday morning, October 28, 1930
('50', 180, 3, 10, 288058) I wrote about yajna last week, but feel like writing more about it.
('50', 180, 3, 11, 288126) It will perhaps be worthwhile further to consider a principle which has been created along with mankind.
('50', 180, 3, 12, 288231) Yajna is duty to be performed, or service to be rendered, all the twenty four hours of the day, and hence a maxim like The powers of the good are always exercised for a benevolent purpose is inappropriate, if benevolence has any taste of favour about it.
('50', 180, 3, 13, 288486) To serve without desire is to favour not others, but ourselves even as in discharging a debt we serve only ourselves, lighten our burden and fulfil our duty.
('50', 180, 3, 14, 288644) Again, not only the good, but all of us are bound to place our resources at the disposal of humanity.
('50', 180, 3, 15, 288746) And if such is the law, as evidently it is, indulgence ceases to hold a place in life and gives way to renunciation.
('50', 180, 3, 16, 288863) For human beings renunciation itself is enjoyment.
('50', 180, 3, 17, 288914) This is what differentiates man from the beast.
('50', 180, 3, 18, 288962) Some object that life thus understood becomes dull and devoid of art, and leaves no room for the householder.
('50', 180, 3, 19, 289072) But I think in saying this they misinterpret the word renunciation.
('50', 180, 3, 20, 289140) Renunciation here does not mean abandoning the world and retiring into the forest.
('50', 180, 3, 21, 289223) The spirit of renunciation, should rule all the activities of life.
('50', 180, 3, 22, 289291) A householder does not cease to be one if he regards life as a duty rather than as an indulgence.
('50', 180, 3, 23, 289389) A cobbler, a cultivator, a tradesman or a barber may be inspired in their work or activities either by the spirit of renunciation or merely by the desire for self indulgence.
('50', 180, 3, 24, 289564) A merchant who carries on his business in a spirit of sacrifice will have crores passing through his hands, but he will, if he follows the law, use his abilities for service.
('50', 180, 3, 25, 289739) He will, therefore, not cheat or speculate, will lead a simple life, will not injure a living soul and will lose millions rather than harm anybody.
('50', 180, 3, 26, 289887) Let no one run away with the idea that this type of merchant exists only in my imagination.
('50', 180, 3, 27, 289979) Fortunately for the world, he does exist in the West as well as in the East.
('50', 180, 3, 28, 290056) It is true such merchants may be counted on ones fingers but the type ceases to be
('50', 181, 0, 1, 290139) 182 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 181, 1, 2, 290181) imaginary as soon as even one living specimen can be found to answer to it.
('50', 181, 1, 3, 290257) All of us know of a philanthropic tailor in Wadhwan.
('50', 181, 1, 4, 290310) I know of one such barber.
('50', 181, 1, 5, 290337) Everyone of us knows of such a weaver.
('50', 181, 2, 6, 290376) And if we go deeply into the matter, we shall come across men in every walk of life who lead dedicated lives.
('50', 181, 2, 7, 290486) No doubt these sacrificers obtain their livelihood by their work.
('50', 181, 2, 8, 290552) But livelihood is not their objective, but only a by product of their vocation.
('50', 181, 2, 9, 290632) Motilal was a tailor at first, and continued as a tailor afterwards.
('50', 181, 2, 10, 290701) But his spirit was changed and his work was transmuted into worship.
('50', 181, 2, 11, 290770) He began to think about the welfare of others and his life became artistic in the real sense of the term.
('50', 181, 2, 12, 290876) A life of sacrifice is the pinnacle of art and is full of true joy.
('50', 181, 2, 13, 290944) Such life is the source of ever fresh springs of joy which never dry up and never satiate.
('50', 181, 2, 14, 291035) Yajna is not yajna if one feels it to be burdensome or annoying.
('50', 181, 2, 15, 291100) Self indulgence leads to destruction and renunciation to immortality.
('50', 181, 2, 16, 291170) Joy has no independent existence.
('50', 181, 2, 17, 291204) It depends upon our attitude to life.
('50', 181, 2, 18, 291242) One man will enjoy theatrical scenery, another the ever new scenes which unfold themselves in the sky.
('50', 181, 2, 19, 291345) Joy, therefore, is a matter of education.
('50', 181, 2, 20, 291387) We shall delight in things which we have been taught to delight in as children.
('50', 181, 2, 21, 291467) And illustrations can be easily cited of different national tastes.
('50', 181, 2, 22, 291535) Again, many sacrificers imagine that they are free to receive from the people everything they need and many things they do not need, because they are rendering disinterested service.
('50', 181, 2, 23, 291718) Directly this idea sways a man, he ceases to be a servant and becomes a tyrant over the people.
('50', 181, 2, 24, 291814) One who would serve others will not waste a thought upon his own comforts, which he leaves to be attended to or neglected by his Master on high.
('50', 181, 2, 25, 291959) He will not, therefore, encumber himself with everything that comes his way; he will take only what he strictly needs and leave the rest.
('50', 181, 2, 26, 292097) He will be calm, free from anger and unruffled in mind even if he finds himself inconvenienced.
('50', 181, 2, 27, 292193) His service, like virtue, is its own reward, and he will rest content with it.
('50', 181, 2, 28, 292272) Again, one dare not be negligent in service or be behindhand with it.
('50', 181, 2, 29, 292342) He who thinks that he must be diligent only in his personal business and unpaid public business may be done in any way and at

('50', 182, 1, 3, 292638) Voluntary service of others demands the best of which one is capable, and must take precedence over service of self.
('50', 182, 1, 4, 292755) In fact, the pure devotee consecrates himself to the service of humanity without any reservation whatever.
('50', 182, 2, 5, 292862) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] The person in the Ashram who spins best on the takli should write to me and explain how he spins, how he imparts spinning motion to the takli, what is the length of the thread which he draws out at one time, etc.

('50', 182, 2, 7, 293160) Trivedi has sent me a pair of scales, and, therefore, you need not send one from there.

('50', 182, 6, 12, 293381) DEAR SISTER, The stock of uncarded cotton with me is about to be exhausted.
('50', 182, 6, 13, 293457) Till now, I used to get it from the Ashram.
('50', 182, 6, 14, 293501) This time may I trouble you?
('50', 182, 6, 15, 293530) My hope in making this request is that, if you do not keep a stock of such cotton, you will start doing so.
('50', 182, 6, 16, 293638) The cotton should have been ginned by hand.
('50', 182, 6, 17, 293682) It is difficult to card with hand the cotton from the bales prepared in a ginning press, and the yarn spun from such cotton is not of good quality.
('50', 182, 6, 18, 293830) If you do not keep a stock of such cotton ginned by hand, you may obtain some from the Ashram or from Vithaldas Jerajani.
('50', 182, 6, 19, 293952) It may also be available in the Khadi Karyalaya.
('50', 182, 6, 20, 294001) I make this request so that you may take all this trouble.

('50', 183, 3, 8, 294628) I can understand that you have to devote a great deal of your time to your business, but being engrossed in it all the time will neither profit the business nor bring you peace of mind.

('50', 183, 8, 16, 295236) DEAR SISTER, You sent me the cotton by return of post!
('50', 183, 8, 17, 295291) It is of very good quality indeed.
('50', 183, 8, 18, 295326) I had forgotten to mention the quantity required.
('50', 183, 8, 19, 295376) You guessed it correctly.

('50', 185, 7, 13, 297730) You seem to me to misunderstand my meaning.
('50', 185, 7, 14, 297774) No fault of yours.
('50', 185, 7, 15, 297793) You have not the original before you.
('50', 185, 7, 16, 297831) I have not seen the translation.
('50', 185, 7, 17, 297864) The word vow is also an unsuitable equivalent for the original ozr.
('50', 185, 7, 18, 297932) But the best thing for me is to explain what I mean and then leave you to find the exact word if you endorse my position.
('50', 185, 7, 19, 298054) If you contest it, you should continue the correspondence till we have thrashed the subject out.
('50', 185, 7, 20, 298151) You seem to think of vows publicly administered to audiences.
('50', 185, 7, 21, 298213) This may or may not be good.
('50', 185, 7, 22, 298242) The vow I am thinking of is a promise made by one to oneself.

('50', 185, 7, 24, 298403) The one binds us to make us really free, the other only appears to free us so as to bind us tight within his grip.

('50', 187, 3, 4, 300548) PRABHAVATI, I have both your letters, the one which you wrote directly and the one which you sent through the Ashram.
('50', 187, 3, 5, 300666) All this nervousness doesnt become you.
('50', 187, 3, 6, 300706) Learn to endure the misfortune which has befallen you.
('50', 187, 3, 7, 300761) If your health does not recover there you must go to the Ashram.
('50', 187, 3, 8, 300826) After your health has improved, you may again assume the responsibility of running the home.
('50', 187, 3, 9, 300919) With weak health, what can you do even if you remain there?
('50', 187, 3, 10, 300979) I simply cannot understand why you should get fainting fits.
('50', 187, 3, 11, 301040) It seems you fret too much.
('50', 187, 3, 12, 301068) Stop doing so.
('50', 187, 3, 13, 301083) Have faith in God.
('50', 187, 3, 14, 301102) Let His will be done.
('50', 187, 3, 15, 301124) We are mere puppets in His hands.
('50', 187, 3, 16, 301158) For some time, you should drop me a postcard every day.

('50', 187, 3, 18, 301237) I have written to Jayaprakash.
('50', 187, 3, 19, 301268) If he shows the letterto you and and wishes to discuss the matter with you, advise him as you think proper.
('50', 187, 3, 20, 301376) Give up all worries.
('50', 187, 3, 21, 301397) You may freely write to me anything you wish to.
('50', 187, 3, 22, 301446) I dont know why you did not get my postcard.

('50', 187, 8, 28, 301664) BHAI GHANSHYAMDASJI, This letter concerns Bhai Jayaprakash Narayan.
('50', 187, 8, 29, 301732) He belongs to a respectable family of Bihar and he is also the son in law of Brijkishore Babu, the noble worker of Bihar.
('50', 187, 8, 30, 301854) Till now he was with Jawaharlal in the Congress office.
('50', 187, 8, 31, 301910) He has studied in America for seven years.
('50', 187, 8, 32, 301953) Now, after his mothers death, he feels the necessity of earning some money.
('50', 187, 8, 33, 302029) He needs Rs. 300 per mensem.
('50', 187, 8, 34, 302058) In my opinion, Bhai Jayaprakash is a worthy young man.
('50', 187, 8, 35, 302113) If possible, absorb him

('50', 188, 1, 3, 302222) Bhai Jayaprakash will himself give you further details about his antecedents.
('50', 188, 1, 4, 302300) 1 I know Babu Brijkishores daughter 2 very well.
('50', 188, 1, 5, 302349) She has lived in the Ashram for a considerable time.
('50', 188, 1, 6, 302402) I have rarely seen a girl like her, resolute and utterly devoted to duty.
('50', 188, 2, 7, 302476) Yours, MOHANDAS

('50', 188, 5, 10, 302572) YERAVDA MANDIR, November 1, 1930
('50', 188, 6, 11, 302605) JAYAPRAKASH, I have your letter.
('50', 188, 6, 12, 302638) I am glad.
('50', 188, 6, 13, 302649) You are entitled to write as you do.
('50', 188, 6, 14, 302686) Your grief moves me.
('50', 188, 6, 15, 302707) Your love for your mother 3 is commendable and becomes you.
('50', 188, 6, 16, 302767) I enclose a letter to G.D. Birla.
('50', 188, 6, 17, 302801) 4 Take it to him and see him.
('50', 188, 6, 18, 302831) However, I must caution you.
('50', 188, 6, 19, 302860) I myself have drunk deep from the fountain of motherly love.
('50', 188, 6, 20, 302921) I was devoted to my parents; I worshipped them.
('50', 188, 6, 21, 302969) And yet in your love for your mother I see attachment.
('50', 188, 6, 22, 303024) Your love should be informed with knowledge.Your mother has died in the body.
('50', 188, 6, 23, 303102) Her spirit has not perished.
('50', 188, 6, 24, 303131) The body had to perish one day.
('50', 188, 6, 25, 303163) Your love should now undergo a transformation.
('50', 188, 6, 26, 303210) Our true mother is the motherland.
('50', 188, 6, 27, 303245) Your filial love should be transformed into love of the motherland and to make it endure you should dedicate yourself to the service of the motherland.
('50', 188, 6, 28, 303397) You must not distress yourself that an expert doctor was not called.
('50', 188, 6, 29, 303466) Millions of mothers get no medical assistance.
('50', 188, 6, 30, 303513) And I cannot admit that they are thereby necessarily the losers.
('50', 188, 6, 31, 303578) Even the best of doctors cannot confer immortality on anyone.
('50', 188, 6, 32, 303640) Therefore, in my view you and everyone else should give expression to your filial love by dwelling on the virtues of the departed and emulating them and you should devote all your energies for the cause of the motherland.
('50', 188, 7, 33, 303862) 1 The letter from Jayaprakash Narayan was enclosed with this letter.

('50', 189, 1, 3, 304145) If what I say appeals to you show this to your father and seek his consent for dedicating yourself to the work of service.
('50', 189, 1, 4, 304268) Of course you had already made such a dedication.
('50', 189, 1, 5, 304318) But the death of your mother has created a new situation and reconsideration may be the duty.
('50', 189, 1, 6, 304412) However, if my advice does not appeal to you, you may use the letter to Ghanshyamdasji and earnestly try to earn a livelihood.
('50', 189, 1, 7, 304539) I shall not be distressed thereby.
('50', 189, 1, 8, 304574) Consult Prabhavati also.
('50', 189, 1, 9, 304599) Keep writing to me and if at any time you need my help let me know.

('50', 189, 6, 17, 304926) If Shanta has been trying the bath cure, let me know the effect it has.
('50', 189, 6, 18, 304998) We had two copies of Kuhnes book.
('50', 189, 6, 19, 305032) I think there is a Gujarati translation also.
('50', 189, 6, 20, 305078) Kalavati had good experience of life at home and it is also to the good that she is now returning of her own accord.
('50', 189, 6, 21, 305195) Rukminis suicide excites deep pity.
('50', 189, 6, 22, 305231) I think that there must have been some other cause also behind this suicide.
('50', 189, 6, 23, 305308) Has anybody investigated the matter further?
('50', 189, 6, 24, 305353) Has not the womens group discussed it?
('50', 189, 6, 25, 305392) As the place is near Godhra, Mama is likely to know something.
('50', 189, 6, 26, 305455) If the report is correct, there should be widespread public agitation about the case.
('50', 189, 6, 27, 305541) If you get time, inquire further and let me know the result.
('50', 189, 6, 28, 305602) Who is the writer of the original letter?
('50', 189, 6, 29, 305644) You cannot send me the Kashi newspaper.

('50', 190, 2, 3, 305879) November 2, 1930
('50', 190, 3, 4, 305896) RADHIKA, I have your letter.
('50', 190, 3, 5, 305925) Read mine over and over and go on asking me about what you do not understand in it.
('50', 190, 3, 6, 306009) I preserve both my self respect and humility if, when someone kicks me and tries to force me to salute him, I suffer the kicks but do not get angry and wish well of the person kicking me, do not utter even one word in reply and still refuse to salute him.
('50', 190, 3, 7, 306265) Once a person kicked me and tried to force me to sit at his feet, but I said nothing to him, never wished him ill even in a dream, and yet refused to sit at his feet.
('50', 190, 3, 8, 306432) I believe I had preserved both self respect and humility.
('50', 190, 3, 9, 306490) When the incident took place, I was notat all conscious that I was being humble or anything of the sort.
('50', 190, 3, 10, 306595) I narrate it now only in order to explain my meaning.
('50', 190, 3, 11, 306649) You can think of many similar situations.
('50', 190, 3, 12, 306691) You may even recall some from your own life, and it would be very good indeed if one formed the habit, and learnt the art, of reflecting on such incidents in ones own life rather than in anothers.
('50', 190, 3, 13, 306888) In doing so, one should not search for incidents in ones life which show ones own virtues.
('50', 190, 3, 14, 306979) Our virtues are for others to see.
('50', 190, 3, 15, 307014) We should try to discover our shortcomings.
('50', 190, 4, 16, 307058) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] It is also humility to see ones own shortcomings.

('50', 191, 8, 16, 307904) Those who regard even death as Gods favour ultimately stand to gain.
('50', 191, 8, 17, 307973) You too are benefiting thus.

('50', 191, 8, 20, 308082) And I expect this from all women.
('50', 191, 8, 21, 308116) Womans capacity is in no way inferior to mans for Gods work, but, in ahimsa and the like, it is definitely superior.
('50', 191, 8, 22, 308233) The description of Tarinis shraddha is enlightening.

('50', 192, 8, 15, 308985) Manu has survived a real danger to his life.
('50', 192, 8, 16, 309030) From this we should believe that he is destined for some great achievement.
('50', 192, 8, 17, 309106) At any rate such are the qualities of character we observe in him at present.

('50', 193, 8, 17, 310650) PANNALAL, It is a good question you have raised.
('50', 193, 8, 18, 310699) Exactly the same question was raised formerly regarding Andhra.
('50', 193, 8, 19, 310763) The decision arrived at in the end was that we at any rate should try to produce in Gujarat the khadi required for Gujarat.
('50', 193, 8, 20, 310887) The same thing applies in the case of the Punjab.
('50', 193, 8, 21, 310937) The principle of local production is the very basis of the khadi movement.
('50', 193, 8, 22, 311012) Every province, every district and in fact every village should produce the khadi which it needs.
('50', 193, 8, 23, 311110) In the final analysis, the difference in price between khadi and other cloth does not count.
('50', 193, 8, 24, 311203) Khadi will be dearer than mill cloth if people, though they understand the principles of economics, do not spin to meet their own requirements; if, none the less, they wear it for the sake of the poor,
('50', 194, 0, 1, 311405) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 195
('50', 194, 1, 2, 311450) they would find khadi cheaper in the long run than other cloth.
('50', 194, 1, 3, 311514) Think over my definition of swadeshi.
('50', 194, 1, 4, 311552) We have only one way open to us to meet the difficulties which we now experience, and that is, to decide the principle and then cling to it.
('50', 194, 1, 5, 311693) For all that, private dealers are sure to order khadi from the Punjab or other places.
('50', 194, 1, 6, 311780) We will not obstruct them.
('50', 194, 1, 7, 311807) If you do not understand why this is the right course, you may ask me again.

('50', 194, 6, 13, 312091) He has now completely recovered.
('50', 194, 6, 14, 312124) He has got back his original weight.
('50', 194, 6, 15, 312161) He drinks three pounds of milk and eats one pound of bread.
('50', 194, 6, 16, 312221) When he wants, he eats vegetables too.

('50', 194, 11, 22, 312431) PREMA, If you have symptoms of jaundice and get acid eructations, I am sure what you should do is to fast for at least seven days.
('50', 194, 11, 23, 312562) While you are fasting, you should drink every day at least four pounds of water, mixing soda bicarb and/or salt with it.
('50', 194, 11, 24, 312683) You should break the fast with fruit juice and then start whey and rice in required quantities.

('50', 195, 11, 19, 313693) You have said thrice in your short letter, I cant think what to write. If you write slowly, as if you were practising in a copy book, you would certainly be able to write a good hand.
('50', 195, 11, 20, 313877) You who have some work or other to do during the whole day, why cant you think of anything to write about?
('50', 195, 11, 21, 313984) It is natural that you wish to meet me.

('50', 196, 13, 25, 315066) Some errors in expression there are, but they do not matter.
('50', 196, 13, 26, 315127) You must cultivate the habit of revising the letter.
('50', 196, 13, 27, 315180) Some errors can thus be corrected.
('50', 196, 13, 28, 315215) It is preferable to brush the teeth before prayers.

('50', 197, 4, 8, 315684) October 30/ November 4, 1930
('50', 197, 5, 9, 315713) NARANDAS, I got your packet today.
('50', 197, 5, 10, 315748) The piece of leather which you sent for the sandals was not good enough for repairing the soles.
('50', 197, 5, 11, 315845) It is hardly a month since the repair was done but the soles have again worn out.
('50', 197, 5, 12, 315927) The hard leather required for soles and heels is made from hide of a particular part of the body, generally of a buffalo.
('50', 197, 5, 13, 316049) If you get such a piece, send it to me.
('50', 197, 5, 14, 316089) In the alternative, you may send another pair of the same number as, or of a number higher than, the one you sent for Kakasaheb.
('50', 197, 5, 15, 316218) I think I wrote to you that you need not send the pair of scales.
('50', 197, 5, 16, 316284) If I did not, please understand from this that I dont need it.
('50', 197, 5, 17, 316347) Trivedi came and gave me one.
('50', 197, 5, 18, 316377) I know your attitude.
('50', 197, 5, 19, 316399) So long as Mahadev is outside, you will not take upon yourself the burden of making a final decision, and you are right in that.
('50', 197, 5, 20, 316528) I had a long letter from Keshu.
('50', 197, 5, 21, 316560) He seems to have been deeply hurt.
('50', 197, 5, 22, 316595) He has bitterly complained against you, but his letter has had no effect on me.
('50', 197, 5, 23, 316675) You should, however, take him into confidence and ask him to tell you all that he feels.
('50', 197, 5, 24, 316764) I know that he is impulsive by nature.
('50', 197, 5, 25, 316803) But he is a sincere youth and very eager to do service.
('50', 197, 5, 26, 316859) He is, however, impatient to increase his knowledge and do original work.
('50', 197, 5, 27, 316933) I may be wrong in my judgment about him.
('50', 197, 5, 28, 316974) You should, however, call him and hear all that he has to say.
('50', 197, 5, 29, 317037) Afterwards write to me and give me the impression you form.

('50', 198, 1, 2, 317189) spends money rather freely.
('50', 198, 1, 3, 317217) But I have observed that, in spite of that, he is simple in habits.
('50', 198, 1, 4, 317285) He adheres to his charge against .
('50', 198, 1, 5, 317320) 1 and it is a serious one.
('50', 198, 1, 6, 317347) We need have no fears about Kanta and Sumangal.
('50', 198, 1, 7, 317395) They are close relations.
('50', 198, 1, 8, 317421) They are first cousins and have grown up together.
('50', 198, 1, 9, 317472) Despite this, I, too, had a suspicion and expressed it to them.
('50', 198, 1, 10, 317536) But I felt that they were innocent.
('50', 198, 1, 11, 317572) Sumangal was Kantas teacher once and she has great faith in him.
('50', 198, 1, 12, 317637) And, moreover, if we suspect brothers and sisters, where would we end?
('50', 198, 1, 13, 317708) We have adopted an attitude of full trust in the women.
('50', 198, 1, 14, 317764) If we burn our fingers as a result of that, we will endure our misfortune.
('50', 198, 1, 15, 317839) Unless we are prepared to take some risks, we shall fail to do our duty towards women.
('50', 198, 1, 16, 317926) The Hindu man is under a heavy debt to the Hindu woman.
('50', 198, 1, 17, 317982) October 31, 1930
('50', 198, 2, 18, 317999) The clock struck nine when I wrote the last sentence and I laid down the pen.
('50', 198, 2, 19, 318077) We have resolved not to work after nine, as far as possible.
('50', 198, 2, 20, 318138) I got your letter about Amidas.
('50', 198, 2, 21, 318170) I am satisfied now.
('50', 198, 2, 22, 318190) His firmness will be rewarded.
('50', 198, 2, 23, 318221) I felt that it was my duty to tell him what I knew.
('50', 198, 2, 24, 318273) If you want me to decide about Chitalia, I suggest that you should send him Rs. 1,500. I think my speech referred to the past but made no reference to the future.
('50', 198, 2, 25, 318436) He cannot claim any money on the basis of that speech.
('50', 198, 2, 26, 318491) But I do not have sufficient data to come to a decision on the point.
('50', 198, 2, 27, 318561) I trust Karsandas and, since he has asked for the sum, I think it is our duty to pay it.
('50', 198, 2, 28, 318650) In future, however, he may draw what he needs with Jamnalaljis or Kishorelals consent; that seems all right to me.
('50', 198, 2, 29, 318765) Copy out this part of the letter and send it to Karsandaswhen you remit the money to him.
('50', 198, 2, 30, 318855) He should give his opinion whether or not he agrees with me.
('50', 198, 2, 31, 318916) November 1, 1930
('50', 198, 3, 32, 318933) Along with this you will find letters to Prabhavati and Jayaprakash and one to Ghanshyamdas about them.
('50', 198, 3, 33, 319037) Put all the three in the same envelope and dispatch them immediately.
('50', 198, 3, 34, 319107) The couple is passing through extremely difficult circumstances just now owing to the death of Jayaprakashs mother.
('50', 198, 3, 35, 319223) Do the persons in the Ashram who spin weigh the quantity of waste yarn?

('50', 199, 0, 1, 319358) 200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 199, 1, 2, 319400) weighing it every day.
('50', 199, 1, 3, 319423) If anyone has been doing this, let me know the quantity of yarn he or she wastes.
('50', 199, 1, 4, 319505) What is the highest average speed per hour attained by anyone in spinning?
('50', 199, 1, 5, 319580) A person may, after careful preparation, attain excellent speed on one occasion; but that does not give the same value as the average speed maintained by someone who has kept a record for a year.
('50', 199, 1, 6, 319776) In calculating this, the time spent in replacing a broken belt or in cleaning a belt should also be taken into account.
('50', 199, 1, 7, 319896) Dont you agree that the figures given by a person would be correct only if he has included in them the time spent thus?
('50', 199, 2, 8, 320016) Tuesday morning, November 4, 1930
('50', 199, 3, 9, 320050) We have discussed the Ashram observances, their necessity and the meaning of yajna.
('50', 199, 3, 10, 320134) I propose now to discuss the meaning of the book, as I have understood it, on which we meditate daily and from which we recite some portion every day so as to complete all the chapters in a week, the book which we have accepted as our spiritual lighthouse.
('50', 199, 3, 11, 320391) A letter which I had once received had suggested this to me, but Govindjis letter received last week made me decide to take up the subject.
('50', 199, 3, 12, 320531) He says that he tries to read the Anasaktiyoga but finds it very difficult to understand.
('50', 199, 3, 13, 320621) Though I have tried to explain the meaning of the verses in a language which everyone can understand, a literal rendering is bound to present difficulties to the reader.
('50', 199, 3, 14, 320791) If the subject itself is difficult, how much can simplicity of language help?
('50', 199, 3, 15, 320869) I, therefore, intend here to present the subject itself in a manner easy to follow.
('50', 199, 3, 16, 320953) A book which we want to consult in every activity of our life and with whose help we try to solve all our spiritual problemsif we try again and again to understand the meaning of this book from all possible points of view and meditate over it constantly, we shall ultimately come to be filled with its spirit.
('50', 199, 3, 17, 321263) In all my spiritual difficulties I run to mother Gita and to this day she has never failed to comfort me.
('50', 199, 3, 18, 321369) It is, therefore, not impossible that otherswho seek similar comfort from her may, if they know what new light I get from it every day, receive further help or see some altogether new meaning in the work.
('50', 199, 3, 19, 321574) I propose today to give the substance of Chapter XII which deals with bhakti.
('50', 199, 3, 20, 321652) Whenever there is a wedding in the Ashram, we ask the couple to learn by heart and ponder over this Chapter as one of
('50', 200, 0, 1, 321770) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 201
('50', 200, 1, 2, 321815) the five sacrifices they have to offer.
('50', 200, 1, 3, 321855) Knowledge and action in the absence of devotion are dry as dust and are likely to make us confirmed bondslaves.
('50', 200, 1, 4, 321967) Let us therefore commence this study of the Gita with a heart full of devotion.

('50', 200, 6, 11, 322386) I will take care of the Jivan spinning wheel and ultimately return it to you.
('50', 200, 6, 12, 322464) I will also let you know my experience of it after I have tried it.
('50', 200, 6, 13, 322532) Both of you should take care of your health.
('50', 200, 6, 14, 322577) Your minds, of course, are pure.
('50', 200, 6, 15, 322610) Kakasaheb is quite well.
('50', 200, 6, 16, 322635) He will be released on the 28th at the latest.

('50', 201, 2, 3, 323181) YERAVDA MANDIR, November 6, 1930
('50', 201, 3, 4, 323214) MIRA, Your letter.
('50', 201, 3, 5, 323233) I do not think there is anything special about the Gandiv I got.
('50', 201, 3, 6, 323298) It gave all the trouble, you had, to Kaka.
('50', 201, 3, 7, 323341) I found out the cause of the trouble, removed it and it has never once given trouble.
('50', 201, 3, 8, 323427) The second mal must be as thin as possible.
('50', 201, 3, 9, 323471) I am using what Narandas sent from the Ashram.
('50', 201, 3, 10, 323518) I think 6 threads.
('50', 201, 3, 11, 323537) For the moving wheel the mal knot should be from the outside.
('50', 201, 3, 12, 323599) Neither need be too tight.
('50', 201, 3, 13, 323626) The wheel must move without any jerk.
('50', 201, 3, 14, 323664) It may be that the metal rings are not rigidly fixed in the wheels or the axles are not straight or in a straight line.
('50', 201, 3, 15, 323784) To me its beauty lies in its smooth working and less liability to go out of order.
('50', 201, 3, 16, 323867) But as I have said in my last letter, you need not divert your attention for the sake of the wheel.
('50', 201, 3, 17, 323967) I suppose it is true about wheels as it is true about most things that what suits one does not therefore suit all others.
('50', 201, 3, 18, 324089) Experts have to adjust values of different types.
('50', 201, 3, 19, 324139) We workers must be satisfied with that which will give the maximum of work with the minimum of trouble.
('50', 201, 3, 20, 324243) If I had the requisite mechanical training or was a genius in the art, I should love to become an expert in carding and spinning and judging bows, wheels and taklis.
('50', 201, 3, 21, 324409) But I must treat it as a forbidden ambition, though I do not leave off the search.
('50', 201, 3, 22, 324492) The search for me here is duty Lo/keZ Long or short, I hope to do at least one bhajan daily.
('50', 201, 3, 23, 324585) The Marathi I finished with Kakas assistance.
('50', 201, 3, 24, 324631) The Bengali too I began but on learning from K. that they were all translated by the Poet himself or under his supervision, I left off, thinking it a profanation even to attempt.
('50', 201, 3, 25, 324810) I have now, therefore, only 42 bhajans to do.
('50', 201, 3, 26, 324856) Marathi being very short, I was able to do sometimes even three per night.
('50', 201, 3, 27, 324931) I hope to finish before 42 days are out .
('50', 201, 3, 28, 324973) One question in your letter just now stares me about the Gandiv.
('50', 201, 3, 29, 325038) I mount the wheel end on a beam of wood nearly 3 inches high and I fix it on to the beam with 2 movable pins.
('50', 201, 3, 30, 325148) It thus lies slanting from top downward.
('50', 201, 3, 31, 325189) It can be even mounted on a box to lie flat.
('50', 201, 3, 32, 325234) K. tied it to the cane bottom of a chair and worked seated in a chair.
('50', 201, 3, 33, 325305) I am glad you saw Alexander.
('50', 201, 3, 34, 325334) He wrote to me directly.
('50', 201, 3, 35, 325359) The letter was given
('50', 202, 0, 1, 325380) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 203
('50', 202, 1, 2, 325425) to me about 10 days after its receipt.
('50', 202, 1, 3, 325464) I knew from him that he was able quite by accident to see you.
('50', 202, 1, 4, 325527) When you write to him please give him my love and tell him I had his letter.
('50', 202, 1, 5, 325604) I must not attempt to write separately to him.
('50', 202, 1, 6, 325651) Sufficient unto the day is the good thereof.

('50', 202, 6, 10, 325818) MIRA, Your letter.
('50', 202, 6, 11, 325837) I am glad you are feeling yourself again.
('50', 202, 6, 12, 325879) Please do not feel bound to try the Gandiv wheel.
('50', 202, 6, 13, 325929) I know you have many things to attend to and with a regularly going wheel, you might be able to finish your sacrificial spinning without any bother.
('50', 202, 6, 14, 326078) Give Andrews my love.
('50', 202, 6, 15, 326100) I can write a formal letter to him.
('50', 202, 6, 16, 326136) But I do not want to write a mere formal letter to him.
('50', 202, 6, 17, 326192) I would far rather let my silence speak to him.
('50', 202, 6, 18, 326240) The pen is often a superfluity, if not a hindrance, to hearts flow.
('50', 202, 6, 19, 326308) Mahadeo must not overstrain himself.
('50', 202, 6, 20, 326345) I have written to him strongly about him, but you should pull him up whenever he is reckless about his health.
('50', 202, 6, 21, 326456) My cold had disappeared altogether and, therefore, I did not even think of it when I wrote to you last week.
('50', 202, 6, 22, 326565) Yes, just now it is a combination of dates and vegetables, the latter sparingly.
('50', 202, 6, 23, 326646) But for the cold, I was getting on all right with the vegetables.
('50', 202, 6, 24, 326712) I may not give you more time this week.
('50', 202, 7, 25, 326752) BAPU [PS.] I hope to finish the hymns earlier than I had expected.

('50', 203, 3, 7, 327051) If Gangabehn were not with you, I would have certainly felt worried because of your having gone out of the Ashram.
('50', 203, 3, 8, 327166) But since she is with you, I feel easy in my mind.
('50', 203, 3, 9, 327217) Write to me regularly.

('50', 203, 8, 15, 327423) SUSHILA, I have your letter.
('50', 203, 8, 16, 327452) Though Manilal has lost 40 Ib., he seems to have preserved his strength, for he has asked my advice about what to read.
('50', 203, 8, 17, 327572) Pragjis request regarding the Phoenix Ashram seems reasonable to me.
('50', 203, 8, 18, 327641) However, it is for Manilal and you to decide about the matter.
('50', 203, 8, 19, 327704) Moreover, I do not have even enough facts to arrive at a decision.
('50', 203, 8, 20, 327771) Secondly, it is the common experience that, in such matters, only the person who held charge last can give the right decision.
('50', 203, 8, 21, 327898) Even if Bharatis handwriting is bad, she should write.
('50', 203, 8, 22, 327953) Why should one feel ashamed to write to a friend?
('50', 203, 8, 23, 328003) I must ask Krishnakant to forgive me.
('50', 203, 8, 24, 328041) I dont even remember his face.
('50', 203, 8, 25, 328072) I have of course heard his name from you and read it in your letters.
('50', 203, 8, 26, 328142) Wont he forgive me if I send him heaps of blessings?
('50', 203, 8, 27, 328195) Ask him.
('50', 203, 8, 28, 328204) If he does not forgive me, plead on my behalf.
('50', 203, 8, 29, 328251) Can you say that Sita has now become as strong as she was in South Africa?
('50', 203, 8, 30, 328326) Do you give her fruit to eat?
('50', 203, 8, 31, 328356) Convey my blessings to Pragji and write to him and tell him that service lies in doing the dutywhich comes to us unsought.
('50', 203, 8, 32, 328479) Who are now with Gomati?
('50', 203, 8, 33, 328504) What food do they get?
('50', 203, 8, 34, 328527) Give me all the news you have about her.

('50', 204, 2, 3, 328709) YERAVDA MANDIR, November 7, 1930
('50', 204, 3, 4, 328742) BHAGWANJI, I have your letter.
('50', 204, 3, 5, 328773) You will realize truth more and more as you will stop observing what others do and concentrate on your work.
('50', 204, 3, 6, 328882) Nor should you plunge too much into thinking.
('50', 204, 3, 7, 328928) Of course one has to think up to a point.
('50', 204, 3, 8, 328970) After that one should depend only on faith.
('50', 204, 3, 9, 329014) The mind too like the body suffers from indigestion when overstuffed.
('50', 204, 3, 10, 329084) Like the body the mind too needs to be put at rest.
('50', 204, 3, 11, 329136) That is why there has been enjoined constant repetition of Ramanama and other mantras.
('50', 204, 3, 12, 329223) They instantly put the mind to rest.
('50', 204, 3, 13, 329260) Now the meaning: The higher and the lower [para and apara] means, so to say, the unmanifest and the manifest.
('50', 204, 3, 14, 329370) The Gita often discusses them.
('50', 204, 3, 15, 329401) Let us understand it briefly as the Lord (Ishwar) or Brahman or even Truth.
('50', 204, 3, 16, 329477) Self evident truth is the higher and the other realized by an individual is therefore finite: [i.e.,] lower.
('50', 204, 3, 17, 329586) A person who has a glimpse of (this aspect of) the Lord in His higher form is relieved from the good or bad fruit of his actions and all his problems and misgivings disappear.
('50', 204, 3, 18, 329762) The Gita II.
('50', 204, 3, 19, 329775) 59, viz., the yearning too departs when he beholds the Supreme also conveys the same sense.
('50', 204, 3, 20, 329867) A person who becomes engrossed in discharging whatever duty naturally comes to his lot, has as good as realized the para 1 and this ought to put an end to his problems.
('50', 204, 3, 21, 330036) He who cannot experience it has not [yet] identified himself with his duty.
('50', 204, 3, 22, 330112) I have here tried to put it across so that you may understand it fully, but do ask me if you cannot, in spite of this.

('50', 205, 3, 6, 330608) I dont wish at all to hurt you and your sister, and at any rate I would not do so from here.
('50', 205, 3, 7, 330701) I know the great love that you two have for the children.
('50', 205, 3, 8, 330759) Do not worry about Kanti.
('50', 205, 3, 9, 330785) He is a brave boy and God, the Lord of us all, protects everyone.
('50', 205, 3, 10, 330851) You may see him whenever you get an opportunity and you should afterwards write to me and give me news about him.

('50', 206, 3, 7, 331588) Does he take milk, fruit, etc.?
('50', 206, 3, 8, 331620) Does he get any food from outside or does he eat only what he gets in jail?
('50', 206, 3, 9, 331696) Is there space where he can walk a little?
('50', 206, 3, 10, 331739) Does he have the strength to do it?
('50', 206, 3, 11, 331775) Does he have any companion with him?

('50', 207, 3, 6, 332867) Do you feel nervous?

('50', 207, 8, 15, 333282) BHAI NANABHAI, I read your remarks below Taras letter.
('50', 207, 8, 16, 333337) What you have been doing is enough.
('50', 207, 8, 17, 333373) If a person three feet in height feels unhappy because he cannot reach with his hand as high as a man six foot tall can do, he condemns the Creator of the world.
('50', 207, 8, 18, 333535) He who does his duty with love and devotion for God and to the best of his ability, discharges his debt fully.
('50', 207, 8, 19, 333646) I believe that you do this.
('50', 207, 8, 20, 333674) Why, then, should you feel discontented or unhappy?
('50', 207, 8, 21, 333726) You should, of course, try and find out why your body is so weak.
('50', 207, 8, 22, 333792) But it seems that all of you brothers have weak constitutions from your birth.
('50', 207, 8, 23, 333871) You should discover the cause and if, in your own case, there is no remedy, you should remove it in respect of persons under your care.

('50', 208, 3, 6, 334346) Give me one days sample from your diary.
('50', 208, 3, 7, 334387) You can teach Sita a little Sanskrit even as she plays with you.

('50', 209, 3, 5, 335375) You have done all right in going with Gangabehn.
('50', 209, 3, 6, 335424) Work sincerely now and be brave.
('50', 209, 3, 7, 335457) For your age, the handwriting is bad and the language also is not quite correct.
('50', 209, 3, 8, 335538) Make an effort and improve both.
('50', 209, 3, 9, 335571) You can do that even while you stay there.
('50', 209, 3, 10, 335614) What you will require for the effort is not time but perseverance.
('50', 209, 3, 11, 335681) Progressing slowly, you can improve quite a lot.

('50', 210, 3, 5, 336464) If your eyes are weak, it is right that you should not read much.
('50', 210, 3, 6, 336530) How many chapters of the Gita have you learnt by heart?
('50', 210, 3, 7, 336586) If you learn the whole of the Gita by heart, you will have plenty of material for reflection when your mind is not occupied otherwise.
('50', 210, 3, 8, 336721) Then it will not be necessary for you to read anything else.
('50', 210, 3, 9, 336782) You should, of course, fully understand what you learn by heart.
('50', 210, 3, 10, 336847) Is the yarn which you spin sufficiently strong?

('50', 210, 8, 18, 337107) So far, everything seems to be going as it should.
('50', 210, 8, 19, 337158) We are being tested well in every respect.

('50', 211, 3, 5, 337540) Your handwriting too is good.
('50', 211, 3, 6, 337570) It is all right that you draw lines.
('50', 211, 3, 7, 337607) I do not remember having not replied to any of your letters.
('50', 211, 3, 8, 337668) It is good that with the advance of winter you are also gaining weight.
('50', 211, 3, 9, 337740) If you take enough exercise you will beat the cold instead of the cold beating you.
('50', 211, 3, 10, 337824) Do you write to Lakshmibehn from time to time?
('50', 211, 3, 11, 337871) It is good that you are learning bhajans by heart.
('50', 211, 3, 12, 337922) You have to preserve and enhance the prestige of Panditjis position.
('50', 211, 3, 13, 337991) That will happen only when you outshine him.

('50', 211, 7, 19, 338269) It would be nice if Prabhudas wrote about the science of weaving.
('50', 211, 7, 20, 338335) I cannot suggest anything right now about spinning, etc.
('50', 211, 7, 21, 338392) Discuss it with Kaka when he is released.
('50', 211, 7, 22, 338434) I have talked to him mainly about these subjects.
('50', 211, 7, 23, 338484) He has become quite familiar with the difficulties faced by the spinners.
('50', 211, 7, 24, 338558) Have you come across any spinning wheels that deserve to be given a prize at first sight ?
('50', 211, 7, 25, 338649) If so, we must appoint an examiner and finish that work.
('50', 211, 7, 26, 338706) Amubhai and Mathuradas are qualified for it.
('50', 211, 7, 27, 338751) You have to be connected with it of course.
('50', 211, 7, 28, 338795) I suggest that Purushottam and Kesu of Jeevan chakra should be taken as advisers.
('50', 211, 7, 29, 338877) If Annada Babu has studied the science of the spinning wheel, he too should be taken as an examiner.
('50', 211, 7, 30, 338978) I cannot think of other names at the moment.

('50', 212, 5, 10, 339439) Go and see Devakinandans spinning wheel.
('50', 212, 5, 11, 339480) The name Savyasachi 4 is of course too high sounding for your spinning wheel.
('50', 212, 5, 12, 339558) Bharat will not do either.
('50', 212, 5, 13, 339585) Since, however, you reminded 5 me of Maganlal, I have suggested his name for your spinning wheel.
('50', 212, 5, 14, 339683) It was he who transformed spinning work into a science.
('50', 212, 5, 15, 339739) That name, therefore, is not improper for your spinning wheel.
('50', 212, 5, 16, 339802) Magan means roominess and also pleasure.
('50', 212, 5, 17, 339843) It is your claim that your spinning wheel gives people pleasure .
('50', 212, 5, 18, 339909) And finally, Maganlal had the virtues of Bharat 6 and Bharat was his ideal.
('50', 212, 5, 19, 339985) Your purpose 7 also will therefore be served.
('50', 212, 5, 20, 340031) After this, you may adopt whatever name you like.
('50', 212, 5, 21, 340081) If Bhavanidutta is a fit person, you should take him in.
('50', 212, 5, 22, 340138) You should not say such a one with reference to any person.
('50', 212, 5, 23, 340198) If Bhavanidutta does come, you should provide him food and drink at least.

('50', 212, 7, 26, 340606) Here, it would mean a spinning wheel which could be turned with either hand.

('50', 213, 2, 3, 340882) YERAVDA MANDIR, November 9, 1930
('50', 213, 3, 4, 340915) BHAI BUDHABHAI, I received your letter.
('50', 213, 3, 5, 340955) Practice writing with ink.
('50', 213, 3, 6, 340982) Writing with a pencil is a form of violence to the reader.
('50', 213, 3, 7, 341041) Of course, when writing with a pencil cannot be avoided, one is helpless.
('50', 213, 3, 8, 341115) A fast is not a substitute for eating less.
('50', 213, 3, 9, 341159) A fast by itself sometimes involves eating too much.
('50', 213, 3, 10, 341212) The right way of ensuring that you eat less is that at every meal, you should ask them to serve you only once, and that too, only in a small quantity.
('50', 213, 3, 11, 341363) Never eat so much that your hunger may be fully satisfied.
('50', 213, 3, 12, 341422) Stop eating as soon as you feel that you have eaten so much as would permit you to eat the same quantity again.
('50', 213, 3, 13, 341534) As long as you have not accustomed yourself to eating sparingly, it would be desirable not to insist on eating only five articles of food at one meal.
('50', 213, 3, 14, 341685) Eating sparingly will by itself mean that you eat only a few articles of food at a time.
('50', 213, 3, 15, 341774) You may take salt in reasonable quantity.
('50', 213, 3, 16, 341816) If you settle down at one place, why should you not grow in the yard some vegetables which would take only a short time to grow?
('50', 213, 3, 17, 341945) For instance, you could grow fenugreek leaves.

('50', 216, 6, 20, 345090) They have submitted themselves to a fine test.

('50', 216, 11, 34, 345642) I see that your rate of spinning per hour is greater than mine.
('50', 216, 11, 35, 345706) Do you spin 306 rounds or yards?
('50', 216, 11, 36, 345739) I hope you know that there is a difference between the two.
('50', 216, 11, 37, 345799) A round=4 ft., and a yard=3 ft.
('50', 216, 11, 38, 345831) On which type of wheel do you spin, and what is the

('50', 217, 1, 3, 345944) Nobody, including myself, knows when I shall be released.
('50', 217, 1, 4, 346002) Even the Government doesnt know.
('50', 217, 1, 5, 346035) But why should we think about the matter?
('50', 217, 1, 6, 346077) What difference does it make whether or not I am released?
('50', 217, 1, 7, 346136) You ask me to send you a picture.
('50', 217, 1, 8, 346170) But how can I get one in jail?
('50', 217, 1, 9, 346201) We cant get such things in a jail.
('50', 217, 1, 10, 346236) If, however, I come across any, I will preserve it for you.

('50', 217, 5, 14, 346421) November 10, 1930
('50', 217, 6, 15, 346439) Khuda Hafiz
('50', 217, 7, 16, 346451) DEAR DAUGHTER RAIHANA, I have your letter.
('50', 217, 7, 17, 346494) I was very glad.
('50', 217, 8, 18, 346511) Shouldnt you regard this much Urdu enough for the day?
('50', 217, 8, 19, 346566) If, even after your second lesson I do not write a few lines in Urdu, you might give me up as an unteachable pupil.
('50', 217, 8, 20, 346682) What should I do then?
('50', 217, 8, 21, 346705) If you dont have to spend too much time and take too much trouble in writing Urdu so neatly, continue to write to me in Urdu.
('50', 217, 8, 22, 346831) That would help me to keep up some Urdu without special effort.
('50', 217, 8, 23, 346895) You are all free to laugh as much as you wish at my bad handwriting and at spellingthat is still worse.
('50', 217, 8, 24, 346999) But please dont give me up as unteachable.
('50', 217, 8, 25, 347042) But I must say that there is no limit to your cunning.
('50', 217, 8, 26, 347097) I dont know where you learnt it.
('50', 217, 8, 27, 347130) I certainly do not remember to have taught that.
('50', 217, 8, 28, 347179) The poor girl!
('50', 217, 8, 29, 347194) As soon as I permit her to write in Urdu, she goes further and asks me to write in Urdu.
('50', 217, 8, 30, 347283) But, having adopted you, how can I get away from the fact?
('50', 217, 8, 31, 347342) Vandemataram to Mother.
('50', 217, 8, 32, 347366) Embrace Father on my behalf, and pull his beard hard.

('50', 218, 3, 6, 347778) Dont wait till your health has completely gone down before you start drinking it.
('50', 218, 3, 7, 347860) For some time, write to me regularly.
('50', 218, 3, 8, 347898) About Chalala, do what is possible after discussing the matter with Shankerlal.

('50', 218, 11, 23, 348462) [November 11, 1930] 1
('50', 218, 12, 24, 348484) NARANDAS, This time, too, I got your packet in two parts, first the English letters and then on the next day the others.
('50', 218, 12, 25, 348605) There was also a previous occasion when this happened.
('50', 218, 12, 26, 348660) They open the packet and look into the letters, hurriedly or carefully as they feel inclined before they hand them over to me.
('50', 218, 12, 27, 348787) They are of course required to read the letters.
('50', 218, 13, 28, 348836) 1 The letter was evidently begun earlier and completed on this date.
('50', 219, 0, 1, 348905) 220 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 219, 1, 2, 348947) letters are given to me in two parts so that I may get some of them at any rate as early as possible.
('50', 219, 1, 3, 349049) I had again a long letter from Keshu.
('50', 219, 1, 4, 349087) I find much substance in what he says.
('50', 219, 1, 5, 349126) He has gone deep into the matter.
('50', 219, 1, 6, 349160) I have formed the impression that .
('50', 219, 1, 7, 349196) 1 is hiding something.
('50', 219, 1, 8, 349219) Read my letter to Keshu and to .
('50', 219, 1, 9, 349252) 2 before you pass them on.
('50', 219, 1, 10, 349279) I have asked him what he thinks about Keshu.
('50', 219, 1, 11, 349324) I think his unpunctuality and other shortcomings are such as we can tolerate.
('50', 219, 1, 12, 349402) Being sincere, he does not want to make a false show.
('50', 219, 1, 13, 349456) He refuses to do anything which is beyond his capacity or which does not appeal to him.
('50', 219, 1, 14, 349544) But he has certainly the spirit of service in him.
('50', 219, 1, 15, 349595) Since he is pure at heart, I think it is our duty to bear his minor faults.
('50', 219, 1, 16, 349671) But Mahadev is there now and he says that he will abide by Mahadevs decision.
('50', 219, 1, 17, 349749) If Mahadev cannot settle the matter, in the last resort I will do so.
('50', 219, 1, 18, 349819) What you say about Hari ichchha is correct.
('50', 219, 1, 19, 349863) If you cannot stop the marriage from taking place in the Ashram, put up with the event.
('50', 219, 1, 20, 349951) I had indeed guessed about it and that is why I put that question to Harilal in my letter to him.
('50', 219, 1, 21, 350049) Did you read the further details about speed in spinning on the takli which Balkrishna gave in his letter this time?
('50', 219, 1, 22, 350166) It is increasing there.
('50', 219, 1, 23, 350190) I count the attainment of this speed a very important achievement.
('50', 219, 1, 24, 350257) I remember that four years ago a speed of hundred rounds per hour was considered excellent.
('50', 219, 1, 25, 350349) Now 160 rounds is the standard for passing, according to Vinoba.
('50', 219, 1, 26, 350414) Gangabehn has under taken a big task.
('50', 219, 1, 27, 350452) But God has always blessed her undertakings with success.
('50', 219, 1, 28, 350510) Dont mind if Kusum has gone.
('50', 219, 1, 29, 350539) Who will now help you personally?
('50', 219, 1, 30, 350573) I am sure you will feel hard pressed for want of enough workers to help you.
('50', 219, 1, 31, 350650) Owing to so many hands having left, the burden of work is likely to increase rather than diminish.
('50', 219, 1, 32, 350749) Who will take Kantas place?
('50', 219, 1, 33, 350777) Send me a final list of all the women who leave.
('50', 219, 1, 34, 350826) I approve of your diet.
('50', 219, 1, 35, 350850) If it suits you, it is almost an ideal combination.
('50', 219, 1, 36, 350902) Do not increase the quantity of ground nuts and do not eat ground nuts and copra on the same day.
('50', 219, 1, 37, 351000) The quantity of milk must not decrease now.
('50', 219, 1, 38, 351044) Half a pound is the minimum you should take.
('50', 219, 1, 39, 351089) It is Dr. Muthus view that that quantity supplies the necessary vitamins.
('50', 219, 1, 40, 351163) If you feel weak, increase the quantity of milk or curds.
('50', 219, 2, 41, 351221) 1 The names have been omitted.

('50', 220, 1, 2, 351297) Read my letter to Bhansali.
('50', 220, 1, 3, 351325) If he still wishes to be admitted, do what you think best.
('50', 220, 1, 4, 351384) If you are firm with him, you will have fewer difficulties with him.
('50', 220, 1, 5, 351453) Also read my letters to Lilabehn.
('50', 220, 2, 6, 351487) I dont see any substance in Mathews suspicion.
('50', 220, 2, 7, 351534) Read my reply to him.
('50', 220, 2, 8, 351556) Parnerkar should take rest.
('50', 220, 2, 9, 351584) Perhaps change of air may also be necessary.
('50', 220, 2, 10, 351629) He ought to improve his health.
('50', 220, 2, 11, 351661) I must get now a strong piece of leather for the soles or a new pair of utility shoes.
('50', 220, 2, 12, 351748) There are people who deserve shoes, but, when they get them, they do not accept them very cheerfully.
('50', 220, 2, 13, 351850) I, on the other hand, became fit for shoes long ago and am now impatient to get them!
('50', 220, 3, 14, 351936) Send with anyone who may come on a visit here Krishnadass books in Kashis possession.
('50', 220, 3, 15, 352022) I am in no hurry about them.
('50', 220, 4, 16, 352051) Tuesday morning, November 11, 1930
('50', 220, 5, 17, 352086) Tell Devdas that I have still not received his letter.
('50', 220, 5, 18, 352141) Where and when was it posted?
('50', 220, 5, 19, 352171) What did he say in it?
('50', 220, 5, 20, 352194) Let him write again.
('50', 220, 5, 21, 352215) If he can give me the date of that letter, I can make further inquiries.
('50', 220, 5, 22, 352288) Does anyone go and visit Somabhai and others who are in jail?
('50', 220, 5, 23, 352350) I know that it is difficult to visit such a large number.
('50', 220, 5, 24, 352408) But you should select those who are likely to be visited by nobody else.
('50', 220, 5, 25, 352481) It would be good if you could make some arrangement for visiting such prisoners.
('50', 220, 5, 26, 352562) Prabhavati gets no Gujarati papers at all.
('50', 220, 5, 27, 352605) We regularly receive Mumbai Samachar and other papers, and out of these you should send one or two to her.
('50', 220, 5, 28, 352712) She wrote to me about this once or twice but I forgot to mention it in my letters.
('50', 220, 5, 29, 352795) I had a separate letter from .
('50', 220, 5, 30, 352826) 2 yesterday.
('50', 220, 5, 31, 352839) Before I could write to him the letter which I wished to do, I had this letter of repentance from him and so the reply which I have given to him is altogether different from what it would otherwise have been.
('50', 220, 5, 32, 353048) The impression I have formed from his letter is that he is still hiding much.
('50', 220, 5, 33, 353126) You will understand this if you read my

('50', 221, 5, 11, 353694) You need not feel worried.
('50', 221, 5, 12, 353721) The disease from which you suffer is quite common these days.
('50', 221, 5, 13, 353783) If you take nutmeg, take only a pinch of it daily.
('50', 221, 5, 14, 353834) But the real remedy is mental.
('50', 221, 5, 15, 353865) You should always keep your body and mind fully occupied.
('50', 221, 5, 16, 353923) Never remain in a place where you are alone.
('50', 221, 5, 17, 353968) You should eat simple food, and at fixed hours.
('50', 221, 5, 18, 354016) If you stand it, you should bathe in cold water.
('50', 221, 5, 19, 354065) You may live in the Ashram, if you feel happy there, or go to Wardha.
('50', 221, 5, 20, 354135) I think you will probably feel uncomfortable at Wardha.
('50', 221, 5, 21, 354191) If you prefer to go to the Ashram, Narandas will call you up there.
('50', 221, 5, 22, 354259) Dont worry at all.
('50', 221, 5, 23, 354278) I will certainly write to you frequently.
('50', 221, 5, 24, 354320) You should write freely to me.

('50', 222, 3, 4, 354663) BHAISHRI KHAMBHATTA, I have your letter.
('50', 222, 3, 5, 354704) I have tried the Jivan spinning wheel.
('50', 222, 3, 6, 354743) It works quite well but at present I am experimenting on the Gandiv wheel.
('50', 222, 3, 7, 354818) The Jivan wheel is used by Kakasaheb.
('50', 222, 3, 8, 354856) He finds it quite convenient to spin on it, whereas he did not on the Gandiv wheel.
('50', 222, 3, 9, 354940) Personally, I have fallen in love with the latter for its simplicity and low cost.
('50', 222, 3, 10, 355023) However, I can give no final opinion yet.
('50', 222, 3, 11, 355065) Why cannot you experiment with a milk diet in Bombay?
('50', 222, 3, 12, 355119) There is no risk at all in doing so.
('50', 222, 3, 13, 355156) Probably curds will agree better than milk.
('50', 222, 3, 14, 355200) If the palate is no problem with you, I would advise you to try the experiment of a milk diet immediately.
('50', 222, 3, 15, 355307) It will certainly do you no harm; it provides sufficient nourishment.

('50', 223, 3, 4, 356119) MY DEAR CHARLIE, Though I wrote to Mira only the other day sending you my love and telling her I must not write to you as I could not write all I wanted to, I cannot restrain myself from writing to tell you how delighted I have felt to get a letter from you directly.
('50', 223, 3, 5, 356387) I think of you every day and that often.
('50', 223, 3, 6, 356428) You will give a good account of yourself wherever you are and you do so because you will always be where you are led.

('50', 223, 3, 9, 356644) I was sorry to hear that Gurudev had not kept well in America and that he was returning.
('50', 223, 3, 10, 356733) The marvel is that he can stand the strain at all at his age.
('50', 223, 3, 11, 356795) Please give my love to him and the Greggs.
('50', 223, 4, 12, 356838) MOHAN [PS.] Kaka is with me given as companion.
('50', 223, 4, 13, 356886) He sends you his love.
('50', 223, 4, 14, 356909) Both of us have kept well.

('50', 223, 8, 19, 357111) YERAVDA MANDIR, November 13, 1930
('50', 223, 9, 20, 357145) MIRA, Your letter.
('50', 223, 9, 21, 357164) The arrangement about translating my remarks on the Gita chapters is quite good.
('50', 223, 9, 22, 357245) I shall look forward to the joint handiwork.
('50', 223, 9, 23, 357290) I want to pour myself out into those chapters.
('50', 224, 0, 1, 357337) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 225
('50', 224, 1, 2, 357382) means additional work for you and will take up a great deal of your time.
('50', 224, 1, 3, 357456) However, I know you wont feel the strain of it, as you love that work.
('50', 224, 1, 4, 357527) Here is a letter from Andrews, this time, for me to send you.
('50', 224, 1, 5, 357589) He could not restrain himself from writing to me directly.
('50', 224, 1, 6, 357648) I have at last given him a few lines.
('50', 224, 1, 7, 357686) Dont give any time to the Gandiv till Keshu has obtained mastery over it and gives you a machine in working order.
('50', 224, 1, 8, 357801) For me it continues to provide further delights.
('50', 224, 1, 9, 357850) The original mal for the motor wheel at last had to be discarded, as I could not cut it any further for tightening it.
('50', 224, 1, 10, 357969) It has to be fairly stout and thick.
('50', 224, 1, 11, 358006) I had nothing with me in the hand spun mals of the required thickness.
('50', 224, 1, 12, 358077) As you know, I criminally neglected to learn how to make these little odds and ends.
('50', 224, 1, 13, 358162) And I was bent on having only the hand spun stuff.
('50', 224, 1, 14, 358213) I had to give full two hours to the first attempt.
('50', 224, 1, 15, 358264) It was successful and was possible only because only a short length was required.
('50', 224, 1, 16, 358346) My second attempt took me barely half an hour.
('50', 224, 1, 17, 358393) I had to make another for emergency, which occurred at once, for the original threads from which I made the mal were weak.
('50', 224, 1, 18, 358516) I have now thought of a device of quickly twisting to the required strength practically any number of threads.
('50', 224, 1, 19, 358627) My third attempt will therefore mean still less time.
('50', 224, 1, 20, 358681) And meantime I am having now an accumulation of little bits of stout hand spun chords which I can use for watchguards and the like.
('50', 224, 1, 21, 358813) All this gives me delight and comfort, for it means greater mastery over the wheel.
('50', 224, 1, 22, 358897) And this has become so easily possible because of the incredible simplicity of the Gandiv.
('50', 224, 1, 23, 358988) But I am not going to regard my opinion as final or authoritative till I have corroboration from someone who knows much more than I do of the mechanism of the charkha.
('50', 224, 1, 24, 359156) But I warn you against regarding this detailed description as any incentive for you to tackle the Gandiv.
('50', 224, 1, 25, 359262) I know if I was outside, I could not have given all this time, thought and attention to the thing.
('50', 224, 1, 26, 359361) It might not have even been desirable if it was to exclude other urgent matters.
('50', 224, 1, 27, 359442) I have given you the details merely to share my joy with you.
('50', 224, 1, 28, 359504) The charkha, the takli and the bow have become a fascination with me.
('50', 224, 1, 29, 359574) I do not seem to get tired of them.
('50', 224, 1, 30, 359610) Daily I wish I had more time to give to these things.
('50', 224, 1, 31, 359664) I want to secure greater output on all the three.
('50', 224, 1, 32, 359714) But I am so clumsy and so stupid and slow.
('50', 224, 1, 33, 359757) Somehow or other I feel that it is not the rigidity of old age that prevents from gaining a greater output.
('50', 224, 1, 34, 359865) I have not the proper knack I fear.
('50', 224, 1, 35, 359901) However I find satisfaction from the knowledge that God will accept this little offering
('50', 225, 0, 1, 359990) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 225, 1, 2, 360032) as the best possible for me in the circumstances.
('50', 225, 1, 3, 360082) If you can stand the cold bath in winter, nothing can be more bracing.
('50', 225, 1, 4, 360153) You will not strive against nature.
('50', 225, 1, 5, 360189) If there is no instantaneous warm reaction, you must revert to the warm bath.
('50', 225, 1, 6, 360267) The condition of reaction is vigorous rubbing with the bare hands.
('50', 225, 1, 7, 360334) I had sorrowfully to give up cold baths only after that wretched attack of pleurisy in London in 1914. Your food is quite good.
('50', 225, 1, 8, 360462) It may be necessary to take more ghee.
('50', 225, 1, 9, 360501) Experience has shown that you need a fair measure to keep strength, heat and weight.
('50', 225, 1, 10, 360586) Gangadevi may walk a little.
('50', 225, 1, 11, 360615) She must take measured steps and begin with a few minutes only at a time.
('50', 225, 1, 12, 360689) All risk of a setback should be avoided.
('50', 225, 1, 13, 360730) She will get rid of the urinary trouble by taking a hip bath.
('50', 225, 1, 14, 360792) If the water is chilly a little hot water may be added to take the chill off.
('50', 225, 1, 15, 360870) This hip bath is almost an infallible remedy.
('50', 225, 1, 16, 360916) Is not this uncle, who has married, somewhat elderly and who vies with you in indifferent spellings, though very learned?
('50', 225, 1, 17, 361038) So according to your birthdate, you are only a babe a few months old!!
('50', 225, 1, 18, 361109) You have therefore many a summer to look forward to.

('50', 225, 6, 22, 361291) SHARDA, Your letter.
('50', 225, 6, 23, 361312) Continue to have sun bath and oil massage.
('50', 225, 6, 24, 361355) While spinning on the takli, the thread should never snap.
('50', 225, 6, 25, 361414) I could not under stand your saying that there is little waste on the spinning wheel.
('50', 225, 6, 26, 361500) If you tell me the amount of waste in a given number of rounds of a particular count I would understand it.
('50', 225, 6, 27, 361608) Calculate it this way.
('50', 225, 6, 28, 361631) There is another way also.
('50', 225, 6, 29, 361658) Find out how often you pulled out the yarn and how often it snapped in the course of half an hour.
('50', 225, 6, 30, 361757) Is it clear to you that there is a difference between calculating the waste and [the frequency of snapping]?
('50', 225, 6, 31, 361866) If you have understood this, write to me what this difference is.

('50', 226, 3, 4, 362121) VASUMATI, I have your insipid letter.
('50', 226, 3, 5, 362159) How is it that, though participating in such a great revolution, you could not think of anything to write about?
('50', 226, 3, 6, 362272) It is possible, of course, that the mind may be stunned by the great changes taking place and reason may stop working; if so, one cannot think of anything to write about.
('50', 226, 3, 7, 362443) At such a time, ones mind may be wholly absorbed in work and can think about nothing else.
('50', 226, 3, 8, 362534) If you are in such a sublime state of mind, I have nothing to say.
('50', 226, 3, 9, 362601) I would then be satisfied even with a letter to this effect: Bapu, everything is going well.

('50', 226, 7, 13, 362763) 331. FRAGMENT OF LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI 1
('50', 226, 8, 14, 362806) November 13, 1930
('50', 226, 9, 15, 362824) I also see an error of principle in what you say regarding spinning and French.
('50', 226, 9, 16, 362904) Having dedicated yourself completely to spinning, you cannot do anything else for your personal benefit while spinning.
('50', 226, 9, 17, 363024) If somebody comes for a chat with you, you may talk with him for the sake of good manners.
('50', 226, 9, 18, 363115) But you cannot argue that, instead of his taking up your time in talking, he may as well teach you French.
('50', 226, 9, 19, 363222) You may, if you so wish, escape from the necessity of having to talk to him, and he also will not go on talking just in order that he may stay longer.
('50', 226, 9, 20, 363373) But once he has agreed to be your teacher, he is bound to sit with you sufficiently long.
('50', 226, 9, 21, 363463) All this has reference to the time when we are spinning for yajna.
('50', 226, 9, 22, 363530) I have been realizing the force of this argument in my own experience.
('50', 226, 9, 23, 363601) If, while I am spinning, I start thinking about other things, the speed of spinning and the count and
('50', 226, 10, 24, 363703) 1 The source does not mention the addressee.
('50', 226, 10, 25, 363748) But in Letter to Narandas Gandhi, 13/17 11 1930 where Gandhiji discusses spinning as yajna he asks Naran das to understand what he has said on the subject in his letter to Mahadev Desai.
('50', 226, 10, 26, 363935) Presumably this is the letter.
('50', 227, 0, 1, 363966) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 227, 1, 2, 364008) evenness of spinning are adversely affected.
('50', 227, 1, 3, 364053) Imagine Romain Rolland or Beethoven playing on the piano.
('50', 227, 1, 4, 364111) They would be so absorbed in the music that they would neither be able to talk with anyone nor think about anything else.
('50', 227, 1, 5, 364233) An artist is not apart from his art.
('50', 227, 1, 6, 364270) If this is true in regard to the music of the piano, how much more so must it be regarding the spinning yajna?
('50', 227, 1, 7, 364381) It may be true that, as we are today, we cannot act in this spirit but that is another matter.
('50', 227, 1, 8, 364476) If we keep our ideal pure, we are bound to succeed one day in putting it into practice.
('50', 227, 1, 9, 364564) Let me repeat that I am not criticizing what has happened.
('50', 227, 1, 10, 364623) Pitifully imperfect myself, what right have I to criticize anybody?
('50', 227, 1, 11, 364691) Do I put into practice all that I know to be true?
('50', 227, 1, 12, 364742) If I had done that, the seven lakh villages would have been filled with the sweet music of the spinning wheel long before now.
('50', 227, 1, 13, 364869) If even now I could live perfectly in conformity with what I know to be right, the cult of the spinning wheel would spread fast all over the country though I am here in jail.
('50', 227, 1, 14, 365044) Though the aspiration is beyond my strength at present, the mind is set firmly on it.
('50', 227, 1, 15, 365130) If God so decrees, I shall become the essence of light. (Plagiarizedfrom Raychandbhai, with apologies to him) I shall tire of praising the 33music of the spinning wheel when Malaviyaji does of praising the Bhagavata Purana.
('50', 227, 1, 16, 365354) We cannot, of course, speak of a spinning wheel Purana.
('50', 227, 1, 17, 365410) It will be for those who come after us to compose a Purana and they will do so if we have achieved anything which can be a worthy theme.
('50', 227, 1, 18, 365547) Just now, we are composing a few tunes of the spinning wheel music.
('50', 227, 1, 19, 365615) How great the music will be which ultimately results from them, will depend on our tapascharya and the measure of our self dedication.
('50', 227, 2, 20, 365750) I shall now dwell further on the argument of the previous letter.
('50', 227, 2, 21, 365816) I think the ideal is that we should observe complete silence when engaged in the spinning yajna, and think exclusively about spinning, that is, khadi or go on repeating Ramanama.
('50', 227, 2, 22, 365995) We should, of course, understand Ramanama in a wide sense.
('50', 227, 2, 23, 366054) Really speaking, we should go on repeating Ramanama silently to ourselves all the time, whether or not we consciously utter it with our lips.
('50', 227, 2, 24, 366196) It should be the unvarying accompaniment to all our thoughts and activities, like the tune on the tamboora in a musical recital.
('50', 227, 2, 25, 366325) When, however, our attention is not
('50', 227, 3, 26, 366361) 1 Omission as in the source.
('50', 227, 3, 27, 366390) What follows seems to have been taken from a subsequent letter.
('50', 228, 0, 1, 366454) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 6 JANUARY, 1931 229
('50', 228, 1, 2, 366499) wholly absorbed in the work which we are doing, we should consciously go on repeating Ramanama.
('50', 228, 1, 3, 366595) While spinning, we generally talk with somebody or listen to what people tell us or do some other work.
('50', 228, 1, 4, 366699) This kind of spinning is certainly not yajna.
('50', 228, 1, 5, 366745) If the yajna of spinning is a sacred obligation, the time which we give to it should be wholly dedicated to it.
('50', 228, 1, 6, 366857) He who lives his life in the spirit of yajna and works without attachment will always be engaged in one task at a time.
('50', 228, 1, 7, 366977) Though I know this well enough, I was the first to sin (be it more or less) in this respect, for it can be said that I never sat down in a secluded spot to spin quietly, that is, in complete silence.
('50', 228, 1, 8, 367177) On my silence days, while spinning I either used to hear the mail being read out to me or listened to what people wanted to tell me.
('50', 228, 1, 9, 367310) Even here I have not given up that bad habit.
('50', 228, 1, 10, 367356) Is it any wonder, then, that though I spin regularly I have made no progress at all in the field and have barely acquired the speed of 200 rounds an hour?
('50', 228, 1, 11, 367511) I see in myself many other deficiencies, besides this; for instance, while I am spinning the thread snaps, I do not know how to make a belt, know very little about spindle holders, cannot tell the quality of cotton, cannot as certain with precision the evenness of the thread and cannot judge the quality of the fibre.
('50', 228, 1, 12, 367830) Does this befit one who claims to do spinning as yajna?
('50', 228, 1, 13, 367886) Is it then surprising that the progress of khadi should be slow?
('50', 228, 1, 14, 367951) If God is in truth God of the poor, and certainly He is that, and if khadi is the symbol of His grace, then I am the oracle, or what you will, who proclaimed this truth, and yet how slack have I been in putting into practice my own teaching!
('50', 228, 1, 15, 368193) I, therefore, never feel tempted to criticize anybody else in this matter.
('50', 228, 1, 16, 368268) I am only trying to describe to you my own deficiency in this regard and my pain, and the self understanding and knowledge which result from that pain.
('50', 228, 1, 17, 368420) Though I have occasionally expressed such sentiments while talking with Kaka, you are the first person to whom I have expressed them so clearly, and I got the opportunity to do this because you combined the study of French with spinning.
('50', 228, 1, 18, 368658) Let me repeat that I see no fault on your part in having done that.
('50', 228, 1, 19, 368726) On the contrary, I see what an imperfect preacher of the mantra of spinning I have been.
('50', 228, 1, 20, 368815) I knew the mantra but did not observe its ritual perfectly, and, therefore, it failed to reveal its full power.
('50', 228, 1, 21, 368927) Apply to all activities in life the argument which I have applied here to spinning.
('50', 228, 1, 22, 369011) You will then be able to feel in
('50', 229, 0, 1, 369044) 230 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('50', 229, 1, 3, 369184) This is the meaning of the verse, Yoga is skill in work.
('50', 229, 1, 4, 369241) 1 If we cultivate this attitude, we shall attempt only what is within our capacity to do and shall rest content with it.
('50', 229, 1, 5, 369362) I am convinced that by working in this spirit we shall have contributed most to our own development and that of society.
('50', 229, 1, 6, 369483) But all this will be mere philosophizing if I myself do not follow it in practice in everything I do.
('50', 229, 1, 7, 369585) I am certainly making progress day by day in my effort to do so.
('50', 229, 1, 8, 369650) What will happen when I am released, God alone knows.
('50', 229, 1, 9, 369704) If possible, observe this at least in practice.
('50', 229, 1, 10, 369752) Spin in this systematic manner the number of rounds which you regard as your daily contribution to the spinning yajna.
('50', 229, 1, 11, 369871) You may spin the rest in any manner that you can, for the purpose of increasing the countrys wealth.
('50', 229, 1, 12, 369972) I feel tempted to go on writing still further.

('50', 230, 3, 4, 370680) GANGADEVI, I have not written for a long time and you seem to have taken a vow of not writing to me unless I do.
('50', 230, 3, 5, 370793) I have written to Mirabehn fully regarding walking and the pain you have.
('50', 230, 3, 6, 370867) She will explain to you.
('50', 230, 3, 7, 370892) Do not hesitate to write to me anything you feel like.

('50', 230, 9, 13, 371083) BHURRR TO WHITE BEARDED YOUNG MAN, THREE WEEKS GUEST, If I write in Gujarati to the daughter, who, though a mere girl, tries to look old, why should I not write in the mother tongue to the father who, though old, is getting younger day by day?
('50', 230, 9, 14, 371327) In the West people communicate by means of wires, and transmit images too.

('50', 230, 9, 16, 371431) I see before me a youthful face, white bearded but bursting with hearty laughter, and I hear the man telling the reporter: I shall be back in the guest house within three weeks. I have in my pocket the likeness of his face notwithstanding that I dont have a pocket.
('50', 230, 9, 17, 371697) The old man has played his part marvellously well.

('50', 231, 3, 4, 371976) KUSUM (SENIOR), What shall I write to you?
('50', 231, 3, 5, 372019) Once you sat down to write to me, you could give me plenty of news.
('50', 231, 3, 6, 372087) Now adhere to the resolution you have made.
('50', 231, 3, 7, 372131) You can, if you wish, complain about your lot to me.
('50', 231, 3, 8, 372184) We must find our happiness in suffering.
('50', 231, 3, 9, 372225) One may say that that is the teaching of the Gita.
('50', 231, 3, 10, 372276) I dont however wish to give a sermon.
('50', 231, 3, 11, 372314) I had at last to ask them to send me a pair of sandals.
('50', 231, 3, 12, 372370) I require no clothes.
('50', 231, 3, 13, 372392) I use the rug supplied from here.
('50', 231, 3, 14, 372426) And I also have with me the one which I had taken with me when starting for the march.
('50', 231, 3, 15, 372513) I have received plenty of khadi.
('50', 231, 3, 16, 372546) I hope you are all right now.

('50', 231, 9, 24, 372808) Please do not hesitate to write to me whenever you wish.
('50', 231, 9, 25, 372865) It was good that you mentioned Dadabhai [Naoroji] in your letter.
('50', 231, 9, 26, 372931) He was like a father to me.
('50', 231, 9, 27, 372959) When I first reached England he was the only senior person to whom I had a letter [of introduction].
('50', 231, 9, 28, 373060) He took me under his care then and never left me afterwards.
('50', 231, 9, 29, 373121) It was he who led us during our early days in South Africa.
('50', 231, 9, 30, 373181) Every fortnight (almost) I used to have a letter from him.

('50', 232, 3, 5, 373517) Real progress appears to be slow but in fact it is the short cut to our destination.
('50', 232, 3, 6, 373602) As man engages more and more in the service that has fallen to his lot, without attachment to the results, he attains freedom from desire without effort.
('50', 232, 3, 7, 373756) Control over the sense organs, too, then becomes an absolutely easy thing.

('50', 232, 9, 13, 374016) Why do you write what looks like the marks left by a fly crawling across the sheet, and spoil your handwriting right from this age?
('50', 232, 9, 14, 374148) Can you not get ink there?
('50', 232, 9, 15, 374175) And you dont write anything about your health.
('50', 232, 9, 16, 374222) You are quite right when you say that our sacrifices are nothing as compared to the sacrifices made by the women on that side.
('50', 232, 9, 17, 374349) Well, then, learn to make similar sacrifices while you live there and devote yourself wholly to service.

('50', 233, 8, 13, 375115) November 14, 1930
('50', 233, 9, 14, 375133) GANGABEHN, Your letter to Kakasaheb was received late.
('50', 233, 9, 15, 375188) I understood the situation better from it.
('50', 233, 9, 16, 375231) People certainly give you credit.
('50', 233, 9, 17, 375265) But exercise the utmost patience.
('50', 233, 9, 18, 375299) You have taken upon yourself a great responsibility.
('50', 233, 9, 19, 375352) But you should meditate over those three verses which we have recently included in the prayers.
('50', 233, 9, 20, 375448) Those who work for God with His name ever on their lips, He makes them His special concern and ensures the success of their undertakings, and it is He who guides them; why, then, should we worry?
('50', 233, 9, 21, 375644) Padma seems to have got fever.
('50', 233, 9, 22, 375675) She has a swelling too.
('50', 233, 9, 23, 375699) If you cannot judge what to do to cure her, get her examined by Haribhai.
('50', 233, 9, 24, 375773) If you can judge what to do, dont be afraid to apply any treatment you think best.
('50', 233, 9, 25, 375856) Even when doing that, you should feel that you are guided by God and take measures which seem best at the moment; having done that, you should rest completely free from worry.
('50', 233, 9, 26, 376032) Do not take upon yourself a burden beyond your strength to carry.
('50', 233, 9, 27, 376098) Man has ill treated woman and is still doing so.
('50', 233, 9, 28, 376147) But the remedy for this ultimately lies in womans own hand.
('50', 233, 9, 29, 376207) If she stops thinking
('50', 234, 0, 1, 376229) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 6 JANUARY, 1931 235
('50', 234, 1, 2, 376274) that she is weak, she can be free this very day.
('50', 234, 1, 3, 376323) The really strong are not those who are strong in body.
('50', 234, 1, 4, 376379) Ravana, who was a demon, that is, had physical strength, was helpless before the seemingly weak Sita.
('50', 234, 1, 5, 376481) I am sure you remember the story.
('50', 234, 1, 6, 376515) Sita was under the protection of a boon to the effect that anyone who cast an evil glance at her would be instantly burnt to ashes.
('50', 234, 1, 7, 376647) Ravana knew this and that is why, though he carried her away, he could not touch her person with impure thoughts.
('50', 234, 1, 8, 376761) He had to entreat Sita to let him embrace her.
('50', 234, 1, 9, 376808) He threatened her time and again in the hope that she might yield; but unless she yielded of her own free will he was, in spite of his strength, as helpless as a goat.
('50', 234, 1, 10, 376976) Though physically Sita was utterly helpless, in spirit she was a lioness.
('50', 234, 1, 11, 377050) We know the meaning of a boon.
('50', 234, 1, 12, 377081) It is only a symbol.
('50', 234, 1, 13, 377102) Every woman who has inviolable purity of character enjoys the same boon as Sita did.
('50', 234, 1, 14, 377187) Any man who casts an evil glance at such a woman would be instantly burnt to ashes.
('50', 234, 1, 15, 377271) If man hasill treated woman, the reason is that she, too, has yielded to lust.
('50', 234, 1, 16, 377350) Being enslaved by passion, both forgot their higher nature, forgot that they were souls and remained mere bodies.
('50', 234, 1, 17, 377464) So far as the body is concerned, man is undoubtedly the stronger of the two.
('50', 234, 1, 18, 377541) Hence woman was enslaved by man and the impression came to prevail that she was helpless before man, that she was weak and always needed mans protection.
('50', 234, 1, 19, 377695) As souls man and woman are equal.
('50', 234, 1, 20, 377729) If a man does not recognize his spiritual nature but a woman does, the latter is the stronger of the two, as Sita was stronger than Ravana, and the other remains weaker, as was Ravana.
('50', 234, 1, 21, 377914) Dont believe, moreover, that this was possible only in the time of Rama.
('50', 234, 1, 22, 377987) Even today there are countless Sitas in the world who require no mans help and are yet safe against all danger.
('50', 234, 1, 23, 378099) One such is Janakimaiya.
('50', 234, 1, 24, 378124) You must have seen her.
('50', 234, 1, 25, 378148) Whenever I went to Bombay, she came and saw me.
('50', 234, 1, 26, 378196) She had not much intellectual capacity to speak of, but had boundless strength of spirit.
('50', 234, 1, 27, 378286) She must have been good looking in her youth.
('50', 234, 1, 28, 378332) She embraced a hard path of service in the prime of her youth.
('50', 234, 1, 29, 378395) I have known other Indian women like her, and also Englishwomen.
('50', 234, 1, 30, 378460) They are examples of but a small measure of spiritual strength.
('50', 234, 1, 31, 378524) A woman who has fully grown in soul deserves to be revered as the worlds mother.
('50', 234, 1, 32, 378605) For those who wish to cultivate such strength, satyayuga exists today.
('50', 234, 1, 33, 378676) Your task, therefore, is to make women strong.
('50', 234, 1, 34, 378723) That is the right method of securing justice from men.
('50', 234, 1, 35, 378778) A man like me may guide you

('50', 235, 1, 3, 378903) But my capacity for serving women is limited.
('50', 235, 1, 4, 378949) Women alone can serve women perfectly.
('50', 235, 1, 5, 378988) It is my ambition, through the Ashram, to prepare not one such worker but many.
('50', 235, 1, 6, 379068) An opportunity to do so has presented itself to us just now.

('50', 235, 13, 23, 379779) I see that you are really ill.
('50', 235, 13, 24, 379810) It will be enough if you can get fruits like oranges, sweet lemons, fresh grapes, etc.
('50', 235, 13, 25, 379897) It will also help you if you take dried black grapes or raisins soaked in water.

('50', 236, 5, 7, 380415) PREMA, I got your letter.
('50', 236, 5, 8, 380441) You certainly did well in consulting a doctor.
('50', 236, 5, 9, 380488) But I cling to the cure I have suggested.
('50', 236, 5, 10, 380530) You may, if you wish, carry out the doctors treatment afterwards.
('50', 236, 5, 11, 380596) Fast for at least seven days before you do anything else.
('50', 236, 5, 12, 380654) We should never be afraid of fasting.
('50', 236, 5, 13, 380692) During a seven day fast, you will be able to attend to almost all your work.
('50', 236, 5, 14, 380769) When I first undertook a long fast, I did not rest for a single day and experienced no difficulty on that account.
('50', 236, 5, 15, 380884) It was a seven day fast.
('50', 236, 5, 16, 380909) At that time, I did have some fat on my body.
('50', 236, 5, 17, 380955) Only a person who has no reserve of fat is forced to lie down during a fast.
('50', 236, 5, 18, 381032) After two days of fasting, you will actually feel stronger.
('50', 236, 5, 19, 381092) For two days, you may get a feeling of being hungry, but it will disappear after that and real hunger will return when the blood has been purified.
('50', 236, 5, 20, 381240) Till that time, you should take an enema every day and keep the bowels clean.
('50', 236, 5, 21, 381318) If, after taking the enema, you remain in the ardha sarvangasan posture, the water may even reach the large intestine.
('50', 236, 5, 22, 381437) You may omit this, however, if you do not know how to do it.
('50', 236, 5, 23, 381498) During the fast, you should drink plenty of water with soda bicarb and salt mixed in it.
('50', 236, 5, 24, 381587) You may mix five grains of salt and ten grains of soda in every eight ounces of water and may safely drink up to eight cups of such water.
('50', 236, 5, 25, 381726) You should also take sun bath.
('50', 236, 5, 26, 381757) I should like you to do this without any fear in your mind.
('50', 236, 5, 27, 381817) You may tell the doctor about it, if you wish.
('50', 236, 5, 28, 381864) Probably he, too, will approve of this cure.
('50', 236, 5, 29, 381909) Many doctors now know about the miraculous effects of fasts.

('50', 237, 9, 17, 382657) The letter addressed to Ba has also been sent to me.
('50', 237, 9, 18, 382710) I do not know what was decided in the end.
('50', 237, 9, 19, 382753) Ba writes that she had fallen ill and people told her that her presence was needed more in areas around Bardoli.
('50', 237, 9, 20, 382866) Yes, I have seen the prize given to Jawahar.
('50', 237, 9, 21, 382911) 1 He deserves even more.
('50', 237, 9, 22, 382936) But for the present this should satisfy us.
('50', 237, 9, 23, 382980) It will be a real test for the people when no leaders are out and only then will the women too get the real chance.
('50', 237, 9, 24, 383096) I find that Krishna 2 and now Shyam Kumari too have been released.
('50', 237, 9, 25, 383163) How sad!

('50', 239, 7, 12, 385071) MY DEAR KUMARAPPA, If a man makes an unalterable decision to do or not to do a particular thing, it is for me a vow.
('50', 239, 7, 13, 385188) The strongest men have been known at times to have become weak.
('50', 239, 7, 14, 385252) God has a way of confounding us in our strength.
('50', 239, 7, 15, 385301) Hence the necessity of vows, i.e., invoking Gods assistance to give us strength at the crucial moment.
('50', 239, 7, 16, 385404) But I must not strive with you.
('50', 239, 7, 17, 385436) It seems to me that we mean the same thing but express it differentlyyou in Spanish and I in Italian, shall we say?

('50', 239, 12, 25, 385793) Even that is a lot.
('50', 239, 12, 26, 385813) But he seems to be very cheerful, and has also been reading a great deal.
('50', 239, 12, 27, 385887) God has given him the strength to live in all circumstances.

('50', 240, 7, 11, 386403) It is true indeed that you make a great many plans in your mind.
('50', 240, 7, 12, 386468) But, then, you are not too old to carry out many of them at the proper time.
('50', 240, 7, 13, 386545) Just now, however, in devoting oneself whole heartedly to the work one has taken up lies the pursuit of painting or music or Sanskrit; it is marriage for those who want to marry and the vow of virginity for the unmarried.

('50', 241, 6, 14, 387826) But now it will not be even two weeks before he is released.
('50', 241, 6, 15, 387887) Your experiences have been useful.
('50', 241, 6, 16, 387922) You are right when you say that whether a person learns or not depends mostly on how hard he works.
('50', 241, 6, 17, 388022) All that a teacher can do is to point out his error when he goes wrong.

('50', 242, 9, 16, 389509) The wrong habits of many years will not change in a day.

('50', 244, 3, 6, 391244) on Wednesday, that is, yesterday.
('50', 244, 3, 7, 391278) The devotee renounces all undertakings.
('50', 244, 3, 8, 391318) 1 This means the devotee will not draw up schemes of future expansion.
('50', 244, 3, 9, 391389) For example, if a merchant who deals in cloth now has any plans of selling firewood as well in the future, or if he, having one shop only, thinks of opening five more shops, that would be arambha (undertaking) on his part, and the devotee will have none of it.
('50', 244, 3, 10, 391650) This principle is applicable to service of the nation as well.
('50', 244, 3, 11, 391713) For instance, a worker in the khadi department today will not take up cow keeping tomorrow, agriculture the day after and medical aid on the fourth day.
('50', 244, 3, 12, 391866) He will do his best in whatever has come to him.
('50', 244, 3, 13, 391915) When I am free from egoism, nothing remains for me to do.
('50', 244, 3, 14, 391973) The Lord has bound me with a cotton thread; I am His, no matter where He leads me.
('50', 244, 3, 15, 392056) I have been stabbed with the dagger of love. A devotees every activity is planned by God.
('50', 244, 3, 16, 392146) It comes to him as in the natural course of things.
('50', 244, 3, 17, 392198) He therefore rests content with,this, that or anything else (  |) This is the meaning of reonouncing all undertakings.
('50', 244, 3, 18, 392317) The devotee does not cease to work; indeed he is nothing if not a worker.
('50', 244, 3, 19, 392391) He only ceases to think needless thoughts about his work.
('50', 244, 3, 20, 392449) It is these that he hat to renounce.
('50', 244, 3, 21, 392486) This has been acquired by me today; that purpose I shall gain tomorrow 2 this is the opposite of renouncing undertakings.
('50', 244, 3, 22, 392608) I think this answers your question fully.
('50', 244, 3, 23, 392650) Ask me if anything is left out.
('50', 244, 3, 24, 392682) Keep this portion with the discussion which is proceeding.
('50', 244, 3, 25, 392741) If, along with the new pair of sandals, you have not sent a piece of leather for repairing the soles, and if you can get such a piece and send it, with someone who may be coming on a visit here, please do send it, or send it by sample post provided it does not cost much, so that I can use when necessary even the worn out sandals.

('50', 245, 1, 3, 393253) A time will come when he will not haw to plan undertakings in this fashion.
('50', 245, 1, 4, 393329) God will load him with tasks of service one after another.
('50', 245, 1, 5, 393388) He will not have to plan for them or seek them.
('50', 245, 1, 6, 393436) Just now, his planning for them is all right.
('50', 245, 1, 7, 393482) From this he will come to taste the joy of bhakti.
('50', 245, 1, 8, 393533) So long as there are no rains, we have no choice but to exert ourselves and draw water from wells, rivers, streams, etc.
('50', 245, 1, 9, 393654) But, when the clouds burst in the sky and we have the Ganga flowing at our doorstep, what else need we do then?
('50', 245, 1, 10, 393766) I think the work he could do in Nasik would have been beyond the capacity of anyone else.
('50', 245, 1, 11, 393856) All the same, it would be good if others, too, tried.
('50', 245, 1, 12, 393910) In my own case, I have to content myself with a sincere effort, and I apply to others the same yardstick as I do to me.
('50', 245, 1, 13, 394030) I can say or write much more about this, but all that can wait till we meet.
('50', 245, 1, 14, 394107) As for what the heart feels and wishes to convey, I have set it down above.
('50', 245, 1, 15, 394183) This for Jamnalal.
('50', 245, 1, 16, 394202) I have written to you about .
('50', 245, 1, 17, 394232) 1. It is but right that none of us is satisfied with his confession.
('50', 245, 1, 18, 394301) The evil in his heart is deep.
('50', 245, 1, 19, 394332) I have of course written strongly to him.
('50', 245, 1, 20, 394374) I suppose all of you must have expressed your dissatisfaction to him.
('50', 245, 1, 21, 394444) So long as we are not satisfied about his purity, we cannot ask him to do any public service.
('50', 245, 1, 22, 394538) He himself may do it on his own in the spirit of sacrifice.
('50', 245, 1, 23, 394598) You may act in this matter as you think best.We need not be angry with him.
('50', 245, 1, 24, 394674) We should act as love may prompt us to do.
('50', 245, 1, 25, 394717) It is only the person on the spot who can realize what love requires him to do in certain circumstances.
('50', 245, 1, 26, 394822) From a distance one can send no instructions about that.

('50', 245, 3, 28, 394903) Tell Manilal that the letter I received this time is the only one I have had from him.
('50', 245, 3, 29, 394990) I did not receive his earlier letters.
('50', 245, 3, 30, 395029) If he did write any, how did he send them, that is, with whom?
('50', 245, 3, 31, 395092) I will inquire if I get definite information.
('50', 245, 3, 32, 395138) If he is eager to have letters from me, I too wish to write to him.
('50', 245, 3, 33, 395206) But I have a general understanding with the officials that I would not write to prisoners, and I abide by it.
('50', 245, 3, 34, 395316) I enjoy sufficiently good freedom in other respects in the matter of writing letters and so I do not quarrel with them unnecessarily for further concessions.
('50', 245, 3, 35, 395474) When our attitude is that we should be content in jail even if they do not permit us to write any letter at all, we ought not to quarrel on such grounds.
('50', 245, 3, 36, 395628) Even so, we do send messages.
('50', 245, 3, 37, 395658) Manilal,

('50', 246, 1, 2, 395741) however, should write as often as he is permitted to do.
('50', 246, 1, 3, 395798) I have already written to you about his studies and he must have got the message.
('50', 246, 1, 4, 395880) His present programme of reading is good enough.
('50', 246, 1, 5, 395929) But the plan which I have suggested seems to me methodical and complete.
('50', 246, 1, 6, 396002) If, therefore, he can take interest in those books, he should follow that plan.
('50', 246, 1, 7, 396082) Sushila wrote to me saying that he had lost 40 Ib.
('50', 246, 1, 8, 396133) in weight.
('50', 246, 1, 9, 396144) I suppose that was an error.
('50', 246, 1, 10, 396173) Or did he really lose as much as that at any time?
('50', 246, 1, 11, 396224) Has he now been recovering it or has the reduction come to stay?
('50', 246, 1, 12, 396289) How about his strength?
('50', 246, 1, 13, 396313) He is right in his view about Phoenix.
('50', 246, 1, 14, 396352) If the paper is running at a loss, they should close it.
('50', 246, 1, 15, 396409) Ask Manilal to write to that effect.
('50', 246, 1, 16, 396446) I, too, will write, when I am permitted to do so.
('50', 246, 1, 17, 396496) I had a letter from Pragji.
('50', 246, 1, 18, 396524) The Headman has just gone out and will decide what reply to give after he returns.
('50', 246, 1, 19, 396607) Meanwhile you can write to him and tell him that I think Pragji ought to get all the powers which he asks for.
('50', 246, 1, 20, 396718) I am awaiting your reply regarding the letter which Devdas wrote to me.
('50', 246, 1, 21, 396790) You will find something about spinning in the letter to Mirabehn.
('50', 246, 1, 22, 396856) I will write to her tomorrow.
('50', 246, 1, 23, 396886) You will find something more important still in the letter to Mahadev, 1 which I want all of you to understand.
('50', 246, 1, 24, 396998) To spin by way of yajna and to take up spinning as labour in order merely to add that much to ones earning are twodifferent things.
('50', 246, 1, 25, 397130) In yajna, the actual work, though extremely important, is of secondary value.
('50', 246, 1, 26, 397208) In spinning undertaken as labour, the actual work is all that matters.
('50', 246, 1, 27, 397279) Irrespective of whether it is anything more than that, even as work it bears fruit.
('50', 246, 1, 28, 397363) In doing anything as yajna one is not concerned with the fruit of ones labour and, therefore, the fruit is immeasurable.
('50', 246, 1, 29, 397484) That is, yajna completely fulfils ones cherished desires.
('50', 246, 1, 30, 397542) In performing such a yajna, one must lose oneself in ones work.
('50', 246, 1, 31, 397606) By doing that one learns the science and art of working.
('50', 246, 1, 32, 397663) Anyone, therefore, who would work in the spirit of yajna should have such qualities as purity of heart, etc., and should do his sacrificial work with single minded devotion.
('50', 246, 1, 33, 397837) He would not even think about anything else when working.
('50', 246, 1, 34, 397895) A worker inspired with such spirit of sacrifice should have mastered all that is known about the science of spinning and should be daily adding to the existing knowledge.
('50', 246, 1, 35, 398066) If a peson who has voluntarily embraced the path of sacrifice has made mistakes through negligence or want of means or for any other reason, he should have the strength to rectify them as and when he

('50', 247, 0, 1, 398320) 248 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 247, 1, 2, 398362) detects them.
('50', 247, 1, 3, 398376) I use the word spinning here in a symbolical sense.
('50', 247, 1, 4, 398428) It stands for proficiency in all the processes relating to cotton.
('50', 247, 1, 5, 398495) You will think this a big task, which it is and is not.
('50', 247, 1, 6, 398551) It is not a big or difficult task for those who have recognized its necessity, for they will be making some progress every day towards mastery of these processes and will grow in purity of heart day by day.
('50', 247, 1, 7, 398758) A person who works in the spirit of sacrifice will be a lover of truth and will, therefore, after he has realized the necessity of working in this spirit, go on voluntarily increasing his knowledge and proficiency without having to make a strenuous effort.
('50', 247, 1, 8, 399015) Even if he has to do so, he will look upon that as Gods grace and not a hardship.
('50', 247, 1, 9, 399097) I feel, therefore, that all of us should adopt the method which.
('50', 247, 1, 10, 399162) I have explained in a previous letter and understand this deeper and truer meaning of yajna.
('50', 247, 1, 11, 399255) I have explained sufficiently clearly in my letter to Mahadev how much I myself am to blame for our failure to understand this and put it into practice.
('50', 247, 2, 12, 399408) 5 oclock, November 16, 1930 I forgot to tell you in my last letter about Kakasahebs suggestion to reduce exactly by half the time for completing once the devotional reading of the Gita.
('50', 247, 2, 13, 399594) You must have read about it if you saw the letter to Vinoba.
('50', 247, 2, 14, 399655) I forgot to tell you that you should read that letter.
('50', 247, 2, 15, 399710) His suggestion is that we shall be conforming better to the tradition if we complete one reading in a week.
('50', 247, 2, 16, 399818) Anyone who wants tojoin in the middle of a week will not then have to think how far the reading must have progressed.
('50', 247, 2, 17, 399936) Every week you will be reciting the same verses on a particular day.
('50', 247, 2, 18, 400005) If we complete the reading in a fortnight, the verses read on a particular day of the week change from week to week.
('50', 247, 2, 19, 400122) It is true that completing it in a week means twice as much time every day.
('50', 247, 2, 20, 400198) If we read through the whole of the Gita at one time, we would take an hour and a quarter or an hour and a half.
('50', 247, 2, 21, 400311) At the rate of an hour and a half for the whole Gita, it will require six and a half minutes per day to complete the reading in fourteen days and l3 minutes per day to complete it in seven days.
('50', 247, 2, 22, 400506) Those who are interested in the reading will not grudge the extra 6_ minutes.
('50', 247, 2, 23, 400584) To those who are not interested, even the 6_ minutes being given to the reading at present are a burden.
('50', 247, 2, 24, 400689) This is Kakasahebs argument in support of his suggestion.
('50', 247, 2, 25, 400747) Both the suggestion and the argument appeal to me.
('50', 247, 2, 26, 400798) Think about them independently and, if they appeal to you, put them before the other members of the group and discuss
('50', 248, 0, 1, 400916) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 6 JANUARY, 1931 249
('50', 248, 1, 2, 400961) Discuss them with Mahadev if he is there.
('50', 248, 1, 3, 401003) Those who join in the reading voluntarily and with true understanding of its meaning should be consulted first.
('50', 248, 1, 4, 401115) If their view is against the suggestion, the matter need not be pursued further.
('50', 248, 1, 5, 401196) It should be put before the rest of the group only if they welcome it.
('50', 248, 1, 6, 401267) I have even prepared a time table for completing the reading in seven days.
('50', 248, 1, 7, 401343) I do not give it here just now.
('50', 248, 1, 8, 401375) I will send it if the suggestion is favourably received.
('50', 248, 1, 9, 401432) But no, there will be no need to write about it, for Kakasaheb will be there in two weeks time and he will personally explain the scheme.
('50', 248, 1, 10, 401570) I will add this, however.
('50', 248, 1, 11, 401596) I think it would be right to permit those who are not even today interested in the reading to leave the prayer meeting when the reading begins.
('50', 248, 1, 12, 401740) The reading always comes last, so that everyone will be present during the main part of the prayer, guests and visitors excepted of course.
('50', 248, 1, 13, 401880) In Wardha, and most probably in the Pratishthan too, they do the reading of the Gita in the same manner as we do at Sabarmati.
('50', 248, 1, 14, 402007) We should, therefore, find out whether the suggestion suits them too, and so I wrote last week to Vinoba and Hemprabhadevi.
('50', 248, 1, 15, 402131) As we understand better the importance of the devotional reading of the Gita and come to look upon the work as the lighthouse which guides our actions in life, we shall be less inclined to grudge the practice of completing the reading in one week.
('50', 248, 1, 16, 402379) Much will depend, of course, on the person who leads the reading.
('50', 248, 1, 17, 402445) If he puts his whole heart in it, he cannot but make it interesting.
('50', 248, 1, 18, 402514) If we meditate during the whole day on the chapter which was read at the prayer meeting, we shall discovernew meanings in it and understand better those which we know.
('50', 248, 2, 19, 402682) A mahavakya lends itself to ever new interpretations, and the Gita is a mahavakya.

('50', 249, 9, 18, 404087) I may say that it is only with the help of enema that I am able to keep well.
('50', 249, 9, 19, 404165) The enema water should be lukewarm and should be inserted slowly.
('50', 249, 9, 20, 404231) Soda bi carb and salt should be added to the water.

('50', 249, 9, 23, 404417) The abdomen should be massaged daily.

('50', 251, 3, 5, 405838) My sympathy goes out to you in your affliction and I should be glad indeed if this letter brings you any comfort.
('50', 251, 3, 6, 405952) In my opinion you are in no way to blame.
('50', 251, 3, 7, 405994) Having got the lady doctor you were quite right in trusting her.
('50', 251, 3, 8, 406059) I do not believe in constant change of doctors and hakims.
('50', 251, 3, 9, 406118) We must trust those whom we get to tell us when they need assistance or are in doubt as to their diagnosis.
('50', 251, 3, 10, 406226) Sometimes it may be found that the trust was misplaced.
('50', 251, 3, 11, 406282) But these are risks and chances of life which we must take always.
('50', 251, 3, 12, 406349) I hope therefore that you will not worry yourself over what you consider was your negligence.
('50', 251, 3, 13, 406443) This much you know yourself that you did not wilfully neglect anything.
('50', 251, 3, 14, 406515) More no man can do.
('50', 251, 4, 15, 406535) 1 This was in reply to a letter dated October 28, 1930 from Pyare Lal Govil, Sub Judge, Muzaffarnagar, U.P. He had lost his parents some 15 to 20 years ago and his only sister 16 years before writing.
('50', 251, 4, 16, 406736) Narrating the circumstances of the death of his only child, a 24 year old daughter, following a delivery, he wrote that the sepsis from which she was suffering could not be diagnosed in time.
('50', 251, 4, 17, 406928) He blamed himself for culpable mistakes resulting in her death.
('50', 251, 4, 18, 406992) He further wrote: If God has made destinies and every thing happens as has been fixed beforehand then there is no use in praying for mercy.
('50', 251, 4, 19, 407132) If He is powerless then He need not be approached.
('50', 251, 4, 20, 407183) The following shankas [doubts] arise: 1. What prayashchitta should I perform to wash off this sin of utter care lessness?
('50', 251, 4, 21, 407305) 2. How to give rest to her soul?
('50', 251, 4, 22, 407338) 3. Could she have not been saved if correct and timely help had been given?
('50', 251, 4, 23, 407414) 4. Is God powerless in changing the course of destinies?
('50', 251, 4, 24, 407471) If so then there is no use in prayer, nor in taking medicines nor in asking for medical help, or in making any efforts that way.
('50', 251, 4, 25, 407600) 5. Does a soul wander here and there for any length of time after departing from this body?
('50', 251, 4, 26, 407692) 6. How should and can I know that she has taken birth anywhere else?
('50', 251, 4, 27, 407761) 7. The idea that I have been very careless haunts me every moment, although I can swear that I did not know that I was making any mistake when I made them, else I would have never made them.
('50', 251, 4, 28, 407952) I do not know what had become of my discretion and sense.
('50', 251, 4, 29, 408010) Now I want nothing but I wish to know if I can in any way help her soul to get rest and stay in Heaven.
('50', 251, 4, 30, 408114) If so what should I do?
('50', 251, 4, 31, 408138) Very kindly give your ashirvad for the departed soul.
('50', 252, 0, 1, 408192) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 6 JANUARY, 1931 253
('50', 252, 1, 2, 408237) Now for the answers to your questions: (1) No prayashchitta is needed because in my opinion there was no carelessness on your part.
('50', 252, 1, 3, 408369) (2) No one can give rest to another soul.
('50', 252, 1, 4, 408411) Her rest will come from herself.
('50', 252, 1, 5, 408444) (3) It is impossible to say what would have happened if other assistance had been procured.
('50', 252, 1, 6, 408536) In spite of the ablest expert help kings have to die.
('50', 252, 1, 7, 408590) (4) There ought not to be much sorrow or fuss over an inevitable event.
('50', 252, 1, 8, 408662) Death is the lot of every created thing, nor need it be considered as a calamity.
('50', 252, 1, 9, 408744) Death is in reality a deliverance.
('50', 252, 1, 10, 408779) (5) What the soul does after discarding a body is in each case surmise but it is a certainty that the soul does not perish with the body.
('50', 252, 1, 11, 408917) Let us trust the laws of God or nature for the rest.
('50', 252, 1, 12, 408970) (6) States before birth and after death are invisible as the Gita affirms and experience confirms.
('50', 252, 1, 13, 409069) But we can infer from our present state that the condition after death is at least likely to be a second, though modified, edition of the present.
('50', 252, 1, 14, 409216) (7) We the survivors can certainly help the departed dear ones by wearing into our own lives all that was good in them.
('50', 252, 1, 15, 409336) For if they know anything of what happens here they must be consoled by the knowledge that we are treasuring their memories by adopting what was best in them.
('50', 252, 2, 16, 409495) Yours sincerely,
('50', 252, 3, 17, 409512) M. K. GANDHI [PS.] One question has been omitted by oversight.
('50', 252, 3, 18, 409575) God is never powerless.
('50', 252, 3, 19, 409599) But His laws are immutable.
('50', 252, 3, 20, 409627) We do not know them.
('50', 252, 3, 21, 409648) Nor do we know His will at a given moment.
('50', 252, 3, 22, 409691) Therefore we adopt within bounds such remedies as may commend themselves to us.
('50', 252, 3, 23, 409771) Prayer is to the God within.
('50', 252, 3, 24, 409800) It does not provoke God to change His will but it enables us to know His will which is everything.

('50', 253, 1, 2, 410015) 363. LETTER TO JAYAPRAKASH NARAYAN
('50', 253, 2, 3, 410050) YERAVDA JAIL, November 21, 1930
('50', 253, 3, 4, 410082) JAYAPRAKASH, Today I have sent you a telegram about Prabhavati which you will have received.
('50', 253, 3, 5, 410175) I await your reply.
('50', 253, 3, 6, 410195) 1 I hope you have sent her to the Ashram.
('50', 253, 3, 7, 410237) The best thing of course would be for you to go with her and have her fixed up there.
('50', 253, 3, 8, 410323) Any programme about her future work can be decided after she gets well.
('50', 253, 3, 9, 410395) I understand your sorrow.
('50', 253, 3, 10, 410421) I have thought over it.
('50', 253, 3, 11, 410445) You should not say anything to Prabhavati.
('50', 253, 3, 12, 410488) If she is moved by desire there will be no problem.
('50', 253, 3, 13, 410540) But if she has no stirrings of desire, it becomes your duty to protect her.
('50', 253, 3, 14, 410616) I need hardly remind you that women have as much right to freedom as men.
('50', 253, 3, 15, 410690) It is my firm opinion that if one partner in marriage has sexual urge it is by no means the duty of the other partner also to have such urge, though it is the right of the partner with the sexual urge to satisfy that urge.
('50', 253, 3, 16, 410913) This is perhaps one of the causes of polygamy.
('50', 253, 3, 17, 410960) Just as it will be considered immoral for a man to cohabit with a wife who is ill it should also be considered immoral to cohabit with a wife who has no sexual desire.
('50', 253, 3, 18, 411128) It is therefore my earnest advice that if Prabhavati has no craving for sex you should give her freedom and find yourself another wife.
('50', 253, 3, 19, 411264) I see no immorality in that.
('50', 253, 3, 20, 411293) After all what is to be done?
('50', 253, 3, 21, 411323) How can your craving be forcibly stifled?
('50', 253, 3, 22, 411365) You consider sex necessary and beneficial for the spirit.
('50', 253, 3, 23, 411423) In such a situation I would not consider a second marriage immoral from any point of view.
('50', 253, 3, 24, 411514) In fact I feel that your doing so may well set an example to others.
('50', 253, 3, 25, 411583) Many young men use force with their wives.
('50', 253, 3, 26, 411626) Others visit prostitutes.
('50', 253, 3, 27, 411652) Still others indulge in even worse practices.
('50', 253, 3, 28, 411698) Prabhavati has chosen to live the life of a virgin.
('50', 253, 3, 29, 411750) You do not wish to practise brahmacharya.
('50', 253, 3, 30, 411792) Therefore I see nothing wrong in your respecting the wishes of Prabhavati and finding yourself another wife.
('50', 253, 3, 31, 411901) If you cannot think of another woman, you should, for the sake of Prabhavati, observe brahmacharya.
('50', 253, 3, 32, 412001) If your love for prabhavati isreally true you will find that as soon as you go near her your sexual craving will subside.
('50', 253, 3, 33, 412123) I have placed my views before you.
('50', 253, 3, 34, 412158) Do as your duty bids you.
('50', 253, 3, 35, 412184) May God grant you the strength to do so.

('50', 254, 2, 3, 412461) November 22, 1930
('50', 254, 3, 4, 412479) MY DEAR ANAND, Do not mind the length of your letters.
('50', 254, 3, 5, 412534) You wont tire me at all.
('50', 254, 3, 6, 412559) Jairamdas says you still do not feel that you are supporting yourself.
('50', 254, 3, 7, 412630) You should throw off this tenderness.
('50', 254, 3, 8, 412668) What you are getting is not a donation; it is what you earn.
('50', 254, 3, 9, 412729) He who gives his best to the work he takes up and gets what he needs for living, earns it.
('50', 254, 3, 10, 412820) If you were leading a luxurious life and getting paid for it, I would myself say that you were not living correctly.
('50', 254, 3, 11, 412937) You must therefore get rid of this sensitiveness.
('50', 254, 3, 12, 412987) I am glad you had all those precious hours with Jairamdas.
('50', 254, 3, 13, 413046) The way to cultivate faith in God is to recognize our nothingness and thus be humble as a particle of dust.
('50', 254, 3, 14, 413154) You know the prayer to Mother Earth in our morning verses.
('50', 254, 3, 15, 413213) The best of us at his very best is a tiny thing and utterly helpless.
('50', 254, 3, 16, 413283) And yet we are not so helpless the moment we know that we are sparks `from the Divine which is in us.
('50', 254, 3, 17, 413385) Faith does not come from reason.
('50', 254, 3, 18, 413418) Faith is believing.
('50', 254, 3, 19, 413438) Believe in God because those whose names we hold sacred have believed and testified.
('50', 254, 3, 20, 413523) You will keep up a respectful correspondence with Father even though you may scent coldness on his part at times.
('50', 254, 3, 21, 413637) Yours BAPU [PS.] If you see Acharya .
('50', 254, 3, 22, 413675) 1 well.
('50', 254, 3, 23, 413683) And remember me to Dr. Choithram 2 and Malkani 3. Where is Jairamdas kept?
('50', 254, 3, 24, 413758) About Vidya in my letter to her.
('50', 254, 3, 25, 413791) Does she or do you understand that letter?

('50', 255, 2, 4, 414236) When you write, you should give me news about Jamnadas too.
('50', 255, 2, 5, 414296) Convey my respectful greetings to Grandfather and Grandmother.
('50', 255, 2, 6, 414359) I think about both of them every day and pray for their blessings.

('50', 255, 8, 13, 414662) KUSUM (SENIOR), I have your letter.
('50', 255, 8, 14, 414698) If you will only realize that the verses 1 are a part of our prayers and that, therefore, we should learn them by heart, you will be able with some effort to get absorbed in them.
('50', 255, 8, 15, 414878) You should not lose heart if you do not succeed in the effort.
('50', 255, 8, 16, 414941) All those who recite them do not become absorbed in them.
('50', 255, 8, 17, 414999) If, however, you continue to have faith and recite them, one day you will find that you can become absorbed in them.
('50', 255, 8, 18, 415116) Moreover, the verses have a deep meaning.
('50', 255, 8, 19, 415158) If you meditate over it, that, too, will help you to concentrate on them.

('50', 256, 4, 5, 415438) I have your letter.
('50', 256, 4, 6, 415458) I think my memory is as weak as yours, but this is the method I followed, and still follow, for memorizing whatever I did, or do when I get any time for that, and I have no doubt that it is the best one.
('50', 256, 4, 7, 415662) We should first try and understand the meaning of what we wish to memorize and the relations of the different parts to each other.
('50', 256, 4, 8, 415793) After we have done this, all that remains to do is to commit to memory the poets words expressing that meaning and those relations.
('50', 256, 4, 9, 415925) This is easy to do.
('50', 256, 4, 10, 415945) Try this method and memorize Chapter XII.
('50', 256, 4, 11, 415987) Arjuna asks: As between one who worships in this manner and another who worships the Unmanifest, who is superior? Reflect over the reply to this question and then try to memorize the verses.
('50', 256, 4, 12, 416178) This is interesting, involves no waste of energy and, because we have faith, the meaning sinks in our heart while we try to memorize the verses.

('50', 256, 11, 20, 416567) Make a patient effort and improve it.

('50', 258, 1, 4, 418413) We should remember that marriage is a universallyaccepted religious institution intended to put a restraint on gratification of lust, and limit the field of choice for individuals.

('50', 258, 7, 10, 418745) MATHURI, There are two reasons why you do not like to spin.
('50', 258, 7, 11, 418805) One, you do not realize that it is for the sake of the poor nor do you know the poverty of the hunger stricken.
('50', 258, 7, 12, 418917) Two, you are not good at spinning.
('50', 258, 7, 13, 418952) Therefore, know the poor and if you understand our duty to have compassion for the poor you will be interested without any effort.
('50', 258, 7, 14, 419083) Then you will feel that you should spin as much as you can and as well as you can because you will be spinning for them.

('50', 258, 12, 19, 419323) MIRA, It was bad to have got fever again.
('50', 258, 12, 20, 419365) But I suppose it is no use fretting over it.
('50', 258, 12, 21, 419410) There is undoubtedly poison in your system.
('50', 258, 12, 22, 419454) It upsets it on the slightest pretext.
('50', 258, 12, 23, 419493) Whenever possible trace the cause and avoid it in future.
('50', 258, 12, 24, 419551) If it is rest that is needed and if you cannot take it at the Ashram take it where you think you can get it.
('50', 258, 12, 25, 419660) You may even go to Vijapur where Chhaganlal is or some such quiet place.
('50', 258, 12, 26, 419733) Even a weeks change may set you up.
('50', 258, 12, 27, 419769) You will be pleased to hear that I have set the Bihar wheel going.
('50', 258, 12, 28, 419836) I followed your instructions and it went.
('50', 258, 12, 29, 419878) The holders required attention.
('50', 258, 12, 30, 419910) I opened out the holes.

('50', 259, 1, 2, 420012) making experiments with the Gandiv which still gives promise of possibilities.
('50', 259, 1, 3, 420091) I am describing the changes in my letter to Keshu.
('50', 259, 1, 4, 420142) Iwould speak to you about the Bihar wheel.
('50', 259, 1, 5, 420185) The alteration you have made doesnt seem to me to have added to the utility of the wheel.
('50', 259, 1, 6, 420275) The original length of the platform is the ideal length.
('50', 259, 1, 7, 420332) The length in the improved machine is too much for drawing the thread away from you and too little for drawing it towards you.
('50', 259, 1, 8, 420459) The original holders may admit of a change.
('50', 259, 1, 9, 420503) I am trying the coir holders in the Gandiv and they have worked exceedingly well.
('50', 259, 1, 10, 420585) In the coir holders the spindle moves in the rough and smooth convex surface of the coir twine.
('50', 259, 1, 11, 420681) Hence it moves with the minimum of friction.
('50', 259, 1, 12, 420726) In the Bihar holders the spindle moves lazily on 1/8th inch flat surface.
('50', 259, 1, 13, 420800) Hence there is avoidable friction.
('50', 259, 1, 14, 420835) The coir holders undoubtedly last long, take no time to make and hold oil better.
('50', 259, 1, 15, 420917) Coir twine is available anywhere.
('50', 259, 1, 16, 420951) It can be picked from waste.
('50', 259, 1, 17, 420980) These hints are for you to note and follow out where you have leisure.
('50', 259, 1, 18, 421051) Another good piece of news.
('50', 259, 1, 19, 421079) For the last three days I have been trying one of the taklis you left here.
('50', 259, 1, 20, 421155) It is giving me more satisfaction than the one I have made and on which I was working.
('50', 259, 1, 21, 421242) The mouth of mine is wretchedly made.
('50', 259, 1, 22, 421280) Yours is much better.
('50', 259, 1, 23, 421302) I read today the translation of my summary of the first chapter of the Gita.
('50', 259, 1, 24, 421379) I can trace your hand in it.

('50', 259, 6, 30, 421586) The remedy for your ill health is hipbath and sun bath.
('50', 259, 6, 31, 421642) Ramanama is prescribed for peace of mind.
('50', 259, 6, 32, 421684) If sexual desire disturbs you, you should suppress it.
('50', 259, 6, 33, 421739) There is only one way of staying near the Divine Light, namely, to serve the children of God.
('50', 259, 6, 34, 421833) That Light cannot point any other way.

('50', 260, 3, 6, 422257) In a way, it is a pleasant game.

('50', 260, 3, 8, 422349) one can even beat it up and, if one feels so inclined, one can bow to it.
('50', 260, 3, 9, 422423) Moreover, a photograph will have only as many virtues as we imagine it to have.

('50', 260, 9, 22, 423081) I had sent a wire to Jayaprakash asking him to send you to the Ashram.

('50', 262, 3, 4, 424743) HARILAL (DESAI), I have your frank letter.
('50', 262, 3, 5, 424786) I understand what you say regarding the marriage.
('50', 262, 3, 6, 424836) Has the man any children?
('50', 262, 3, 7, 424862) Is his mother alive?
('50', 262, 3, 8, 424883) Has Hari ichchha gone to her husbands house?
('50', 262, 3, 9, 424928) It was certainly wrong of you to have given up the tannery work.
('50', 262, 3, 10, 424993) I see in your action a weakness common in our society.
('50', 262, 3, 11, 425048) The reasons to which you yielded while leaving the work were before you when you took it up.
('50', 262, 3, 12, 425141) Only yesterday, while I was translating Prayer No.
('50', 262, 3, 13, 425192) 127, I read the following verse in it; Revolve the thing in your mind carefully before you act, Never go to fight in a battle in blind rivalry of others, If you go, fight till you are hewn to pieces.
('50', 262, 3, 14, 425392) If you break your vow once, you will not know where to end.
('50', 262, 3, 15, 425452) You have also not properly understood your duty to your mother.
('50', 262, 3, 16, 425516) Suppose a mother belongs to a society in which drinking is common.
('50', 262, 3, 17, 425583) Her son gives it up as an evil, but the mother tries to dissuade him from doing so, and threatens to commit suicide if the son gives up drinking.
('50', 262, 3, 18, 425729) In these circumstances, is it the duty of the son to give up what he regards as his duty?
('50', 262, 3, 19, 425819) To honour the word given by Dasharatha, Rama left for the forest and let Dasharatha die.
('50', 262, 3, 20, 425908) Though Kaikeyi entreated Bharata with piteous tears, Bharata clung to his decision not to accept the throne.
('50', 262, 3, 21, 426017) Judging by common standards, had Kaikeyi done anything wrong?
('50', 262, 3, 22, 426079) She was one of the many queens, and in any case she had her husbands word.
('50', 262, 3, 23, 426154) What sin had she committed in demanding the throne for her son?
('50', 262, 3, 24, 426218) But Bharata saw sin in her action and disregarded her entreaties.
('50', 262, 3, 25, 426284) I have not written this to reproach you.
('50', 262, 3, 26, 426325) I cannot feel angry with you.
('50', 262, 3, 27, 426355) I have written what I have done because I thought it my duty to explain to you what your duty was.

('50', 263, 3, 6, 426682) I dont always remember the reasons behind my decisions.
('50', 263, 3, 7, 426738) You have proved yourself a true soldier.
('50', 263, 3, 8, 426779) It is a mistake if you believe that, by remaining there, you are not doing a soldiers duty.
('50', 263, 3, 9, 426871) All persons are not sent to the front.
('50', 263, 3, 10, 426910) Many recruits are kept in reserve.
('50', 263, 3, 11, 426945) Moreover, very responsible persons are required at the head quarters.
('50', 263, 3, 12, 427015) One must of course give up fear of danger and face it whenever it comes.
('50', 263, 3, 13, 427088) But anyone who needlessly rushes into danger is not a soldier but a fool.
('50', 263, 3, 14, 427162) I look upon Narandas as a true soldier.
('50', 263, 3, 15, 427202) Who knows what dangers are in store for you?
('50', 263, 3, 16, 427247) True soldiership lies in abiding by Gods will.
('50', 263, 3, 17, 427294) That is non attachment.
('50', 263, 3, 18, 427318) If we express that idea in common language, it means that we should act as ordered by the general to whose discipline we have voluntarily submitted ourselves.
('50', 263, 3, 19, 427477) The Ashram children have complained in their letter against Dharmakumar, that he is dirty.

('50', 263, 3, 22, 427618) I understand your view about the ceremonial recitation of the Gita.
('50', 263, 3, 23, 427686) On this issue you may quarrel with Kakasaheb to your hearts content.
('50', 263, 3, 24, 427755) Personally, I think that at the back of your opposition to the proposal is your aversion to or lack of faith in the prayers themselves.
('50', 263, 3, 25, 427891) If you had your way, I think you would have nothing besides the dhun.
('50', 263, 3, 26, 427961) I would advise you to have faith in all the items of the prayers.
('50', 263, 3, 27, 428027) If possible, concentrate your attention on the meaning of each item.
('50', 263, 3, 28, 428096) If you cannot do that, have faith that the words you hear are noble and that even the fact of listening to them will do you good, and attend to them respectfully.
('50', 263, 3, 29, 428259) Please do not understand from this that I wish to convert you to the proposal for completing the recitation in seven days.
('50', 263, 3, 30, 428382) I have written this to convince you that there is some meaning inthe prayers behind which lies fifteen years tapascharya, with unswerving faith, on the part of some of us.

('50', 265, 3, 4, 429673) AMINA, I have a letter from you after many days.
('50', 265, 3, 5, 429722) I have heard about Qureshi having gone to jail again.
('50', 265, 3, 6, 429776) He has done the right thing.
('50', 265, 3, 7, 429805) Have all of you been able to keep yourselves well in Dhandhuka?
('50', 265, 3, 8, 429869) Is it colder there or less cold [than in Ahmedabad].
('50', 265, 3, 9, 429922) Do you ever go out for a walk?

('50', 265, 9, 15, 430120) MATHURADAS, The question is this: Vithal says that it is not necessary to rub [the string] with leaves if it has been rubbed with candle wax.
('50', 265, 9, 16, 430262) You say it is necessary.
('50', 265, 9, 17, 430287) If it is, why is it?
('50', 265, 9, 18, 430308) Vithal should correct his error.
('50', 265, 9, 19, 430341) We find that rubbing with candle wax is enough.
('50', 265, 9, 20, 430389) The cotton does not stick [to the string].

('50', 265, 15, 26, 430571) As far as possible avoid things containing chillies.
('50', 265, 15, 27, 430624) If there are chillies in dal and vegetables, you must not of course eat the dal, indeed you should also avoid the vegetables.

('50', 266, 1, 3, 430864) Or you can have the roti just with salt.
('50', 266, 1, 4, 430905) You will be able to carry on like this for some time at least.

('50', 266, 7, 14, 431275) HEMPRABHA, I have your letter 1. Satis Babus discourse is excellent.
('50', 266, 7, 15, 431344) It expresses well his mental state.
('50', 266, 7, 16, 431380) Those desirous of living as inmates of Sodepur Ashram should scrupulously observe the Ashram regulat ions.
('50', 266, 7, 17, 431487) If you cannot have such people, you may run it with paid workers or close it down.
('50', 266, 7, 18, 431570) Herein lies our test.
('50', 266, 7, 19, 431592) To what extent it is right to run it through paid workers is a different matter.
('50', 266, 7, 20, 431673) Let us hope such an occasion never arises.
('50', 266, 7, 21, 431716) The running or the closure of the Ashram rests with God.

('50', 266, 11, 24, 431829) 1 The addressee in her letter had expressed disillusionment about the sincerity of the Ashram workers.
('50', 266, 11, 25, 431932) In the absence of Satis Chandra Das Gupta, she was attempting to run the Ashram on her own.
('50', 266, 11, 26, 432024) She had expressed the possibility of employing paid workers if the efforts of the Ashram inmates were inadequate, and had enclosed extracts from a letter from Satis Chandra Das Gupta which was more in the nature of a discourse upon Tarinis death.

('50', 267, 1, 2, 432328) 386. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('50', 267, 2, 3, 432359) At night, November 21/25, 1930
('50', 267, 3, 4, 432390) NARANDAS, I got your letter on Thursday (20th) morning.
('50', 267, 3, 5, 432446) You should not forward any letters unopened.
('50', 267, 3, 6, 432491) Open every letter before forwarding it.
('50', 267, 3, 7, 432531) You may not read the letter, if the correspondent so desires, but even that on the understanding that the correspondent should write about no subject which is forbidden.
('50', 267, 3, 8, 432701) Confidential letters, therefore, should be about personal matters only.
('50', 267, 3, 9, 432773) Adhere to the method which you have been following.
('50', 267, 3, 10, 432825) It is certainly a painful matter that undesirable freedom was taken in several respects at the time of Hari ichchhas marriage,but you did right in tolerating everything patiently and giving all possible help.
('50', 267, 3, 11, 433034) Sometimes dharma lies in setting aside such rules.
('50', 267, 3, 12, 433085) The attitude which you adopted was inspired by the spirit of non violence.
('50', 267, 3, 13, 433160) A principle has no exception.
('50', 267, 3, 14, 433190) When, however, the rules and regulations framed to embody a principle are felt to kill its spirit, they may be set aside.
('50', 267, 3, 15, 433312) The occasion of Hari ichchhas marriage was of this kind.
('50', 267, 3, 16, 433369) At the present time I have dedicated myself heart and soul to spinning and other related processes, and I find myself constantly thinking about the subject.
('50', 267, 3, 17, 433526) Since we do spinning as a form of yajna, we should be very exact and regular in doing it, display the utmost perseverance and sincerity in our work and become very proficient in it.
('50', 267, 3, 18, 433708) Most of us have no knowledge of even some elementary things about spinning.
('50', 267, 3, 19, 433784) We should acquire it now.
('50', 267, 3, 20, 433810) That is, everyone should be able to ascertain the count, strength and evenness of his or her yarn and keep a record of these.
('50', 267, 3, 21, 433936) One should also keep a record of the time spent every day.
('50', 267, 3, 22, 433995) If we do these things habitually, they will take very little time.
('50', 267, 3, 23, 434062) Everyone should pay attention to increasing his or her speed, but without wasting yarn.
('50', 267, 3, 24, 434150) People should also learn to keep the spinning wheel in repair.
('50', 267, 3, 25, 434213) That is, they should know how to make the belt, jotar and spindle holder.
('50', 267, 3, 26, 434287) They should know about the different models of spinning wheels.
('50', 267, 3, 27, 434351) But you should not be burdened with the task of thinking about all these matters and getting people to carry out my suggestions.
('50', 267, 3, 28, 434480) I have nothing else to engage my attention, but you
('50', 268, 0, 1, 434532) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 6 JANUARY, 1931 269
('50', 268, 1, 2, 434577) have to face new responsibilities and problems every day.
('50', 268, 1, 3, 434635) These suggestions, therefore, should not impose a burden on you.
('50', 268, 1, 4, 434700) You may carry out, and persuade others to carry out, only those suggestions which people can easily take up and act upon.
('50', 268, 1, 5, 434822) Other people, too, should concern themselves with these things and think about them.
('50', 268, 1, 6, 434907) Everyone should do what his interest and capacity incline him or permit him to do.
('50', 268, 1, 7, 434990) You will find in the letter to Lakshmidas a description of my experience in this regard too; please read it.
('50', 268, 1, 8, 435099) Saturday morning
('50', 268, 2, 9, 435116) You have given a pleasing description of the service you are doing.
('50', 268, 2, 10, 435184) Take care that you do not fall ill through all this labour.
('50', 268, 2, 11, 435244) You have the spirit of non attachment in you in good measure.
('50', 268, 2, 12, 435306) There is little likelihood, therefore, of your falling ill.
('50', 268, 2, 13, 435366) Krishna is bound to protect those who dedicate their work of service to Him.
('50', 268, 2, 14, 435443) Your losing weight is a good sign indeed.
('50', 268, 2, 15, 435485) You have had a good crop of fruit in theAshram.Mathew has not described what freedom he takes.
('50', 268, 2, 16, 435580) He has merely stated that he takes freedom.
('50', 268, 2, 17, 435624) If you know in what respect, let me know.
('50', 268, 2, 18, 435666) We keep him in the Ashram because he is a good man.
('50', 268, 2, 19, 435718) I, too, believe that he will come round some day.
('50', 268, 2, 20, 435768) When you have no time because of pressure of work, it will suffice if you write only a few lines.
('50', 268, 2, 21, 435866) You will find it easier if you write down from time to time what you think you must tell me.
('50', 268, 2, 22, 435959) Dont you see that that is what I do here, though I am not as busy as you are?
('50', 268, 2, 23, 436037) I dont depart from my daily routine in order to write these letters.
('50', 268, 2, 24, 436106) That routine, of course, concerns the hours of meals, sleeping, answering the call of nature and spinning.
('50', 268, 2, 25, 436213) The hours which are not taken up by these activities are practically all spent in writing letters, except on Tuesday.
('50', 268, 2, 26, 436331) I know that you can arrange properly all your work, but even then I feel tempted to write this.
('50', 268, 2, 27, 436427) It is also a test of non attachment to work, that a person who has cultivated it will not feel that he is working under pressure even when he is busy with a variety of tasks.
('50', 268, 2, 28, 436602) There is an excellent thought in an English saying.
('50', 268, 2, 29, 436654) It is that a busy man can always spare time for others.
('50', 268, 2, 30, 436710) The point is that such a person, even though working hard, is always found as fresh as if he had no work and no one is disappointed by him.
('50', 268, 2, 31, 436850) I was very happy that you could take in Dhiru and Vimu.
('50', 268, 2, 32, 436906) It was also good that those two children felt drawn to the Ashram of their own accord.
('50', 268, 2, 33, 436993) Let me know how Dhiru behaves now.
('50', 269, 0, 1, 437028) 270 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 269, 1, 2, 437070) Amidass experiment is worth watching.
('50', 269, 1, 3, 437108) From here, I see an error in it.
('50', 269, 1, 4, 437141) If he does no work and rests all the time, he can certainly live on fruit, but his experiment will not have succeeded.
('50', 269, 1, 5, 437260) That is right food for the body which gives it the necessary strength for the ordinary duties of service.
('50', 269, 1, 6, 437366) To get such strength, he should be able to digest almonds and such other tissue building foods.
('50', 269, 1, 7, 437462) My experience so far tells me that a weak stomach cannot digest foods like almond, whereas it can digest the same nutrients from milk.
('50', 269, 1, 8, 437597) However, I dont wish to write about this to Amidas or suggest it indirectly to him.
('50', 269, 1, 9, 437681) His sincere faith will probably give him the required light.
('50', 269, 1, 10, 437742) Let us hope that he will correct his mistake, if he is making any, and that he will learn from his experience the value of milk or discover some vegetarian substances similar in value to foods of animal origin.
('50', 269, 1, 11, 437953) .s 1 case is a sad one.
('50', 269, 1, 12, 437977) I did feel something unattractive on his face, but I believed that he was a good man and used to dismissthe other thought from my mind.
('50', 269, 1, 13, 438113) And I was right in doing that.
('50', 269, 1, 14, 438144) Even when he fell at times, he continued to struggle and it is possible that he has succeeded in his struggle by now.
('50', 269, 1, 15, 438262) If so, the expression on his face may also have changed.
('50', 269, 1, 16, 438319) It was said about Socrates that till the last his face did not seem like a good mans.
('50', 269, 1, 17, 438405) There is, therefore, only one path for creatures like us who are always liable to error.
('50', 269, 1, 18, 438494) We should always assume a man to be good till we come to know something against him.
('50', 269, 1, 19, 438579) Give me the names of Chandrakantas father and mother.
('50', 269, 1, 20, 438633) I will then write slips for them.
('50', 269, 1, 21, 438667) What you have written to them is right.
('50', 269, 1, 22, 438707) They ought to give up worrying about her.
('50', 269, 1, 23, 438749) It would be best if Kantas mother does not come to the Ashram.
('50', 269, 1, 24, 438812) She will probably be a burden on Gangabehn.
('50', 269, 1, 25, 438856) Punjabhais becoming unconscious occasionally is Gods grace.
('50', 269, 1, 26, 438916) That seems to give him some rest.
('50', 269, 1, 27, 438950) It would be best if Champas delivery takes place in the hospital to which Amina was admitted.
('50', 269, 1, 28, 439044) She will get all facilities there and will be well looked after, and nobody else will be put to trouble.
('50', 269, 1, 29, 439149) Some woman or other who can be spared from the Ashram may visit her from time to time and stay with her.
('50', 269, 1, 30, 439254) If this is possible, suggest it to Champa.
('50', 269, 1, 31, 439297) If she agrees, she will find the arrangement convenient.
('50', 269, 1, 32, 439354) Monday morning, November 24, 1930 Most probably I wrote to you that I had received the bark sheet sent by Ratubhai.
('50', 269, 1, 33, 439470) I used it till this day as a covering when sleeping,

('50', 270, 1, 2, 439597) but it has not become soft.
('50', 270, 1, 3, 439625) I do not know whether or not it can be washed.
('50', 270, 1, 4, 439672) As it remains stiff, I thought it would be more useful for spreading on the floor and that is what I have started doing from today.
('50', 270, 1, 5, 439804) I am sitting on it just now.
('50', 270, 1, 6, 439833) Vinoba tells me in his letter that he has sent two taklis.
('50', 270, 1, 7, 439892) I have made inquiries.
('50', 270, 1, 8, 439915) They do not seem to have been received here so far.
('50', 270, 1, 9, 439967) I wonder if they have been received there.
('50', 270, 1, 10, 440010) If you have received them, send them here.
('50', 270, 2, 11, 440053) I call this chapter the key to an understanding of the Gita, and the gist of it is that life is given us for service and not for enjoyment.
('50', 270, 2, 12, 440193) We have therefore to impart a sacrificial character to our lives.
('50', 270, 2, 13, 440259) Intellectual assent to this proposition is only the first step, but such assent and conduct in terms of that assent are bound to rid our heart of its impurities in course of time.
('50', 270, 2, 14, 440439) But what is real service?
('50', 270, 2, 15, 440465) In order to obtain the right answer to this question, restraint of the sensesis essential, as it gives us a clearer and clearer vision of the God of truth.
('50', 270, 2, 16, 440621) Service rendered with selfish motives ceases to be sacrifice.
('50', 270, 2, 17, 440683) Hence the urgent need for the spirit of detachment.
('50', 270, 2, 18, 440735) When this is understood, all manner of controversies lose their meaning for us.
('50', 270, 2, 19, 440815) Did Krishna really ask Arjuna to kill his relatives?
('50', 270, 2, 20, 440868) Could such killing ever be a part of ones duty? Questions like these are set at rest for ever.
('50', 270, 2, 21, 440963) When detachment governs our actions, even the weapon raised in order to strike an enemy down falls out of our hand.
('50', 270, 2, 22, 441079) But a mere pretence of detachment serves no useful purpose.
('50', 270, 2, 23, 441139) If only we persevere in our effort, detachment may come to us perhaps the very first day, or maybe only after a thousand years.
('50', 270, 2, 24, 441267) We must not worry over the time this takes, for the effort carries within itself the seeds of success.
('50', 270, 2, 25, 441370) We must however be on our guard and make sure that it is a genuine effort, and that there is no self deception.
('50', 270, 2, 26, 441482) And this is certainly possible for us all.
('50', 270, 2, 27, 441525) I have thus been able to complete Chapter III in two parts.
('50', 270, 2, 28, 441585) I have now fifteen minutes left to me in which to finish this letter.
('50', 270, 2, 29, 441655) The title you have suggested for these discourses is rather long.
('50', 270, 2, 30, 441721) It seems you propose to publish them one by one.
('50', 270, 2, 31, 441770) Kaka suggests a short title Gitabodh 2. I like it.
('50', 270, 2, 32, 441821) The intention behind the present attempt is that it may help those who read the discourses to understand the meaning of

('50', 271, 1, 2, 442085) the Gita as I have understood it.
('50', 271, 1, 3, 442119) I dont know whether I shall succeed in my aim.
('50', 271, 1, 4, 442166) But that is the intention behind my attempt and, therefore, the title Gitabodh suits the discourses very well.
('50', 271, 1, 5, 442277) I doubt the necessity of an English translation of these discourses.
('50', 271, 1, 6, 442346) But the final decision can only be made there.
('50', 271, 1, 7, 442393) As for the suggestion to complete the devotional reading of the Gita in a week, Kakasaheb will now discuss it personally.
('50', 271, 1, 8, 442515) If no one likes the idea, we certainly dont wish to act upon it.

('50', 271, 3, 10, 442595) BAPU After 8 a.m., Tuesday [PS.] Dudhabhai is in jail.
('50', 271, 3, 11, 442650) Ascertain in which jail.
('50', 271, 3, 12, 442675) If he is in Sabarmati Jail, someone should go and visit him.
('50', 271, 3, 13, 442736) Where hasSomabhai taken up work?
('50', 271, 3, 14, 442769) I wrote to Jairamdas and told him that I was not eating fresh fruits.
('50', 271, 3, 15, 442839) My reason for doing so was that there was a statement by the lathi Department 1 of the Government that it was not true that I had given up eating fresh fruits in protest against lathi charges and that I still ate them.
('50', 271, 3, 16, 443058) I have already told you what I eat.
('50', 271, 3, 17, 443094) However, I give here the history so far, so that, if an occasion arises, you may issue an authoritative rejoinder.
('50', 271, 3, 18, 443209) I had given up fresh fruit for the most part during the salt march.
('50', 271, 3, 19, 443277) I had resumed it after I was brought here.
('50', 271, 3, 20, 443320) But I gave it up after I heard about lathi charges.
('50', 271, 3, 21, 443372) I must have accepted it for three or four days when I heard about the lathi charges.
('50', 271, 3, 22, 443457) That was the position when Jairamdas met me.
('50', 271, 3, 23, 443502) After that, with a view to overcoming constipation and saving expenditure, I gave up the dry fruits which I had been eating, namely, dates, currants and raisins and started eating vegetables only.
('50', 271, 3, 24, 443699) For some days I ate both fruit and vegetables and then went over exclusively to vegetables, but realized that I could not keep fit on them alone.
('50', 271, 3, 25, 443845) So I again went back to dates and raisins.
('50', 271, 3, 26, 443888) Among the vegetables, I used to be supplied unripe papaiya.
('50', 271, 3, 27, 443948) Sometimes the papaiya would be ripe and I would eat that too.
('50', 271, 3, 28, 444010) This did not happen while Jairamdas was here.
('50', 271, 3, 29, 444056) I must have accepted about ten times ripe papaiya supplied from the garden here.
('50', 271, 3, 30, 444137) Lemon, I of course take every day, and Jairamdas has mentioned the fact.
('50', 271, 3, 31, 444210) His statement, therefore, is quite correct and the Governments on the whole incorrect.
('50', 271, 3, 32, 444297) It is only recently that I have been receiving papaiya
('50', 271, 4, 33, 444352) 1 Probably the Home Department
('50', 272, 0, 1, 444383) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 6 JANUARY, 1931 273
('50', 272, 1, 2, 444428) and no one can say, because I eat it, that I live on fresh fruit.
('50', 272, 1, 3, 444494) Probably no official knows about this fact at all, for the papaiya is supplied to me along with raw vegetables.
('50', 272, 1, 4, 444606) It is never bought from the market.
('50', 272, 1, 5, 444642) This is the position.
('50', 272, 1, 6, 444664) Kakasaheb will be released on the 29th and he will of course state the correct position more clearly.
('50', 272, 1, 7, 444766) My belief is that the Government official [responsible for the statement] has made no distinction between fresh and dry fruits or that he has assumed, from my having accepted a basket of fruit which may have been brought by a visitor and which I may have passed on to Kakasaheb, that I myself had eaten the fruit.
('50', 272, 1, 8, 445080) God alone knows how the statement came to be issued.
('50', 272, 1, 9, 445133) If no controversy follows, you need not go out of your way to issue any statement.

('50', 272, 6, 16, 445484) Though late, the cutting off of Vimalas hair is to be welcomed.
('50', 272, 6, 17, 445548) Everything has its own appointed time.
('50', 272, 6, 18, 445587) You need not feel sorry that you did not get her hair cut off earlier.
('50', 272, 6, 19, 445658) The idea was so completely new that it is not surprising that a mother should not accept it readily.
('50', 272, 6, 20, 445759) It is best that you should accept anything I may suggest only if you are convinced about it; you will then cling to it.

('50', 273, 3, 6, 446254) Either you yourself should go and live with her or engage a servant who would look after her.
('50', 273, 3, 7, 446348) Which of the two courses it is your dharma to adopt, your heart alone can tell you.

('50', 274, 3, 7, 447339) People are selfish and are simply not interested in keeping cows.

('50', 274, 9, 16, 447649) JAYAPRAKASH, When I think of Prabhavati I feel that the sooner she goes to the Ashram the better it will be.
('50', 274, 9, 17, 447758) That she will go to the Ashram if she does not recover will mean that she will go when her illness has become worse.
('50', 274, 9, 18, 447875) You who have been educated in the West should understand that illness should be tackled at its inception.
('50', 274, 9, 19, 447981) I have known cases of hysteria where recovery was effected by the transfer of the patient to a different place.
('50', 274, 9, 20, 448093) In Prabhavatis case it is doubly necessary that she should have a change of weather.
('50', 274, 9, 21, 448178) She is ailing and she is also faced with a moral crisis.
('50', 274, 9, 22, 448235) In a freer atmosphere she will be better able to know her heart and she will also discover her duty.
('50', 274, 9, 23, 448336) The difficult question before you is that of freedom of women.
('50', 274, 9, 24, 448399) If Prabhavati has as much freedom as you, you must concede to her the right to think for herself.

('50', 275, 3, 4, 448698) RAMDAS, I have your letter.
('50', 275, 3, 5, 448726) Many children suffer when they cut teeth.
('50', 275, 3, 6, 448768) Hence it is nothing strange that she does too.
('50', 275, 3, 7, 448815) But her cold should go.
('50', 275, 3, 8, 448839) Somebody should carry her and walk in the sunshine.
('50', 275, 3, 9, 448891) The head should be kept covered.
('50', 275, 3, 10, 448924) This will warm up the skin and make it less sensitive.
('50', 275, 3, 11, 448979) I believe the cold will then disappear.
('50', 275, 3, 12, 449019) Once you have formed the habit of keeping accounts, you dont find it a burden to do so and discover through experience the very great value of the practice.
('50', 275, 3, 13, 449176) Whether or not ones life is peaceful should make no difference in this matter.
('50', 275, 3, 14, 449255) There are some things which we should try hard and learn to do with a peaceful mind even in the midst of highly distracting circumstances.

('50', 275, 9, 21, 449582) I posted a letter to you yesterday to Sitabadiyara.
('50', 275, 9, 22, 449634) This too I hope you will get.
('50', 275, 9, 23, 449664) If your health improves there, I have nothing more to say about it.
('50', 275, 9, 24, 449732) It will not, however, be good sense to go to the Ashram after your health is nearly ruined.
('50', 275, 9, 25, 449824) While improvement is still possible, you will recover if you go and stay there for some time.
('50', 275, 9, 26, 449918) Then you will also have some peace of mind to think about your problems and be able to judge what your duty is.
('50', 275, 9, 27, 450030) You should know that you are not subject to anyones authority.
('50', 275, 9, 28, 450093) It is we who make ourselves free or subject to someones authority.

('50', 278, 6, 9, 453494) [Before November 29, 1930]
('50', 278, 7, 10, 453521) Our civil disobedience is fulfilled when we seek imprisonment.
('50', 278, 7, 11, 453584) Disobedience would cease to be civil if we defied legitimate jail discipline.
('50', 278, 7, 12, 453662) We may not therefore shout or create a row in the jails.
('50', 278, 7, 13, 453719) We may not refuse work when it is demanded of us according to rules.
('50', 278, 7, 14, 453788) We should rather be anxious to do as much work as we can and that too as efficiently as we are capable of.
('50', 278, 7, 15, 453895) It would be nice if even simple prisoners volunteered to do some useful work not necessarily with a view to getting any remission.

('50', 278, 8, 18, 454131) On the basis of the discussions he had with Gandhiji before his release on November 29, 1930, he observed: He does not think himself competent enough to guide the political struggle today because he is removed from the field of action.
('50', 278, 8, 19, 454367) To a satyagrahi, imprisonment is a civil death.
('50', 278, 8, 20, 454415) But as a prisoner he can give authoritative instructions for prospective satyagrahi prisoners.
('50', 278, 8, 21, 454510) Daring my stay with him in the Yeravda jail I discussed with him various aspects of the jail life and elicited from him some useful instructions.
('50', 278, 8, 22, 454656) He had no objections to my sharing them with workers in the cause of swaraj.

('50', 278, 8, 24, 454772) A satyagrahi should realize that his antagonism or disobedience ceases as soon as he is convicted by the court.
('50', 278, 8, 25, 454884) He is not out to paralyse jail discipline.
('50', 278, 8, 26, 454927) In war, a prisoner lays down his arms and capitulates when he is caught.
('50', 278, 8, 27, 455000) The enemy can always rely on the words of a true soldier prisoner.
('50', 278, 8, 28, 455067) A prisoner of war would not try to escape, would not try to deceive when he is allowed an amount of liberty on the strength of his word of honour.
('50', 278, 8, 29, 455214) We, as satyagrahis, should try to be ideal prisoners in jails.
('50', 278, 8, 30, 455277) We must always be prepared to abide by the rules of jail discipline so long as they do not go against the ordinary canons of humanity and self respect.
('50', 278, 8, 31, 455429) I have sometimes heard some young satyagrahis arguing against submitting to jail discipline.
('50', 278, 8, 32, 455522) They say: We came to jail because we wanted to disobey the laws of Government.
('50', 278, 8, 33, 455601) How do you ask us to obey the rules inside the jail?
('50', 278, 8, 34, 455654) We are pledged only to non violence but we will certainly defy the Government even in jails.

('50', 279, 5, 7, 456051) KANTA, I have your letter.
('50', 279, 5, 8, 456078) You can go as Premabehn did, after obtaining permission, If there is a reason you also may go with permission as Premabehn has done, so arranging the time that the work does not suffer when you have a reason or feel an irresistible wish to go.
('50', 279, 5, 9, 456322) You may tell Narandas.
('50', 279, 5, 10, 456345) You will not be able forcibly to restrain your mind.
('50', 279, 5, 11, 456398) Restraint should be exercised with understanding.
('50', 279, 5, 12, 456448) Brother should improve his health.
('50', 279, 5, 13, 456483) The cure rests in his own hands.
('50', 279, 5, 14, 456516) If one pays attention to the right amount of exercise, regularity in all work, hip baths and moderation in eating, the health does improve in a large measure.
('50', 279, 5, 15, 456675) There can be no question of giving the sewing machine to a person who does not know how to use it.
('50', 279, 5, 16, 456774) Of course if there is somebody to teach, it may be lent.
('50', 279, 5, 17, 456831) You cannot be expected to teach sewing since all your time belongs to the Ashram.
('50', 279, 5, 18, 456913) Gangabehn or Narandas may arrange for a teacher.
('50', 279, 5, 19, 456962) Have I answered all your questions ?

('50', 280, 2, 3, 457342) YERAVDA MANDIR, Night, November 30, 1930
('50', 280, 3, 4, 457383) PREMA, I was very happy to read your letter.
('50', 280, 3, 5, 457428) It is two days now since you broke your fast.
('50', 280, 3, 6, 457474) By the time you get this letter, you will have forgotten all about the fast and will be enjoying new youth.
('50', 280, 3, 7, 457582) If you do not have that experience, I would not regard the fast as a complete success.
('50', 280, 3, 8, 457669) I expect that you will describe the result of your fast in detail.
('50', 280, 3, 9, 457736) Your experience should be a guide to others.
('50', 280, 3, 10, 457781) You know, of course, how to return to normal diet gradually after the fast is over.
('50', 280, 3, 11, 457865) You will feel very hungry immediately after a fast, but you should certainly not eat as much as the stomach demands.
('50', 280, 3, 12, 457982) You should gradually increase the quantity of milk and curds, and eat nothing between the meals.
('50', 280, 3, 13, 458079) You may of course eat juicy fruits.
('50', 280, 3, 14, 458115) I hope you do not count expense in that regard.
('50', 280, 3, 15, 458163) Your body should become completely healthy.
('50', 280, 3, 16, 458207) I am not surprised to hear that you could work normally during the fast.
('50', 280, 3, 17, 458280) I have observed many people doing so.
('50', 280, 3, 18, 458318) And that is my own experience, too.
('50', 280, 3, 19, 458354) Those who have been harbouring many diseases in their bodies feel stronger during a fast.
('50', 280, 3, 20, 458444) At any rate there is a brighter light on their faces.
('50', 280, 3, 21, 458498) I am satisfied with the childrens account sent by you.
('50', 280, 3, 22, 458553) Krishnavijay seems to stand first in every item.
('50', 280, 3, 23, 458602) Is there no one who can take Dudhibehns classes in her absence?
('50', 280, 3, 24, 458666) I know that in the present circumstances you cannot ask anyone about this.
('50', 280, 3, 25, 458741) What can you do when so many women are outside the Ashram?
('50', 280, 3, 26, 458800) All the same, if there is any person to whom you can entrust the work, do not hesitate to ask him or her.
('50', 280, 3, 27, 458906) Dhurandhar must have been released.
('50', 280, 3, 28, 458942) Tell him that I remember the discussions I had with him.
('50', 280, 3, 29, 458999) I also remember his diary.
('50', 280, 3, 30, 459026) Ask him to write to me.
('50', 280, 3, 31, 459050) Let him describe his experience, too.
('50', 280, 3, 32, 459088) He should also write about his future plans.
('50', 280, 3, 33, 459133) Mathuri has a complaint against you, that you beat children.
('50', 280, 3, 34, 459194) Sometimes you even use a rod.
('50', 280, 3, 35, 459224) If this is true, give up the practice.
('50', 280, 3, 36, 459263) One should never beat children.
('50', 280, 3, 37, 459295) Crosby has written a book called Tolstoy as Teacher.
('50', 280, 3, 38, 459348) Probably it is in our collection.
('50', 280, 3, 39, 459382) Read it.
('50', 280, 3, 40, 459391) It has now been proved that physical punishment does not reform children.
('50', 281, 0, 1, 459465) 282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 281, 1, 2, 459507) Iknow that anyone who is accustomed to use the rod while teaching will find it difficult to give up the practice.
('50', 281, 1, 3, 459621) But that is also true of an armed soldier.
('50', 281, 1, 4, 459664) He thinks that without his gun he can get nothing done in this world.
('50', 281, 1, 5, 459734) Our Ashram exists to prove that we can do without a gun.
('50', 281, 1, 6, 459791) This is true in regard to children.
('50', 281, 1, 7, 459827) I will not write more than this just now.
('50', 281, 1, 8, 459869) If necessary, I will go into further argument after I get your reply.
('50', 281, 1, 9, 459939) I hope that you had plenty of sleep during the fast, and that now you regularly go to bed early.
('50', 281, 1, 10, 460036) One ought to have sufficient sleep.
('50', 281, 1, 11, 460072) Man needs sleep more than he does food.
('50', 281, 1, 12, 460112) Fasting in regard to food benefits one, but fasting in regard to sleep wastes away ones body.
('50', 281, 1, 13, 460206) It dulls the brain and makes one restless.
('50', 281, 1, 14, 460249) Do not, therefore, be careless about sleep.
('50', 281, 1, 15, 460293) I would not complain if you sleep soundly between 9 p.m.
('50', 281, 1, 16, 460350) and 4 a.m.
('50', 281, 1, 17, 460361) You will read about my experiment in the letter to Mira.

('50', 281, 6, 21, 460555) November 30, 1930
('50', 281, 7, 22, 460573) BHAI MOOLCHANDJI, Your letter to hand.
('50', 281, 7, 23, 460612) You must resolutely get up at 4 a.m.
('50', 281, 7, 24, 460649) It does not matter if you do not have any motions.
('50', 281, 7, 25, 460700) Cleanse your mouth and say the prayers; drink a bowlful of cold water after cleansing the mouth.
('50', 281, 7, 26, 460797) Go out for a walk after the prayers.
('50', 281, 7, 27, 460834) Walk briskly.
('50', 281, 7, 28, 460848) This will induce motions.
('50', 281, 7, 29, 460874) You will feel warm instead of cold.
('50', 281, 7, 30, 460910) Dont worry if your bowels do not move.
('50', 281, 7, 31, 460949) After the walk, you can occupy yourself in whatever task you choose.
('50', 281, 7, 32, 461018) Go to the lavatory when you feel the urge.
('50', 281, 7, 33, 461061) You will be cured by doing so for some days.

('50', 282, 2, 3, 461238) November 29/December 1, 1930
('50', 282, 3, 4, 461267) MIRA, This is time after the morning prayer 29 11 1930. It is fairly cold.
('50', 282, 3, 5, 461342) But I do a little writing after the prayer and before walking out on the bugle of 5.30. I am glad you were better when you wrote your letter.
('50', 282, 3, 6, 461484) We can only learn really in everything as in the matter of health keeping by making repeated mistakes and profiting by them.
('50', 282, 3, 7, 461609) This is an introduction to my confession rather than a warning to you.
('50', 282, 3, 8, 461680) Last Thursday I suddenly developed a bad stomachache.
('50', 282, 3, 9, 461734) I could have avoided it but stupidly did not.
('50', 282, 3, 10, 461780) As you know I have been lately living on curds.
('50', 282, 3, 11, 461828) They agreed very well though the bowels could be moved only by the enema.
('50', 282, 3, 12, 461902) But as you saw the weight was going up and I was otherwise fit.
('50', 282, 3, 13, 461966) So I continued the curds and then too the thick part.
('50', 282, 3, 14, 462020) That induced further constipation despite the enema.
('50', 282, 3, 15, 462073) That was sufficient warning to stop at least curds or better still all food for a day.
('50', 282, 3, 16, 462160) I would not and suffered for the day.
('50', 282, 3, 17, 462198) I voluntarily brought out what I had eaten and in a few hours the pain subsided.
('50', 282, 3, 18, 462279) Nothing but raisin water the next day and I was quite fit though at once I lost 3 lb.
('50', 282, 3, 19, 462365) in weight.
('50', 282, 3, 20, 462376) It is ever thus with me.
('50', 282, 3, 21, 462401) My weight beyond 95 is evidently an uncertain quantity probably made up of poisonous matter.
('50', 282, 3, 22, 462494) I determined too to get rid of the constipation if it was at all possible, so I have continued the stopping of curds.
('50', 282, 3, 23, 462612) (Here is the bugle and I stop for the time being).
('50', 282, 3, 24, 462663) To resume at 8 p.m.
('50', 282, 3, 25, 462683) And I am now taking cooked leaves and tomatoes and dates or raisins.
('50', 282, 3, 26, 462752) The bowels have moved naturally, strength has been maintained and the weight has suffered no further reduction.
('50', 282, 3, 27, 462864) Yesterday I added sweet potatoes and today 12 almonds.
('50', 282, 3, 28, 462919) No one need be alarmed at this change.
('50', 282, 3, 29, 462958) If I feel weak or lose weight steadily, I shall at once revert to milk and shall feel all the better for the milk fast.
('50', 282, 3, 30, 463078) If on the other hand the change agrees it will be a source of additional joy.
('50', 282, 3, 31, 463156) Therefore you should all rejoice over the change.
('50', 282, 3, 32, 463206) If it works, it is well.
('50', 282, 3, 33, 463231) It is well also if it does not.
('50', 282, 3, 34, 463263) I shall take no risks.
('50', 282, 3, 35, 463286) So Kaka left and he wept as he left.
('50', 282, 3, 36, 463323) We had come so close to each other.
('50', 282, 3, 37, 463359) Within two hours of his departure they sent mePyarelal and of course he has taken possession of me.
('50', 282, 3, 38, 463459) I put him on your wheel.
('50', 282, 3, 39, 463484) He spun 83 rounds.
('50', 282, 3, 40, 463503) It went practically as I had set it up.
('50', 282, 3, 41, 463543) We have now concocted some improvements on the holder.
('50', 282, 3, 42, 463598) He is at one such whilst I am writing this.
('50', 282, 3, 43, 463642) Somehow or other I can only think of
('50', 283, 0, 1, 463679) 284 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 283, 1, 2, 463721) the wheel and all it connotes.
('50', 283, 1, 3, 463752) The Gandiv too is undergoing considerable improvement.
('50', 283, 1, 4, 463807) I hope to try the improved wheel tomorrow.
('50', 283, 1, 5, 463850) I will have a movable wheel and will have a spring for tension.
('50', 283, 1, 6, 463914) If it works well, the output must increase.
('50', 283, 1, 7, 463958) I am gradually getting control over the takli.
('50', 283, 1, 8, 464005) My speed on your takli went up to 87 rounds per hour.
('50', 283, 1, 9, 464059) But Vinoba says I must first try the steel takli and he has sent me two and I am trying to work at it.
('50', 283, 1, 10, 464162) I havent yet got the result expected.
('50', 283, 1, 11, 464200) But I am daily gaining confidence and hope soon to be able to pull 100 rounds per hour on the takli.
('50', 283, 1, 12, 464301) (As it was 9 p.m.
('50', 283, 1, 13, 464319) I had to stop here.
('50', 283, 1, 14, 464339) I resume at 4.30 a.m.
('50', 283, 1, 15, 464361) after prayer Sunday.) I understand about the Kumarappa differences.
('50', 283, 1, 16, 464429) If Mahadev is gone Kaka has now come.
('50', 283, 1, 17, 464467) He may be of help in adjusting differences.
('50', 283, 1, 18, 464511) The golden rule is not to fret if things go contrary to ones wishes and to yield where resistance is useless or likely to be misunderstood, where there is no principle at stake and where in an organization responsibility is not solely ones own.
('50', 283, 1, 19, 464756) The virtue of charity comes into play only when one comes in contact with a variety of opinion and conduct.
('50', 283, 1, 20, 464864) Strict and even harsh with ourselves, charitable and even lax with regard to others.
('50', 283, 1, 21, 464949) In the end, we find that we are neither strict regarding ourselves nor lax regarding others.
('50', 283, 1, 22, 465042) The fact is we do not as readily observe our own blemishes as we are to detect those of others.
('50', 283, 1, 23, 465138) Hence the terrible truth Pluck the beam out of thine own eyes before you remove the mote from thy neighbours or Burnss (Is it not?) O that we could see ourselves as others see us. In practice I have found that it is best to search about ourselves and to assume the truth of friends criticism of ourselves and to take them in the first instance at their word when they disown guilt or defect.
('50', 283, 1, 24, 465530) But enough of this morning sermonizing.
('50', 283, 1, 25, 465570) You will act as the spirit guides you.

('50', 283, 3, 29, 465678) But it proved a failure.
('50', 283, 3, 30, 465703) I fitted up the other Gandiv and it worked splendidly without a hitch.
('50', 283, 3, 31, 465774) Through the favour of the Superintendent I have got theGandiv with my improvements incorporated.
('50', 283, 3, 32, 465871) It promises to work well.

('50', 284, 3, 4, 466116) KUSUM (DESAI), Though you had resolved to write every week, there has been no letter from you this week.
('50', 284, 3, 5, 466221) I look upon this as a serious lapse.
('50', 284, 3, 6, 466258) One may say that there is nothing as grave as violating a solemn resolution.
('50', 284, 3, 7, 466335) This is such a common weakness that we dont realize its gravity.
('50', 284, 3, 8, 466400) But you should know that it is a grave weakness indeed and guard yourself against it.
('50', 284, 3, 9, 466486) When you have nothing to write, you may sign on a blank sheet, as Chhotelal does.
('50', 284, 3, 10, 466568) But it is not likely that a child will have nothing to say to its father or mother.

('50', 284, 10, 18, 466950) You must have talked with Kakasaheb to your hearts content.
('50', 284, 10, 19, 467010) Take care and do not fall ill again.

('50', 285, 1, 2, 467284) 405. LETTER TO NARANDAS GANDHI
('50', 285, 2, 3, 467315) November 27/ December 3, 1930 Thursday morning
('50', 285, 3, 4, 467362) NARANDAS, This time your packet was handed over to me as soon as it came yesterday evening.
('50', 285, 3, 5, 467454) I have received the copies of Vratavichar.
('50', 285, 3, 6, 467497) If Chi.
('50', 285, 3, 7, 467505) Kusum is firm in her decision, I like it.
('50', 285, 3, 8, 467547) Since in any case she will not marry before swaraj is won, why should she bind herself just now?
('50', 285, 3, 9, 467644) The right thing would be to act upon her inclination at that time.
('50', 285, 3, 10, 467711) Convey this view of mine to both Devchandbhai and Jamnalalji.
('50', 285, 3, 11, 467773) Ascertain Kusums real wishes.
('50', 285, 3, 12, 467803) She should not advance this as an excuse if in the depth of her heart the real reason is different.
('50', 285, 3, 13, 467903) She is completely free to do what she wishes.
('50', 285, 3, 14, 467949) I would tell this same thing to the two young men too; if they are ready to wait till we get swaraj, why should they wish to bind themselves or bind any girl now?
('50', 285, 3, 15, 468112) A brave man or bhakta would not do that, and if Kusum is a brave girl and if she has decided to marry, she should marry a brave youth.
('50', 285, 3, 16, 468247) I will write to Ghanshyamdas.
('50', 285, 3, 17, 468277) Why does Manilal refuse to take milk?
('50', 285, 3, 18, 468315) If he keeps up his strength, however, I dont insist that he should take it.
('50', 285, 3, 19, 468391) Only, he should not be obstinate in refusing to take it.
('50', 285, 3, 20, 468448) If he is losing weight, he should take it.
('50', 285, 3, 21, 468491) Why doesnt Devdas write?
('50', 285, 4, 22, 468516) Friday morning
('50', 285, 5, 23, 468531) Ever since I had heard about Amidas, I was filled with admiration for him.
('50', 285, 5, 24, 468606) He has achieved perfect victory.
('50', 285, 5, 25, 468639) He was like one of the ancient sages in keeping his pledge.
('50', 285, 5, 26, 468699) I believe the Ashram to have been sanctified by his having stayed there.
('50', 285, 5, 27, 468772) Let all of us learn from Amidas how to die cheerfully for the sake of our pledge.
('50', 285, 5, 28, 468854) If he had been inspired by my example in taking the vow of refraining from milk, etc., he had acted hastily.
('50', 285, 5, 29, 468963) I think that no one should copy my example in this respect till I myself succeed in keeping such a vow.
('50', 285, 5, 30, 469067) It is, however, clear to me as daylight that, having taken the vow, Amidas could not break it.
('50', 285, 5, 31, 469162) A vow taken with open eyes, even if it means a risk to the body, ought not to be broken.
('50', 285, 5, 32, 469251) A vow which would do harm to the soul ought not to be taken and, if sucha vow has been taken, it is ones moral duty to break it.
('50', 285, 5, 33, 469380) For instance, no one can take
('50', 286, 0, 1, 469410) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 287
('50', 286, 1, 2, 469455) a vow that he will always speak untruth, for such a vow harms the soul.
('50', 286, 1, 3, 469527) A vow always to speak the truth may mean a risk to theto the body and may cost us our life, it may even seem to harm the interests of the country, but it must be kept.
('50', 286, 1, 4, 469695) I will write a letter to his father.
('50', 286, 1, 5, 469732) Read it and send it on to him.
('50', 286, 1, 6, 469763) Saturday morning
('50', 286, 2, 7, 469780) As regards Sorabjis insurance, inform him that it is beyond our means to pay the premiums.
('50', 286, 2, 8, 469871) He should manage somehow to pay them and should send the receipt.
('50', 286, 2, 9, 469937) Write to Jalbhai too about this.
('50', 286, 2, 10, 469970) Make a note of Budhabhais decision concerning Nanibehn and inform her about it, and go on recovering the money till the amount is paid up.
('50', 286, 2, 11, 470109) I was not satisfied by .
('50', 286, 2, 12, 470134) s 1 letter.
('50', 286, 2, 13, 470146) Read the reply which I have written to him.
('50', 286, 2, 14, 470190) So long as we entertain a suspicion about him, he cannot join the struggle.
('50', 286, 2, 15, 470266) Only those inmates of the Ashram who are pure in our eyes may Join it.
('50', 286, 2, 16, 470337) Take the utmost care about the [spinning] yajna.
('50', 286, 2, 17, 470386) Endeavour to remove the deficiencies in such work.
('50', 286, 2, 18, 470437) Everyone should learn to test the strength and count of yarn, and should actually do so every day.
('50', 286, 2, 19, 470536) A rough and ready method of testing the strength can be easily invented.
('50', 286, 2, 20, 470609) It should be invented and everyone should test the strength of his or her yarn with its help.
('50', 286, 2, 21, 470703) If the yarn spun by each is woven separately, we would know its strength better.
('50', 286, 2, 22, 470784) It was very good indeed that Sitala Sahay came.
('50', 286, 2, 23, 470832) But how did he escape the attention of the U.P. Government?
('50', 286, 2, 24, 470892) Show Shivabhais letter to Kakasaheb before you send it to me.
('50', 286, 2, 25, 470954) If the facts he mentions are such as can be given publicity, there is no objection to his writing to me about them.
('50', 286, 2, 26, 471070) On the contrary, there may be some advantage in informing me about them.
('50', 286, 2, 27, 471143) But leave the responsibility in this regard to Kakasaheb.
('50', 286, 2, 28, 471201) s 2 case is a moving one.
('50', 286, 2, 29, 471227) I cannot understand how .
('50', 286, 2, 30, 471253) 3 came to form such a connection.
('50', 286, 2, 31, 471287) I will write to him.
('50', 286, 2, 32, 471308) Read the letter and pass it on to him.
('50', 286, 2, 33, 471347) Sunday night
('50', 286, 3, 34, 471360) I have written the letter I mentioned above.
('50', 286, 3, 35, 471405) It has turned out to be a very important one.

('50', 287, 4, 10, 471913) BAPU 1 [PS.] The third, the fourth and the following fifth chapter should be read together, as they explain to us what the yoga of selfless action (anasakti) is and what are the means of practising it.
('50', 287, 4, 11, 472115) If these three chapters are properly understood, the reader will have less difficulty in tackling what follows.
('50', 287, 4, 12, 472227) The remaining chapters deal in detail with the ways and means of achieving anasakti.
('50', 287, 4, 13, 472312) We should study the Gita from this point of view, and if we pursue this study we shall find without much trouble a solution of the problems which confront us from day to day.
('50', 287, 4, 14, 472487) This calls for daily practice.
('50', 287, 4, 15, 472518) Let everybody try it.
('50', 287, 4, 16, 472540) If for instance he is angry, let him remember the verse dealing with anger and subdue that enemy.
('50', 287, 4, 17, 472638) Supposing we heartily dislike somebody, or are impatient or gluttonous or in doubt as to whether we should do or should not do something or other, all these difficulties can be solved with the help of mother Gita if we have faith in it and give it constant study.
('50', 287, 4, 18, 472902) Our daily recitation of the Gita as well as this series of letters is a means to this end.

('50', 288, 3, 4, 473290) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, I heard from Jamnalalji that a friend or a partner of yours had lost heavily in speculation.
('50', 288, 3, 5, 473402) The message also says that this has caused you sorrow.
('50', 288, 3, 6, 473457) Speculation itself implies loss.
('50', 288, 3, 7, 473490) Then why take it to heart?
('50', 288, 3, 8, 473517) A direct lesson drawn from this loss can even be a source of happiness.
('50', 288, 3, 9, 473589) Why dont you and your friends take a vow not to indulge in speculation any more?
('50', 288, 3, 10, 473670) Earnings from speculation can never be truly ethical.

('50', 288, 9, 18, 474001) What is the cause of this breakdown in health?
('50', 288, 9, 19, 474048) In any case you must give yourself complete rest.
('50', 288, 9, 20, 474098) You must relax both mind and body.
('50', 288, 9, 21, 474133) Therefore please go gently.

('50', 289, 2, 3, 474432) YERAVDA MANDIR, December 4, 1930
('50', 289, 3, 4, 474465) KASHINATH, I got both your letters.
('50', 289, 3, 5, 474501) I was glad to learn that your mother and others had arrived.
('50', 289, 3, 6, 474562) If you take your meals with your mother with Narandass consent, I should not object.
('50', 289, 3, 7, 474647) However, there is certainly a moral flaw in what you are doing.
('50', 289, 3, 8, 474711) You ought to make it clear to Mother that the life which you two live is different from normal family life.
('50', 289, 3, 9, 474819) Of course the financial aspect of the matter creates some difficulty.
('50', 289, 3, 10, 474889) But I have stated here only the ideal.
('50', 289, 3, 11, 474928) Do not take my words to mean that you ought to take your meals in the common kitchen, as we cannot always live up to an ideal and sometimes in actual practice we have to compromise it in order that we may not be forced to give it up altogether.
('50', 289, 3, 12, 475173) As for your relations with Father, strictness is necessary.
('50', 289, 3, 13, 475233) You should tell him in the plainest language that he should give up hopes of your taking up a job or a profession and earning money.
('50', 289, 3, 14, 475366) By telling him this, you will serve him, for, as long as there is the slightest hope, he will continue complaining to you, but will cease doing so or rather the complaining will cease of itself, when he has given up the hope.
('50', 289, 3, 15, 475592) This is human nature.
('50', 289, 3, 16, 475614) When hope is entirely gone, despair itself turns into a sort of consolation.
('50', 289, 3, 17, 475691) There are here several prisoners serving life sentences, who have no hope of being released and, therefore, live cheerfully.
('50', 289, 3, 18, 475816) Those whose position is uncertain, like mine, suffer.
('50', 289, 3, 19, 475870) They keep on hoping from day to day that they would soon be released.
('50', 289, 3, 20, 475940) In other words, the cause of the pain in your relationship with Father is in your own mind.
('50', 289, 3, 21, 476032) If you have understood your dharma clearly you should not so much as give a thought to Fathers complaining.
('50', 289, 3, 22, 476140) To borrow money from friends to help Father to pay his debts and relieve his burden to that extent is not a good policy.
('50', 289, 3, 23, 476261) It would be better not to receive such private benefits from ones friends.
('50', 289, 3, 24, 476336) Here again, I have merely stated the ideal.
('50', 289, 3, 25, 476380) It may be advisable, in case of necessity, to borrow money from Mahavir Prasad and others if your relationswith them are intimate.
('50', 289, 3, 26, 476511) Solve all these problems with the master key of non attachment.

('50', 290, 3, 5, 476756) It was a beautiful one.
('50', 290, 3, 6, 476780) Dhirus firmness is wonderful.
('50', 290, 3, 7, 476810) His inclination towards mischief reflects this firmness of his.
('50', 290, 3, 8, 476874) Let us hope that some of these Ashram children will excel us all in service when they grow up.
('50', 290, 3, 9, 476969) If we are pure in our hearts and become daily purer, that is bound to be so.
('50', 290, 3, 10, 477046) I am not surprised by your description of the conditions in Kathiawar.
('50', 290, 3, 11, 477117) That lethargy shows that we have still a long way to go.
('50', 290, 3, 12, 477174) Indeed such effort is the essence of our spiritual striving.

('50', 292, 3, 4, 478789) MY DEAR ANAND, Depression overtakes you because you think too much about things other than the task before you.
('50', 292, 3, 5, 478901) This is a sign of unfaithfulness; You will cease to worry about any other thing the moment you realizethat you are to devote yourself body, mind and soul to the duty undertaken by you.
('50', 292, 3, 6, 479086) Truth demands this.

('50', 292, 8, 11, 479270) Let the Government seize all the goods they wish and auction them for nothing.
('50', 292, 8, 12, 479349) The truth is that, under an oppressive Government, those who follow the path of right can own no property.
('50', 292, 8, 13, 479456) If any is left with them, they should know that the Government can seize it whenever it wishes to do so.

('50', 293, 9, 17, 480606) I have already written to you about what to eat.

('50', 293, 9, 19, 480731) You should take milk and curds and eat khakhra and boiled vegetables; if you can get fruits, like papaiya and mosambi, you will not require vegetables.
('50', 293, 9, 20, 480883) I, personally, see no need for medicines.

('50', 296, 9, 12, 484126) Your interpretation of the term abhyasa is correct, as also of chittavrittinirodha.
('50', 296, 9, 13, 484210) Dhyana=Upasana, i.e., ulti mately it could mean faithfully observing ones own dharma.
('50', 296, 9, 14, 484296) In my view here the word dhyana is used in a narrower sense.
('50', 296, 9, 15, 484357) Dhyana refers to our silent sittings at the time of our worship and prayers.
('50', 296, 9, 16, 484434) This brings about a [sense of] dedication to the Lord, which in its turn gives rise to a disinterested attitude.
('50', 296, 9, 17, 484547) No social service is possible without self purification, which again develops in the course of social service.

('50', 297, 3, 5, 485138) I was happy to learn about Kamalas self control.

('50', 297, 3, 7, 485310) If a person cannot fast by dropping even one meal, he or she should learn to do so by patient effort, especially one who wishes to observe brahmacharya.

('50', 297, 9, 18, 485963) What you say is true.
('50', 297, 9, 19, 485985) No one ought to give up his or her work for any reason whatever.
('50', 297, 9, 20, 486050) This is the ideal.
('50', 297, 9, 21, 486069) We should not feel unhappy if everybody cannot act up to it.
('50', 297, 9, 22, 486130) We should not criticize such a person even in our thoughts.
('50', 297, 9, 23, 486190) We should be strict in judging our own weaknesses, but generous in judging others.
('50', 297, 9, 24, 486273) This is not goodness but the correct principle to follow.
('50', 297, 9, 25, 486331) We have no knowledge of the struggle which the person whose weakness we observe may be making.
('50', 297, 9, 26, 486426) It is the effort which matters.
('50', 297, 9, 27, 486458) It may be that we are free from a particular weakness, but that may not be the result of any effort on our part.

('50', 298, 1, 3, 486724) But there may be great merit in the self denial of a person who was a habitual meateater but has given up eating it now, though he may repeatedly break his vow.
('50', 298, 1, 4, 486885) Hence the right thing is that we ourselves should do the best we can to follow a rule perfectly, and be satisfied with what others can do.

('50', 298, 7, 12, 487296) MATHURADAS, Hitherto I had been an admiring reader of your articles.
('50', 298, 7, 13, 487365) That admiration remains, but now there is added to it the viewpoint of a student and a critic.
('50', 298, 7, 14, 487460) I see that your book is not a self teacher on the subject.
('50', 298, 7, 15, 487519) By reading it one cannot learn carding.
('50', 298, 7, 16, 487559) Even those who know it a little would not be able to carry out the reforms you suggest.
('50', 298, 7, 17, 487647) The book is excellent in itself, but as a self teacher it seems to me incomplete.
('50', 298, 7, 18, 487729) As far as I have understood your book I think you have rejected the method you had explained to me and have followed a new one.
('50', 298, 7, 19, 487857) I thought I had already adopted it.
('50', 298, 7, 20, 487893) But on reading your book again, I find that I had done nothing new at all.
('50', 298, 7, 21, 487968) Now my suggestion is that you should send me a draft lesson as if you were teaching me the method.
('50', 298, 7, 22, 488067) It is not necessary to rewrite the whole of your book.
('50', 298, 7, 23, 488122) How much cotton should I hold out to the string at a time and in how many pulls should it get carded?
('50', 298, 7, 24, 488224) With how much cotton should I begin the carding?
('50', 298, 7, 25, 488273) Should the pad be arranged anew every day and why should it be of half carded cotton?
('50', 298, 7, 26, 488359) And should that in its turn be carded the same day?
('50', 298, 7, 27, 488411) Should all the cotton put on the mat in the beginning be carded the same day?
('50', 298, 7, 28, 488489) As we pull at the string, the bow also swings, doesnt it?
('50', 298, 7, 29, 488547) The left hand should be used only for raising and lowering the carding bow and it is moved forwards and backwards by the action of the rod; isnt that what you mean?

('50', 299, 7, 21, 489726) However, I would not take up much of his time for this, as he devotes all his time to spinning.
('50', 299, 7, 22, 489822) You should, therefore, point out mistakes in my spelling.
('50', 299, 7, 23, 489880) You should not, in your present state of health, spend much time for me.
('50', 299, 7, 24, 489953) As I have plenty of leisure, I will read your letters slowly and carefully.
('50', 299, 7, 25, 490029) Mother is partial to Father.
('50', 299, 7, 26, 490058) His handwriting is an old mans and yours that of a youngster.
('50', 299, 7, 27, 490120) But let that be.
('50', 299, 7, 28, 490137) Though a person may own a white beard, he may be young in mind and may play a thousand gamesteach French to someone, translate from other languages and revolve all manner of plans in his mind.
('50', 299, 7, 29, 490330) Others may be young in years, but old in mind.
('50', 299, 7, 30, 490377) Of course I would not say that you are quite that, but you will cease being so if your septum trouble is cured.
('50', 299, 7, 31, 490489) The news of that operation did not frighten me.
('50', 299, 7, 32, 490537) In fact, I am never frightened by an operation.

('50', 300, 7, 11, 490990) You have not been arrested so far, though of course it would be good if you were.
('50', 300, 7, 12, 491072) You should remain unconcerned whether or not you are arrested.
('50', 300, 7, 13, 491135) Go on patiently doing all your work.

('50', 300, 13, 21, 491427) By not attending prayers in order that they might help in putting out the fire, the women offered real prayers.
('50', 300, 13, 22, 491539) This is an example of non action in action.
('50', 300, 13, 23, 491583) You fulfilled the real purpose of prayers.
('50', 300, 13, 24, 491626) Moreover, one can go on repeating Ramanama to oneself even while running to the place where fire has started in order to help put it out.
('50', 300, 13, 25, 491764) Finally, the person whose life is dedicated to service and who has burnt his or her egotism lives his life in the spirit of prayer.

('50', 301, 1, 4, 492153) Pour out amrita against the poison which you describe.

('50', 301, 7, 14, 492676) Another was a lawyer.
('50', 301, 7, 15, 492698) I had become fairly intimate with the former.

('50', 303, 9, 19, 494925) Prayashchitta has no reference to cleanliness or lack of it.
('50', 303, 9, 20, 494986) It is enjoined for eating food served by a person belonging to a community other than ones own.
('50', 303, 9, 21, 495082) One who does not believe in this restriction should never perform prayashchitta on that account.

('50', 304, 1, 2, 495638) constipation is disturbing.
('50', 304, 1, 3, 495666) I hope when this reaches you all the effect of the attack would have worn out.
('50', 304, 1, 4, 495745) I have got rid of mine by simply dropping proteid food for a while.
('50', 304, 1, 5, 495813) I am now taking proteid through almonds.
('50', 304, 1, 6, 495854) I should love not to go back to milk.
('50', 304, 1, 7, 495892) Save now for a visible weakness, the result has been excellent.
('50', 304, 1, 8, 495956) Almonds I am taking very cautiously and I cannot sustain the strength on green vegetables merely and about an ounce of almonds.
('50', 304, 1, 9, 496084) I have gone to the ounce only for the last two days.
('50', 304, 1, 10, 496137) I must take a cereal.
('50', 304, 1, 11, 496159) I have not decided what to take.
('50', 304, 1, 12, 496192) I want to try bajri or juwariwhatever the jail chapati for the day.
('50', 304, 1, 13, 496260) If it agrees, the problem may be solved to my entire satisfaction.
('50', 304, 1, 14, 496327) But there will be no haste, certainly no obstinacy.
('50', 304, 1, 15, 496379) Immediately I feel the need, I shall go back to milk.
('50', 304, 1, 16, 496433) In another ten days I shall have finished the translation of the Bhajanavali.
('50', 304, 1, 17, 496511) It has given me such a joy.
('50', 304, 1, 18, 496539) I am not satisfied with the performance.
('50', 304, 1, 19, 496580) Save for the fact that it is an act of love, it has no othermeritcertainly no literary merit.
('50', 304, 1, 20, 496674) But it will help you to know the meaning of the bhajans and that was all I aimed at.
('50', 304, 1, 21, 496759) And when this is finished I hope to begin the other, viz., translation of preface to the Gujarati Gita.
('50', 304, 1, 22, 496863) I do not think I shall translate the verses, but I shall go through one of the existing translations and where it is different from mine, I shall note it and translate all the marginal notes.
('50', 304, 1, 23, 497055) This will simplify my work and save a great deal of labour.
('50', 304, 1, 24, 497115) Please share this with Kaka.
('50', 304, 1, 25, 497144) He will feel interested in the proposal.
('50', 304, 1, 26, 497185) The improvements in the Gandiv have exceeded all expectations.
('50', 304, 1, 27, 497248) It now runs smoothly.
('50', 304, 1, 28, 497270) It has the tension which was absent.
('50', 304, 1, 29, 497307) But I am not going to weary you with a description of the improvements.
('50', 304, 1, 30, 497379) I am describing them in a letter to Keshu.
('50', 304, 1, 31, 497422) I am sure that for speed it cannot now be excelled by any other wheel.
('50', 304, 1, 32, 497493) But that has still to be tested.
('50', 304, 1, 33, 497526) My assurance wont create more yarn, I know.
('50', 304, 1, 34, 497570) You must give yourself ample rest and must not work under tension.

('50', 305, 2, 3, 497826) Thursday morning, December 4/9, 1930
('50', 305, 3, 4, 497863) NARANDAS, I got your letter yesterday evening.
('50', 305, 3, 5, 497910) They pass on the packets to me and post them to you with great care.
('50', 305, 3, 6, 497979) It seems that the packets are delayed in posting by a day.
('50', 305, 3, 7, 498038) The doctor wishes to come during Diwali.
('50', 305, 3, 8, 498079) Does that mean after nine months?
('50', 305, 3, 9, 498113) Or does he mean the Christian Diwali?
('50', 305, 3, 10, 498151) If he means the Hindu Diwali, a great many things will have happened by then.
('50', 305, 3, 11, 498229) Mahalakshmi and Madhavji are very conscious of the deep significance of a pledge.
('50', 305, 3, 12, 498311) Hence both of them should be pained by a violation of even the letter of a pledge.
('50', 305, 3, 13, 498394) But we should be satisfied if everyone keeps a pledge as he or she understands it and to the best of his or her ability, and it seems that most people do so.
('50', 305, 3, 14, 498552) You should keep them vigilant.
('50', 305, 3, 15, 498583) Do what you think best about Giriraj.
('50', 305, 3, 16, 498621) Since you will have to bear the burden, I will accept your decision as the only proper one.
('50', 305, 3, 17, 498713) I know that Krishna will always have his own way.
('50', 305, 3, 18, 498763) If he keeps good health, I think he is likely to do great service in future.
('50', 305, 3, 19, 498840) I believe the same about Purushottam.
('50', 305, 3, 20, 498878) Let him write to me from time to time.
('50', 305, 3, 21, 498917) Pyarelal is improving quite well in health.
('50', 305, 3, 22, 498961) I hope it will not go down while he is with me.
('50', 305, 3, 23, 499009) His being with me is like a goat being near a wolf.
('50', 305, 3, 24, 499061) A goat tied in front of a wolf will grow thinner every day even if you feed it on the finest grass.
('50', 305, 3, 25, 499161) Something of that sort used to happen to Pyarelal.
('50', 305, 3, 26, 499212) I hope that is not so now.
('50', 305, 3, 27, 499239) I blame myself a good deal for what used to be.
('50', 305, 3, 28, 499287) Let us see what God wills.
('50', 305, 3, 29, 499314) He will get what he wants by way of food.
('50', 305, 3, 30, 499356) At present, he takes milk and curds and eats bread, vegetables and papaiya.
('50', 305, 3, 31, 499432) I had not imagined that Parnerkar would mismanage things as badly as he has done.
('50', 305, 3, 32, 499514) He is a worker with pure motives, but it seems that he cannot cope with work.
('50', 305, 3, 33, 499592) You did very well in being strict with him and getting the accounts in order.
('50', 305, 3, 34, 499670) I hope he will take rest now and improve his health.
('50', 305, 3, 35, 499723) Should we assume that the business at Bidaj is running at a loss?
('50', 305, 3, 36, 499789) If you think it necessary to reduce the scale or wind up any of our activities, do so.
('50', 305, 3, 37, 499876) Anyone who works in the spirit of

('50', 306, 1, 2, 499955) non attachment soon discovers the measure of his ability.
('50', 306, 1, 3, 500013) He will never be too eager to do things and never undertake anything beyond his capacity.
('50', 306, 1, 4, 500103) Really speaking, he does not have to seek work.
('50', 306, 1, 5, 500151) Work comes to him unsought, and he does his best to do full justice to it.
('50', 306, 1, 6, 500226) To the world he seems a man who has no work, for his face betrays no anxiety and he never complains about the burden of work.
('50', 306, 1, 7, 500352) In fact he carries no burden.
('50', 306, 1, 8, 500382) He entrusts his burdens to Lord Krishna and dances as He wills.
('50', 306, 1, 9, 500446) Jethalal had written to me saying that he would send a report of the work done.
('50', 306, 1, 10, 500526) I have not received the report.
('50', 306, 1, 11, 500558) I understand what you say about Kamalabehn Lundi.
('50', 306, 1, 12, 500608) That is what marriage is.
('50', 306, 1, 13, 500634) The desire for it has its source in lust and attachment.
('50', 306, 1, 14, 500691) Marriage is called a sacrament because it is a means of controlling lust.
('50', 306, 1, 15, 500765) That is how it was conceived, at any rate.
('50', 306, 1, 16, 500808) But this intention is now forgotten, and so for most people marriage has become a means of self indulgence.
('50', 306, 1, 17, 500916) I will write to Gangabehn and Nanibehn.
('50', 306, 1, 18, 500956) I have been watching your experiment in diet.
('50', 306, 1, 19, 501002) Give me detailed information from time to time.
('50', 306, 1, 20, 501050) It will certainly benefit you if you eat only a small quantity of groundnuts.
('50', 306, 1, 21, 501128) You may not even need them when you have milk and curds.
('50', 306, 1, 22, 501185) There is certainly some truth in the advice which research workers now give against eating many articles at a time.
('50', 306, 1, 23, 501301) All the foods are not simultaneously digested in the same manner and to the same degree and, therefore, a mixture of too many of them disturbs the stomach.
('50', 306, 1, 24, 501457) The description of compassion was very good indeed.
('50', 306, 1, 25, 501509) You say that you have sent the printed copies of the discourses; that may also mean that they are being dispatched now.
('50', 306, 1, 26, 501629) I have not received them.
('50', 306, 1, 27, 501655) Friday morning
('50', 306, 2, 28, 501670) I have given all details about my health and my diet in the letter to Kakasaheb, and so I do not repeat them here.
('50', 306, 2, 29, 501785) I had assumed that you would send for Keshu and hear his complaint, and that was why I did not write about it in my letter.
('50', 306, 2, 30, 501909) But I give a summary now as far as I remember what it was.
('50', 306, 2, 31, 501968) 1. You get angry with him without any reason.
('50', 306, 2, 32, 502014) 2. Once he tried to explain matters to you, but you did not listen to him and shouted at him so loudly that all could hear you and you said many improper things.
('50', 306, 2, 33, 502176) 3. You are very partial to Kusum, Navin and Dhiru and do not even listen to any complaints against them.
('50', 307, 0, 1, 502281) 308 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 307, 1, 2, 502323) 4. You have taken away from him the management of the factory without any reason.
('50', 307, 1, 3, 502405) 5. Damodardas left the Ashram out of disgust at your partiality.
('50', 307, 1, 4, 502470) I have written to Keshu and told him that just as I used to be under Maganlals spell and saw no faults in him, so am I under yours and see no fault in you, and will not, therefore, be ready to believe anything about you which I have not myself observed.
('50', 307, 1, 5, 502724) I, however, advised him to open his heart to you and tell you everything.
('50', 307, 1, 6, 502798) He merely said in reply that he was not satisfied by my letter.
('50', 307, 1, 7, 502862) After that I have kept quiet since he was to have a talk with Mahadev.
('50', 307, 1, 8, 502933) Now you should, yourself, call him and show to him his complaints which I have described.
('50', 307, 1, 9, 503023) If I have misunderstood him, he will correct my mistake.
('50', 307, 1, 10, 503080) If I have left out anything, he should add that.
('50', 307, 1, 11, 503129) You may then try to satisfy him if you can.
('50', 307, 1, 12, 503173) I have written to him and advised him to take up some work, no matter what it is.
('50', 307, 1, 13, 503255) I have told Kakasaheb about him.
('50', 307, 1, 14, 503288) I have advised him, too, that he should see Kakasaheb.
('50', 307, 1, 15, 503343) I have no doubt that it will do him no good whatever to remain without work.
('50', 307, 1, 16, 503420) If Harilal Desai wants to take up service in the Ashram and if you think there will be no harm in giving him a job do give him one.
('50', 307, 1, 17, 503552) He is unmethodical in work but he is a young man of transparent sincerity of purpose.
('50', 307, 1, 18, 503638) I think it will be worth while having him as one of our workers.
('50', 307, 1, 19, 503703) Did you read the long letter which .
('50', 307, 1, 20, 503740) 1 wrote to me?
('50', 307, 1, 21, 503755) He will produce no effect on me unless he tells me something concrete observed by himself.
('50', 307, 1, 22, 503846) I believe .
('50', 307, 1, 23, 503858) 2 to be a pure hearted girl.
('50', 307, 1, 24, 503887) 3 has also produced on me the impression of being pure in heart and one who would speak the truth.
('50', 307, 1, 25, 503986) I had a happy experience of him also during the march.
('50', 307, 1, 26, 504041) He had spread the fragrance of his character in the Kashi Vidyapith too.
('50', 307, 1, 27, 504114) It is true that he has been guiding .
('50', 307, 1, 28, 504152) 4 and trying to raise her level, but I have seen in him nothing but the attitude of a brother and teacher.
('50', 307, 1, 29, 504259) Silence Day afternoon Try to find soon a piece of leather to repair the soles of the sandals.
('50', 307, 1, 30, 504353) I find that the soles of the new pair, too, are none too strong.

('50', 308, 1, 3, 504682) Hence I say nothing here.
('50', 308, 1, 4, 504708) These days I seem to be able to observe small things with greater attention, and so I cannot help noticing the character of the handwriting in the different letters received in the packets sent by you.
('50', 308, 1, 5, 504910) I am trying to improve my bad handwriting.
('50', 308, 1, 6, 504953) You must have observed this in every letter of mine.
('50', 308, 1, 7, 505006) Bad handwriting is of course a form of discourtesy.
('50', 308, 1, 8, 505058) Discourtesy in every form is violence, but bad handwriting is direct violence too.
('50', 308, 1, 9, 505141) Anything which causes unnecessary pain to our neighbour or to any living creature is nothing but violence.
('50', 308, 1, 10, 505248) I have twice as much experience as others of what pain and inconvenience are caused to the reader by bad handwriting.
('50', 308, 1, 11, 505366) I have, in the first place, the experience of having to read letters written in bad writing by others and also the experience of the pain caused to others by my handwriting.
('50', 308, 1, 12, 505540) My aim in saying this is to advise all inmates of the Ashram, men and women, boys and girls, to take great care to write a good hand.
('50', 308, 1, 13, 505674) This requires no time but only some thought.
('50', 308, 1, 14, 505719) One must have love for the other party.
('50', 308, 1, 15, 505759) Let all of them observe the following rules: 1. They should leave enough space between the words.
('50', 308, 1, 16, 505857) 2. They should avoid flourishes in the letters.
('50', 308, 1, 17, 505905) 3. They should never leave a letter half written.
('50', 308, 1, 18, 505955) 4. They should not let the letters flow into one another.
('50', 308, 1, 19, 506013) 5. As far as possible, they should write to no one in pencil.
('50', 308, 1, 20, 506075) If they follow these rules, they will certainly be able to make their handwriting legible.
('50', 308, 1, 21, 506166) Haste signifies attachment.
('50', 308, 1, 22, 506194) Let no one write in haste.
('50', 308, 1, 23, 506221) Everyone should be content with what he or she can write slowly and patiently.

('50', 309, 9, 13, 507144) May she prosper in the right sense!!
('50', 309, 9, 14, 507181) This correspondence need not cease.
('50', 309, 9, 15, 507217) I would gladly continue it if you will further cross question me.
('50', 309, 9, 16, 507283) Many things I have noticed become clear through sheer lapse of time and consequent, unconscious observation.

('50', 310, 3, 4, 507518) MY DEAR ANAND, I have left not one single letter of yours unanswered.
('50', 310, 3, 5, 507588) I hardly think they have been intercepted.
('50', 310, 3, 6, 507631) I have answered all your questions.
('50', 310, 3, 7, 507667) I do hope you will get them all.
('50', 310, 3, 8, 507700) For avoiding constipation try green leafy vegetables and tomatoes only without any protein food for two or three days.
('50', 310, 3, 9, 507819) This plan has worked well with me.
('50', 310, 3, 10, 507854) Alternatively try stewed French plums without anything else.
('50', 310, 3, 11, 507915) Love to you both.

('50', 310, 8, 17, 508108) KUSUM (SENIOR) , I got your letter.
('50', 310, 8, 18, 508144) I observe no harmful effect on my health.
('50', 310, 8, 19, 508186) I see that the changes have done me nothing but good.
('50', 310, 8, 20, 508240) Do not worry on my account at all.
('50', 310, 8, 21, 508275) Pyarelals time is taken up as under: 375 rounds on the spinning wheel, 100 rounds on the takli and making the required number of slivers.
('50', 310, 8, 22, 508413) This work leaves him very little free time.
('50', 310, 8, 23, 508457) The takli takes up two hours of his time.
('50', 310, 8, 24, 508499) I, too, do almost the same work.
('50', 310, 8, 25, 508532) I spin 100 rounds on the takli, but am satisfied with 275 on the wheel.
('50', 310, 8, 26, 508604) The total comes to 375. What you say about the girls is correct.

('50', 311, 2, 3, 508830) December 11, 1930
('50', 311, 3, 4, 508848) JAYAPRAKASH, I have your beautiful letter.
('50', 311, 3, 5, 508891) What you have thought about Father is only right.
('50', 311, 3, 6, 508941) I shall say nothing more about it.
('50', 311, 3, 7, 508976) I hope you were successful with Ghanshyamdas.
('50', 311, 3, 8, 509022) As regards the motherland being considered as your mother there is a flaw in your thought.
('50', 311, 3, 9, 509113) Just as loving ones mother does not mean that one should not love anothers mother, so also loving ones motherland does not mean hating other countries.
('50', 311, 3, 10, 509265) Where there is no love for the motherland love of the world is an illusion.
('50', 311, 3, 11, 509341) And since the motherland has a greater right over us, being proud of the motherland without any ill will for other countries is only proper.
('50', 311, 3, 12, 509482) I cannot directly care for the children of the whole world.
('50', 311, 3, 13, 509542) But if I care lovingly for the children who are in my keeping I shall to that extent be doing service to the children of the world.
('50', 311, 3, 14, 509674) The case of the motherland is exactly similar.
('50', 311, 3, 15, 509721) After all it does matter in which land and in which atmosphere we are born.
('50', 311, 3, 16, 509797) Ahimsa has its origin in this thought.
('50', 311, 3, 17, 509836) In so far as ahimsa means universal love it can have direct application in our serving the creatures who are nearest us.
('50', 311, 3, 18, 509957) I hope you will now take Prabhavati to the Ashram.

('50', 311, 9, 24, 510170) PRABHUDAS, If one does not like a particular name, he should himself suggest a better one.
('50', 311, 9, 25, 510261) If Dhiru suggests a better one, we will keep it.
('50', 311, 9, 26, 510310) As far as I am concerned, I like the name Magan for your spinning wheel.
('50', 311, 9, 27, 510383) The three reasons given by you are even more appropriate.
('50', 311, 9, 28, 510441) Do not at all think about how long you will have to stay in Almora.
('50', 311, 9, 29, 510509) You know of my desire of setting up an ashram there.

('50', 312, 1, 2, 510679) who runs an ashram is not different from others.
('50', 312, 1, 3, 510728) Any place where the rules of an ashram are followed, is like an ashram.
('50', 312, 1, 4, 510800) You are a society of eight persons.
('50', 312, 1, 5, 510836) You have with you there the Gita, the Ramayana and the spinning wheel.
('50', 312, 1, 6, 510907) What more do you want?
('50', 312, 1, 7, 510930) For running the ashram, it is necessary to have some persons.
('50', 312, 1, 8, 510992) Just take it that you three are the ones sent there for the purpose.
('50', 312, 1, 9, 511061) Devotion of Tulsidas was the devotion of the future generation.
('50', 312, 1, 10, 511125) Rama in a human form did not exist in Tulsidass time.
('50', 312, 1, 11, 511179) His utterances are imaginary .
('50', 312, 1, 12, 511210) 1 even if Rama in a human form did exist in his time, his origin as God in human form took place in a later period.
('50', 312, 1, 13, 511326) Compare the seventh chapter of the Gita, to the grief of Rama.
('50', 312, 1, 14, 511389) I am the Creator of all the three qualities. Wherever we find deceit and fault in God, we need not accept Tulsidass saying that God has no faults and that we should not do as He does.
('50', 312, 1, 15, 511573) We have to observe the rules of proper conduct.
('50', 312, 1, 16, 511621) We cannot abide by the text of the inimitable book of Tulsidas, but have to abide by its inner meaning.
('50', 312, 1, 17, 511725) What does not appeal to us should be set aside.
('50', 312, 1, 18, 511773) One experiences the minds quality of forgetfulness every minute.

('50', 312, 6, 27, 512096) Eating, drinking, [spinning] yajna are all karma or actions.
('50', 312, 6, 28, 512157) An action that does not deserve to be undertaken is vikarma or perverse action.
('50', 312, 6, 29, 512237) Akarma is absence of action, i.e., action undertaken by man without attachment or desire for the fruit.
('50', 312, 6, 30, 512341) A perverse action cannot be undertaken without attachment.
('50', 312, 6, 31, 512400) Do write if you have any doubts.

('50', 313, 3, 5, 512661) was duly received.
('50', 313, 3, 6, 512680) The absence of any further news from you, I take to mean perfect restoration.
('50', 313, 3, 7, 512758) After each illness you are soon well, because the treatment followed is natural, but every sickness leaves behind it a legacy of weakness unless the system is allowed full rest and the mind relieved of tension.
('50', 313, 3, 8, 512969) I suppose the mental control is the most difficult.
('50', 313, 3, 9, 513021) For this the sovereign remedy is the application of the Gita.
('50', 313, 3, 10, 513083) Each time mind suffers a shock, there is failure in application.
('50', 313, 3, 11, 513148) Let good news as well as bad pass over you like water over a ducks back.
('50', 313, 3, 12, 513221) When we hear any, our duty is merely to find out whether any action is necessary and if it is, to do it as an instrument in the hands of Nature without being affected by or attached to the result.
('50', 313, 3, 13, 513418) This detachment appears a scientific necessity when we remember that in bringing about a result more than one instrument is employed.
('50', 313, 3, 14, 513552) Who shall dare say I have done it[?] I know you know all this.
('50', 313, 3, 15, 513615) Nevertheless, I drive the truth home, so that from the brain it may percolate to the heart.
('50', 313, 3, 16, 513707) So long as it remains in the brain only, it is a dead weight on it.
('50', 313, 3, 17, 513775) Any truth received by the brain must immediately be sent down to the heart.
('50', 313, 3, 18, 513851) When it is not, it suffers abortion and then it lies on the brain as so much poisonous matter.
('50', 313, 3, 19, 513946) What poisons the brain poisons the whole system.
('50', 313, 3, 20, 513995) Hence the necessity of using the brain as it should be merely as a transmitting station.
('50', 313, 3, 21, 514084) Whatever is there received is either transmitted to the heart for immediate action or it is rejected there and then as being unfit for transmission.
('50', 313, 3, 22, 514233) Failure of the brain to perform this function properly is the cause of almost all the ills that flesh is heir to as also for mental exhaustion.
('50', 313, 3, 23, 514377) If the brain simply performed its function, there need never be any brain fag.
('50', 313, 3, 24, 514456) So whenever we suffer from illness generally there is not only a dietetic error but there is also failure on the part of the brain to function properly.
('50', 313, 3, 25, 514609) The author of the Gita evidently saw this and gave the world the sovereign remedy in the clearest possible language.
('50', 313, 3, 26, 514726) Whenever therefore anything preys upon your mind, you should meditate on the central teaching of the Gita and throw off the burden.
('50', 313, 3, 27, 514858) Let us hope there never will be a recurrence of the terrible constipation.
('50', 314, 0, 1, 514933) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 315
('50', 314, 1, 2, 514978) As to Kumarappa if you have enough charity and goodwill forward to him all the criticism you receive leaving the result to take care of itself.
('50', 314, 1, 3, 515122) It is a duty you owe to him to let him have the criticisms.
('50', 314, 1, 4, 515182) You may now use Kaka too for the purpose of sending your messages.
('50', 314, 1, 5, 515249) For me the milkless experiment continues as yet without any bad result.
('50', 314, 1, 6, 515321) The weight has suffered a further decrease of 3 Ib.
('50', 314, 1, 7, 515373) but the vitality remains.
('50', 314, 1, 8, 515399) One cause of the decrease in weight is that I am most cautious about increasing the quantity of cereals and almonds I take.
('50', 314, 1, 9, 515523) Almonds remain at 3 tolas and bajri and juwari bhakhari a quarter, i.e., about 2 tolas each time, i.e., at 11 and 5. I may soon increase the weight.
('50', 314, 1, 10, 515672) Anyway the condition of the bowels is extraordinarily good.
('50', 314, 1, 11, 515732) I quite agree with you that the enema as a habit is a bad thing and should be got rid of, if at all possible.
('50', 314, 1, 12, 515842) It has been possible with the dropping of milk as it had become when, on going to Wardha, you will recall, I had dropped milk.
('50', 314, 1, 13, 515969) Indeed but for my folly in hastily following Gopalrao I might still have been flourishing on the diet I had then adopted.
('50', 314, 1, 14, 516091) The present diet is a slight modification of the Wardha one.
('50', 314, 1, 15, 516152) Whenever you are ill, you will not hesitate to write to me at once without waiting for the weekly letter day.

('50', 314, 6, 19, 516359) VASUMATI, I got all your letters together.
('50', 314, 6, 20, 516402) It is good that the women have been arrested.
('50', 314, 6, 21, 516448) I give all the news about myself in the common letter and, therefore, say nothing in letters to individual persons.
('50', 314, 6, 22, 516564) My health is all right.
('50', 314, 6, 23, 516588) I have given up milk at present and eat a rotla of jowar or bajra, vegetables and three tolas of almonds.
('50', 314, 6, 24, 516694) And in addition, lemons of course, and sometimes dates.
('50', 314, 6, 25, 516750) This diet has helped me to get rid of the need for enemas.
('50', 314, 6, 26, 516809) But I must wait and see whether I can keep it up.
('50', 314, 6, 27, 516859) The weight has gone down, but I do not worry about that at all.

('50', 315, 15, 25, 517862) You are constantly harassed by asthma.
('50', 315, 15, 26, 517901) Why dont you drive it out?
('50', 315, 15, 27, 517928) There must be something wrong with your diet or you may be getting excited.

('50', 316, 2, 3, 518300) December 14, 1930
('50', 316, 3, 4, 518318) PREMA, I have your letter.
('50', 316, 3, 5, 518345) I understand what you say about punishing children.
('50', 316, 3, 6, 518397) Your argument is an old one.
('50', 316, 3, 7, 518426) It is a vicious circle.
('50', 316, 3, 8, 518450) Punishment did you good and so you think you should punish the children.
('50', 316, 3, 9, 518523) When the children grow up, they will do the same.
('50', 316, 3, 10, 518573) This is exactly the argument by which people justify their faith in violence.
('50', 316, 3, 11, 518651) It is our aim to rise above this misleading experience.
('50', 316, 3, 12, 518707) I admit that that requires patience.
('50', 316, 3, 13, 518744) We have come together in the Ashram to cultivate that patience.
('50', 316, 3, 14, 518808) Our aim is not just to impart education to children or teach them discipline, but to build character in them.
('50', 316, 3, 15, 518918) Education, discipline, etc., are means to that end.
('50', 316, 3, 16, 518970) If the result of building character in them is that education and discipline .are neglected, let that be so.
('50', 316, 3, 17, 519079) I understand your argument, though.
('50', 316, 3, 18, 519115) I also see that there is no ill will behind your use of the rod.
('50', 316, 3, 19, 519180) But there are certainly anger and impatience behind them.
('50', 316, 3, 20, 519238) May I make a suggestion?
('50', 316, 3, 21, 519263) Call a meeting of the children.
('50', 316, 3, 22, 519295) If any of them say, You may punish us, and in this manner, if we play mischief or disobey you, you may punish them in the manner which they suggest.
('50', 316, 3, 23, 519444) You should not punish those who do not want youto punish them.
('50', 316, 3, 24, 519507) If you try this method, you will see that you do not need to punish them.
('50', 316, 3, 25, 519581) You should keep up this discussion.
('50', 316, 3, 26, 519617) Do not give up arguing out of impatience or despair.
('50', 316, 3, 27, 519670) Till your reason is convinced of what I say, you should follow your own path.
('50', 316, 3, 28, 519748) I know that you are dedicated to truth and, therefore, I am sure that you will realize the truth ultimately.
('50', 316, 3, 29, 519857) Your diet seems to be all right.
('50', 316, 3, 30, 519890) You did not describe your visit to Rajkot.

('50', 319, 3, 5, 522323) I have already replied to Kalavati.
('50', 319, 3, 6, 522359) The treatment being given to Mother seems to be all right.
('50', 319, 3, 7, 522418) There is no doubt that constipation is the root cause of many diseases.
('50', 319, 3, 8, 522490) I will describe for your information the experiment I am making at present, which has succeeded in curing my constipation at least.
('50', 319, 3, 9, 522622) For two or three days I took boiled leafy vegetables, together with which I had also boiled unripe tomatoes.
('50', 319, 3, 10, 522731) That by itself cured the constipation.
('50', 319, 3, 11, 522770) Then I started adding crushed almonds, gradually increasing the quantity to three tolas and now I have been taking a few bhakharis made of jowar and bajra flour.
('50', 319, 3, 12, 522932) This seems to keep up my strength.
('50', 319, 3, 13, 522967) Of course I can say nothing definitely.
('50', 319, 3, 14, 523007) I can do that if I can go on like this for two or three months.
('50', 319, 3, 15, 523071) Anyone who wishes to follow my example should do so with great care.
('50', 319, 3, 16, 523140) Both Santok and Radha know about the two types of bath described in Kuhnes book.

('50', 319, 3, 21, 523399) How do I deserve any blessing for the low prices of grain?
('50', 319, 3, 22, 523458) Wouldnt the cultivators, for their part, curse me?
('50', 319, 3, 23, 523509) There are several reasons for the prevailing low prices.
('50', 319, 3, 24, 523566) As far as I am concerned, I see no objection to making extracts from my letters provided they are taken with Narandass consent.
('50', 319, 3, 25, 523694) Pyarelal is happy and cheerful.

('50', 320, 3, 5, 524113) That 1,000 copies of the Bengali edition of Anasaktiyoga have been sold augurs well.
('50', 320, 3, 6, 524198) In winter mornings it is good to expose as much of the body as possible to the sun rays between 9 and 10. It is also beneficial to take some raw onion with roti by way of medicine during winter.
('50', 320, 3, 7, 524393) Onion has many qualities, though some drawbacks too.
('50', 320, 3, 8, 524446) The main drawback is that of smell, but that can be avoided by taking a small quantity.

('50', 321, 9, 20, 525940) Your fainting fits must stop, and I think they will in the Ashram.
('50', 321, 9, 21, 526007) If you require fruit, etc., dont hesitate to ask for it.
('50', 321, 9, 22, 526064) And dont plunge into work immediately.
('50', 321, 9, 23, 526103) You have done enough work in the Ashram in the past, and hence you should take complete rest now.

('50', 322, 6, 8, 527225) I worship Him whom the Vedas describe as neti neti (not this, not this).
('50', 322, 6, 9, 527298) Him they, the sages, have called God of gods, the unborn, the unfallen, the source of all.

('50', 322, 8, 11, 527398) 1 Ashram Bhajanavali is a collection of devotional songs which formed part of the morning and evening prayers at Gandhijis ashrams.
('50', 322, 8, 12, 527530) They were in various languages and taken from various sources, some of them obscure, but all fairly popular in Hindu religious tradition.
('50', 322, 8, 13, 527668) Gandhiji rendered these into English for Mirabehns benefit, in the first place, during his imprisonment in Yeravda Central Prison.
('50', 322, 8, 14, 527799) The work of translation was begun on May 6, 1930 and the last hymn was translated on December 15. In 1934 George Allen & Unwin Ltd.
('50', 322, 8, 15, 527931) brought out an adaptation of the work by John S. Hoyland.
('50', 322, 8, 16, 527989) (For Gandhijis permission for its publication, vide Letter to J. S. Hoyland, 15 12 1933.) But in order to make the poems acceptable to English readers, Hoyland omitted a great deal, chiefly Indian names and symbolism but also much else so that at places it is difficult to recognize the original in the adaptation.
('50', 322, 8, 17, 528304) See for instance Gandhijis translation of verse 8 and Hoylands adaptation of it (p.

('50', 323, 4, 5, 529136) Bowing to the earth, we learn to be humble as the earth which supports the beings that tread upon it.
('50', 323, 4, 6, 529238) Earth therefore is rightly the consort of the Preserver.

('50', 324, 2, 8, 530473) Such a guru is a rarity, at least nowadays.

('50', 391, 5, 14, 639058) If there is deep down the desire for it, it will not be relinquished.
('50', 391, 5, 15, 639128) A man may wear the garb of a sannyasi but that will bring him no nearer the goal if the garb only hides the desire that has its full possession of the wearer.
('50', 391, 5, 16, 639287) So long as desire, anger, greed and passion are not rooted out, the thing will come to the surface the moment there is an opportunity; the very sannyasa may become an additional source of self indulgence.
('50', 391, 5, 17, 639492) Just as the seed does not sprout during the dry hot season but does so as soon as the rains come, so is it with mans desires; they await the due season.
('50', 391, 5, 18, 639645) Just as iron moves in front of a magnet so do the senses move when they are face to face with their objects.
('50', 391, 5, 19, 639754) They are still for want of opportunity but they run riot as soon as the opportunity comes.
('50', 391, 5, 20, 639845) Therefore mere external renunciation will not answer if there is no corresponding response within.
('50', 391, 5, 21, 639944) Such external renunciation will mean licence even from the restraints of Varnashrama (the four divisions) and is likely to result in harm.
('50', 391, 5, 22, 640083) Such a man becomes useless like milk gone bad.
('50', 391, 5, 23, 640130) It wont yield ghee or butter and is unfit to drink.

('50', 403, 2, 12, 661287) Would that obstruction to right conduct too was removed and there was concentration on pure self.
('50', 403, 2, 13, 661385) Would that there was steadfastness of the three yugas (?) running practically to the time of death and that steadfastness was incapable of being shaken by sufferings however great.
('50', 403, 2, 14, 661566) Would that even the yoga was only for attaining greater restraint over self and that there was implicit obedience to the precepts of the Jina for the sake of the soul.
('50', 403, 2, 15, 661734) Would that even that activity also perceptibly decreased and I was absorbed in self realization.
('50', 403, 2, 16, 661831) Would that there were neither likes nor dislikes in matters received through the senses and that I was unaffected by their play.
('50', 403, 2, 17, 661960) Would that I engaged in activities that came to me in due course and was not enslaved by time, place or circumstance.
('50', 403, 2, 18, 662078) Would that I was angered against anger and that against respect paid to me I had humility enough not to be affected by it.

('50', 404, 1, 2, 662246) Would that in respect of maya I was but a witness to its blandishments and against ambition I had ambition to thwart it, I had no anger against even the extreme wrongdoer and had no pride if an emperor paid respects to me, that I was unmoved even if the body perished and had no desire even for the greatest gifts.
('50', 404, 1, 3, 662561) That I was the same to friend and foe alike as towards praise or insult, that there was [in ]difference in me whether I lived or died, that even regarding the cycles of birth and death or salvation I had only the simple natural state that I had crossed the alluring ocean of different temptations and was intent upon the state where all the passions are 1 quenched, that at the time [of] death I would shed all desire and had perfect knowledge, that all the four kinds of activities were to me like a burnt hope mere ashes, that I was living out only this life and that after that there was no more birth.
('50', 404, 1, 4, 663167) That I had no desire for even an atom, that I was sinless, immovable and intent upon self realization, that I was absorbed in the spotless, eternal everloving, neither small nor big, formless self acting Being, that owing to past actions I was fit for the abode of the releasedwhere [there is] eternal bliss, perfect perception and perfect experience.
('50', 404, 1, 5, 663519) This is the state which the all knowing Jina realized but could not describe.
('50', 404, 1, 6, 663597) How can any other person describe it?
('50', 404, 1, 7, 663635) It is capable only of being experienced.
('50', 404, 1, 8, 663676) I have set my heart upon that state though it may be at present beyond my capacity.
('50', 404, 1, 9, 663760) Nevertheless Rajchand is determined that God willing he will attain that state.

('50', 404, 2, 12, 663929) They never set their gaze upon Him, they would not be calm enough even to have a glimpse of Him.
('50', 404, 2, 13, 664026) They have been immersed in sorrows or enjoyments, have burnt themselves with their heat.
('50', 404, 2, 14, 664115) They have not devoted themselves to having Gods darshan (sight) and yet God is everywhere, He fills His creation.
('50', 404, 2, 15, 664229) Among the movable and the immovable objects there is not an atom but has His presence in it.
('50', 404, 2, 16, 664322) He is like the heavens pervading all.
('50', 404, 2, 17, 664360) He is like the air inhabiting my heart.
('50', 404, 2, 18, 664400) If I would but look at Him, He is there staring me in the face.

('50', 405, 1, 8, 664910) When will this deep darkness be dispelled?
('50', 405, 1, 9, 664953) O God, listen to my petition and lift this dead curtain.

('50', 405, 1, 11, 665050) O eyes, get rid of the laziness and calmly see Him.

('50', 405, 5, 16, 665254) SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13/16, 1930
('50', 405, 6, 17, 665293) NARANDAS, This time I got your packet at 12 noon on Wednesday.
('50', 405, 6, 18, 665356) I got a copy of the booklet Gitabodh 1. I take it that those who make notes about the work they do as yajna do so in their dairy.
('50', 405, 6, 19, 665486) If you remind people often enough about this, they will be careful.
('50', 405, 6, 20, 665554) See that everyone is soon able to use the instruments for weighing yarn and testing its strength.
('50', 405, 6, 21, 665652) I have replied to Mahadevs questions in my letter to Durga, and to questions about my health in my letter to Kakasaheb.
('50', 405, 6, 22, 665772) Therefore read both the letters.
('50', 405, 6, 23, 665805) Afternoon
('50', 405, 7, 24, 665815) There was a letter from Jayaprakash saying that Prabhavati would go over there.
('50', 405, 7, 25, 665895) She may have even arrived there before you get this letter.
('50', 405, 7, 26, 665955) If she comes, look after her very carefully.
('50', 405, 7, 27, 666000) She gets faint ing fits and these should stop immediately in the Ashram.
('50', 405, 7, 28, 666073) You may buy any fruits which may be necessary for her.
('50', 405, 7, 29, 666128) Consult a doctor if necessary.
('50', 405, 7, 30, 666159) You may write to me about her whenever you wish to.

('50', 406, 0, 1, 666443) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1932 407
('50', 406, 1, 2, 666488) Night, December 15, 1930 I got Manilals letter.
('50', 406, 1, 3, 666536) I felt relieved.
('50', 406, 1, 4, 666553) Let him observe as many restriction as he chooses, but not at the cost of his health.
('50', 406, 1, 5, 666639) 110 115 lb.
('50', 406, 1, 6, 666651) is certainly low weight.
('50', 406, 1, 7, 666676) Manilal should maintain his weight between 120 and 125; if, however, he has kept up his strength, he will regain that level after he is released.
('50', 406, 1, 8, 666822) He should guard against any disease insidiously attacking him.
('50', 406, 1, 9, 666885) The reading which he has done is quite good, but in order to derive the fullest benefit from his work he should carry out my suggestions as far as possible.
('50', 406, 1, 10, 667042) Really speaking, however, when he has the benefit of the company of a person like Nanabhai 1, and will now have the benefit of Mahadevs company, there should hardly be any need for me to guide him.
('50', 406, 1, 11, 667240) The reading he is doing at present is good indeed.
('50', 406, 1, 12, 667291) There is little in it, however, to be remembered and digested.
('50', 406, 1, 13, 667354) The reading which I have suggested will, while developing his memory and power of thinking, also beinteresting to him.
('50', 406, 1, 14, 667473) Jivanshodhan 2 can be understood only if it is read carefully twice or thrice.
('50', 406, 1, 15, 667552) He is doing right in reading it once again.
('50', 406, 1, 16, 667596) One reason why my writings are easy to follow is that these days I write with the sole aim of making myself easily understood by all the inmates of the Ashram.
('50', 406, 1, 17, 667756) Formerly too I wrote with the general public in view, and not for men of learning.
('50', 406, 1, 18, 667839) It is natural, therefore, that my writings should be easy to understand.
('50', 406, 1, 19, 667912) Let him write to me again.
('50', 406, 1, 20, 667939) He should write as often as he gets time and is permitted to do so.
('50', 406, 1, 21, 668007) I have had no reply to my inquiry about Devdass letter.
('50', 406, 1, 22, 668063) I have even suggested that he should write again.
('50', 406, 1, 23, 668113) If the Bombay air suits Jamna, do not insist on her returning to the Ashram.
('50', 406, 1, 24, 668190) Do you still make bread there?
('50', 406, 1, 25, 668221) If you do, of what quality are you able to make it, and who actua lly makes it?
('50', 406, 1, 26, 668301) If it is of good quality and if anyone is coming on a visit here, send a sample.
('50', 406, 1, 27, 668382) You had described the process of making it, but it did not succeed here.
('50', 406, 1, 28, 668455) I have not been able to discover where the error lay.
('50', 406, 1, 29, 668509) I can say that, up to this evening, the bhakhari of jowar and bajra seems to have done me no harm.
('50', 406, 1, 30, 668608) I eat very little in bulk but can keep up my strength all right.
('50', 406, 1, 31, 668673) No one should worry on my account.
('50', 406, 1, 32, 668708) I will not be obstinate and cling to the experiment.

('50', 407, 1, 2, 668888) I did not find Hariyomaljis and Gijubhais letters.
('50', 407, 1, 3, 668939) I wonder if Gijubhai was written in place of Haribhai.
('50', 407, 1, 4, 668994) I did not find the latters name in Radhas note.

('50', 407, 3, 6, 669064) Tuesday Morning, December 16, 1930 Pranayama (control of breath) and asanas (yogic postures) are referred to appreciatively in this chapter, but we should remember that at the same time the Lord has stressed the need for brahmacharya, i.e., keeping the observances calculated to take us nearer and nearer to God.
('50', 407, 3, 7, 669377) It should be clearly understood that the mere practice of asanas and the like can never take us to the goal of even mindedness.
('50', 407, 3, 8, 669505) Asanas and pranayama may be of some slight help in steadying the mind and making it single purposed, provided that they are practised to that end.
('50', 407, 3, 9, 669652) Otherwise they are no better than other methods of physical training.
('50', 407, 3, 10, 669722) They are very useful indeed as physical exercise and I believe that this type of exercise is good for the soul, and may be performed from a bodily standpoint.
('50', 407, 3, 11, 669881) But I have observed that these practices do only harm when indulged in for the acquisition of supernormal powers (siddhi) and the performance of miracles.
('50', 407, 3, 12, 670036) This chapter should be studied as a summary of the teaching in the preceding three chapters.
('50', 407, 3, 13, 670129) It cheers us up in our spiritual struggle.
('50', 407, 3, 14, 670172) We should never be down hearted and give up the endeavour to reach evenness of temper.

('50', 408, 3, 5, 670596) Can you give me the figures of khadi production in Malabar, or at least in Cochin?
('50', 408, 3, 6, 670679) Do you know where Ramachandran is?

('50', 408, 7, 12, 670909) Kakasahebs place is now taken by Pyarelal.
('50', 408, 7, 13, 670952) He spins faster and, therefore, a greater quantity of cotton will be consumed than formerly.
('50', 408, 7, 14, 671045) Kindly inform the people you buy the cotton from, that it is full of particles and seeds.
('50', 408, 7, 15, 671135) As a result, we have to spend much time in cleaning it and some of the cotton is wasted.
('50', 408, 7, 16, 671224) I hope I do not give you too much trouble.
('50', 408, 7, 17, 671267) I do believe that, if you store cotton for my sake, you will also be able to use it for other purposes.
('50', 408, 7, 18, 671371) I hope all your sisters are quite well.

('50', 409, 3, 4, 671662) MANU, I got your letter.
('50', 409, 3, 5, 671687) Though you are so near the Ashram, I do not send this letter along with the other post for the Ashram, and delay its reaching you by some days.
('50', 409, 3, 6, 671831) Instead, I am taking the risk and writing it directly to you.
('50', 409, 3, 7, 671893) I believe you will get it.
('50', 409, 3, 8, 671920) Why do you give way to despair?
('50', 409, 3, 9, 671952) One who believes in God can never feel despair.
('50', 409, 3, 10, 672000) Since you are very eager to work, you earn merit as if you had been actually working.
('50', 409, 3, 11, 672086) Why, then, do you feel impatient?
('50', 409, 3, 12, 672120) Who knows for what service God has destined you?
('50', 409, 3, 13, 672169) Or how can we say that your aspirations in themselves are not sufficient for His work?
('50', 409, 3, 14, 672256) You do perform the daily yajna of spinning; what else is it, if not service?
('50', 409, 3, 15, 672333) Start repeating Ramanama and rouse yourself.
('50', 409, 3, 16, 672378) Shake off despair.
('50', 409, 3, 17, 672397) Banish the very thoughts of weakness and disease.
('50', 409, 3, 18, 672447) If you take interest in the Gita and the Ramayana, go on repeating to yourself verses from them.

('50', 409, 8, 27, 672758) BHAI GHANSHYAMDASJI, I have your letter.
('50', 409, 8, 28, 672799) Even if I agree to see you I am afraid the permission will not be granted.
('50', 409, 8, 29, 672874) Therefore for the time being, we must be content with letters alone.
('50', 409, 8, 30, 672943) By speculation I did not mean that no forward transactions should be entered into.
('50', 409, 8, 31, 673026) Speculation means gambling.
('50', 409, 8, 32, 673054) With the expectation that market prices will go up I buy 1,000 bales of cotton.
('50', 409, 8, 33, 673134) I do not need any cotton, I do not even store it in any warehouse.
('50', 409, 8, 34, 673201) Only a book transaction is made.
('50', 409, 8, 35, 673234) Now I await a rise in price.
('50', 409, 8, 36, 673263) I sell the cotton when it rises; this I consider gambling.
('50', 409, 8, 37, 673322) The nation or, rather, the world has lost a great deal through such

('50', 410, 1, 2, 673435) transactions.
('50', 410, 1, 3, 673449) This was what I meant in my letter 1. Yes, I expect much more than this, but, at present, you will not be up to that.
('50', 410, 1, 4, 673567) Without at all depending upon future market prices, to sell the commodities at a little more than the cost price is what I consider unsullied trade.
('50', 410, 1, 5, 673716) Today it might be difficult to conduct such business, but ultimately, it might bear fruit.
('50', 410, 1, 6, 673807) You might remember this is what I visualize for khadi.
('50', 410, 1, 7, 673862) But I know this is a tall order.
('50', 410, 1, 8, 673895) I shall be very happy and content if you brothers can give up speculation.
('50', 410, 1, 9, 673970) However, do only what is intelligently acceptable and within your power.
('50', 410, 1, 10, 674043) I would not at all wish that you should act upon the suggestion simply because it happens to be mine and that, too, sent from jail.
('50', 410, 1, 11, 674175) Faith should not have a place where reasoning is applicable.
('50', 410, 1, 12, 674236) Jayaprakash informs me that, although you are not recruiting any new people just now, he will be absorbed somewhere because of my recommendation 2. I certainly hold that Jayaprakash is a worthy young man but I do not wish that a post be created where none exists today.
('50', 410, 1, 13, 674506) I was a little worried to read of Malaviyajis fever in the news papers.
('50', 410, 1, 14, 674578) I am relieved now.
('50', 410, 1, 15, 674597) I hope he will emerge from the jail in good health.
('50', 410, 1, 16, 674649) I am glad about your health too.
('50', 410, 1, 17, 674682) I am again experi menting with a milkless diet.
('50', 410, 1, 18, 674730) This time constipation was res ponsible for it.
('50', 410, 1, 19, 674778) Now I am taking chapatis prepared from millet for the prisoners, vegetables, three tolas of almonds and dates.
('50', 410, 1, 20, 674889) I am trying to give up dates.
('50', 410, 1, 21, 674919) Constipation has disappeared.
('50', 410, 1, 22, 674949) I shall revert to milk if I lose strength.
('50', 410, 1, 23, 674992) It is nearly a month since I gave up milk.

('50', 410, 5, 28, 675191) I have in general given the literal translation of Bhajanavali 3. Now it is up to Mirabehn.
('50', 410, 5, 29, 675283) I do not consider the translation worth publishing.

('50', 411, 1, 3, 675492) How can I choose from the bhajans?
('50', 411, 1, 4, 675527) Different bhajans appeal on different occasions.
('50', 411, 1, 5, 675576) We might say that all are well liked.
('50', 411, 1, 6, 675614) But I do wish to drop a few in the new edition.
('50', 411, 1, 7, 675662) In Who is not devoted to Rama and Vaidehi 1 I take Rama to mean Daridranarayana and it is our duty to forsake the company of one who does not serve Daridranarayana.
('50', 411, 1, 8, 675827) Non co operation emanates from that.
('50', 411, 1, 9, 675864) Thanks for making a start in Gujarati.
('50', 411, 1, 10, 675903) Considering all this connection with Gujarat, it is good to learn the language too.
('50', 411, 1, 11, 675987) As a matter of fact, the more Indian languages one knows the better.
('50', 411, 1, 12, 676056) I do not use the enema regularly.
('50', 411, 1, 13, 676090) I regard it efficacious to use only when the need arises.
('50', 411, 1, 14, 676148) To use it daily is not good.
('50', 411, 1, 15, 676177) It can also prove harmful.

('50', 411, 4, 23, 676543) But how will you define art?
('50', 411, 4, 24, 676572) Art is skill in work.
('50', 411, 4, 25, 676594) The yoga of the third chapter of the Gita is perfect art.
('50', 411, 4, 26, 676652) And this is also true about the activities generally known as art.
('50', 411, 4, 27, 676719) Any activity in which the masses cannot participate is not art, but a kind of self indulgence, whether it concerns the voice or clothes or stone.
('50', 411, 4, 28, 676865) Large numbers singing Ramdhun in unison is art, which ought to be cultivated.
('50', 411, 4, 29, 676943) Many temples have art, and their art is something which can be appreciated by the masses.
('50', 411, 4, 30, 677033) The daily worship and readings from holy books which take place in temples, if kept within measure and done with genuine faith, are the best form of art.
('50', 411, 4, 31, 677187) Thus, there is art wherever harmony prevails as regards the time, the place and the occasion.
('50', 411, 4, 32, 677281) I do not like films.
('50', 411, 4, 33, 677302) I have never gone to a cinema.

('50', 412, 2, 5, 677625) They ought to gain strength.
('50', 412, 2, 6, 677654) If their present diet is kept up and they get regular exercise, they certainly will.
('50', 412, 2, 7, 677739) You may write and make whatever suggestions you think necessary regarding them to the people at Calcutta and then stop worring about the matter.

('50', 412, 11, 23, 678645) Yes, I have great hopes of Kanta.

('50', 413, 3, 5, 679047) I am quite clear that you should not take Rs. 25 for clearing the debt to Father in law.
('50', 413, 3, 6, 679136) There is no hurry about paying it off.
('50', 413, 3, 7, 679175) It is good for you to nurse the feeling that you should pay.
('50', 413, 3, 8, 679236) As you become hardy, you might save something out of Rs. 75. But you may not deny yourself necessaries.

('50', 416, 6, 14, 683055) MIRA, Your letter betrays about my health an anxiety which is wholly unnecessary.
('50', 416, 6, 15, 683137) The weight which was taken on Thursday showed an increase of 1 1/2 1b., a very good increase in seven days.
('50', 416, 6, 16, 683245) Nor do I feel any weakness.
('50', 416, 6, 17, 683273) I do my two hours spinning on the takli standing as a rule without feeling any appreciable fatigue.
('50', 416, 6, 18, 683373) I have just now sat down to write this after finishing the takli.
('50', 416, 6, 19, 683439) All the mistakes made last time are being avoided.
('50', 416, 6, 20, 683490) Stools are well formed.
('50', 416, 6, 21, 683514) Pyarelal tells me there is no smell worth noticing.
('50', 416, 6, 22, 683566) The food is all well cooked, i.e., vegetables and chapati.
('50', 416, 6, 23, 683625) The letter is rebaked when I receive it.
('50', 416, 6, 24, 683666) Last time, you should remember, it was all raw food including cereals and pulses.
('50', 416, 6, 25, 683748) 1 As a matter of fact, I am now taking practically what I was taking before starting the raw cereals.
('50', 416, 6, 26, 683850) The only difference is taking bajri or jwari in the place of wheat.
('50', 416, 6, 27, 683918) Perhaps it is a change for the better.
('50', 416, 6, 28, 683957) I am taking once boiling water, lemon and salt.
('50', 416, 6, 29, 684005) In spite of all this apparent improve [ment] if I find any irregularity about the stools or weakness (persistent) or a continuing decrease in weight, in any one of the three things happening, I shall go back to milk.
('50', 416, 6, 30, 684222) But just now with the good feel about the health I must not deprive myself of the joy of avoiding milk and taking the bajri or jwari chapati.

('50', 417, 1, 5, 684934) Any pressure on the mind reacts immediately on your body.
('50', 417, 1, 6, 684992) This anxiety complex, you should try to throw off.
('50', 417, 1, 7, 685043) Be careful for no thing. Look at the lilies of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin and yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. I do not know whether I have quoted correctly.
('50', 417, 1, 8, 685252) Anyhow the lilies only seem neither to toil nor to spin.
('50', 417, 1, 9, 685309) They do both but so naturally that we do not notice their toilsome spin.
('50', 417, 1, 10, 685382) If they did not toil, they would wither.

('50', 417, 1, 12, 685510) But when we toil like them detachedly, our toil will not be noticed and therefore will not adversely affect the body.

('50', 417, 1, 14, 685638) You and I and all of us have to make a conscious and deliberate effort to realize this blessed state.
('50', 417, 1, 15, 685740) Or else, our reading of the Gita is vain.

('50', 417, 1, 17, 685839) You know how Gujarati women have burnt themselves over the use of the primus.
('50', 417, 1, 18, 685917) The loose saris lend themselves to the wick especially at the time of lighting it.
('50', 417, 1, 19, 686000) As it is kept on the floor, they have to bend and the rising flame easily catches a fold or a loose end of the sari.
('50', 417, 1, 20, 686117) It may be wise for you, therefore, to keep it on a metalmounted stool.
('50', 417, 1, 21, 686188) Then too there is precious little room in your little dormitory.
('50', 417, 1, 22, 686253) Anyway, you have my warning.
('50', 417, 1, 23, 686282) You will now take what precautions you may think right.
('50', 417, 1, 24, 686338) In my seclusion, the idea of your bringing out a paper does not at all commend itself to me.
('50', 417, 1, 25, 686431) That ties you down and I should like you to remain free for what comes to your lot.
('50', 417, 1, 26, 686515) And then the paper will absorb the labour of several others.
('50', 417, 1, 27, 686576) I dread the idea.
('50', 417, 1, 28, 686594) But my opinion has no value.
('50', 417, 1, 29, 686623) You and the other workers are the best judges.
('50', 417, 1, 30, 686670) Yes, I have jut finished the first part of the introduction to my translation of the Gita 1. I hope to do at least a paragraph every day.
('50', 417, 1, 31, 686808) If I succeed, the introduction cannot take long.
('50', 417, 1, 32, 686857) The new Gandiv 2 has almost all the improvements I had contemplated.
('50', 417, 1, 33, 686926) It has two springs for the two mals.
('50', 417, 1, 34, 686963) It is working like a

('50', 418, 1, 3, 687130) For the execu tion of these improvement I am thankful to the Superintendent and an English co prisoner, who is a clever mechanic and who takes a serious interest in the work.
('50', 418, 1, 4, 687305) He has applied the spring to the holder in an original way.
('50', 418, 1, 5, 687365) The idea is incredibly simple and equally effective.
('50', 418, 1, 6, 687418) But I must not keep you over this any longer.
('50', 418, 1, 7, 687464) I am glad you have taken Surendra in hand.
('50', 418, 1, 8, 687507) It is criminal how he neglects his body.
('50', 418, 1, 9, 687548) Even St. Francis, though he called his body an ass, took some care of it.
('50', 418, 1, 10, 687622) And after all the ass is a most useful and patient animal.
('50', 418, 1, 11, 687681) The brother ass can be equally useful if properly treated and neither pampered nor neglected.
('50', 418, 1, 12, 687775) And now here is the first verse of the morning prayer : Early in the morning, I call to mind that Being which is felt in the heart, which is sat (the eternal), chit (knowledge), sukham (blis), which is the state reached by perfect men and which is the super state.
('50', 418, 1, 13, 688040) I am that immaculate Brahman which ever notes the states of dream, wakefulness and deep sleep, not this body, the compound made of the elements (earth, water, space, light and air). You will be interested to know that the first verse was commended on 6th May last.
('50', 418, 2, 14, 688305) I am sorry that the very first verse needed correcting.
('50', 418, 2, 15, 688361) The more I think, the more clearly I see the meaning.
('50', 418, 2, 16, 688415) And then I dont mind how often I cut about the translation.
('50', 418, 2, 17, 688475) Formerly I used to shudder to utter this verse thinking that the claim made therein was arrogant.
('50', 418, 2, 18, 688573) But when I saw the meaning more clearly, I perceived at once that it was the very best thought with which to commence the day.
('50', 418, 2, 19, 688700) It is a solemn declaration that we are not the changeful bodies which require sleep, etc., but deep down, we are the Being, the witness pervading the countless bodies.
('50', 418, 2, 20, 688868) The first part is the recalling to mind the presence of the vital principle and the second part is the affirmation that we are that vital principle.
('50', 418, 2, 21, 689017) The description of the Being, the Brahman, is also quite apposite.
('50', 418, 2, 22, 689084) It is, nothing else is (sat), it is all knowledge or light (chit), and naturally, therefore, it is all bliss (sukham) or the word generally used is anand.
('50', 418, 2, 23, 689239) The rest is simple.
('50', 418, 2, 24, 689259) You will compare this translation with what you have already, translated by Valjibhai.
('50', 418, 2, 25, 689346) If there is a material difference, let me have his translation.
('50', 418, 2, 26, 689410) In scholarship I should yield the palm to him.
('50', 418, 2, 27, 689457) So now God willing, you may expect a present of this character every week.

('50', 419, 4, 7, 689871) Its enthusiasm pleased me.
('50', 419, 4, 8, 689898) But, according to our principle, I cannot give any decision about the work being done there.
('50', 419, 4, 9, 689991) Nor should you rely upon the opinion of a prisoner.
('50', 419, 4, 10, 690043) I have already explained the proper relations between a leader and the volunteers working under him or her.
('50', 419, 4, 11, 690151) You should discuss with Mithubehn herself your differences with her.
('50', 419, 4, 12, 690220) This is the attitude I have adopted from the beginning and I do not wish to go further than this.
('50', 419, 4, 13, 690318) You are free to follow what seems to you your dharma.
('50', 419, 4, 14, 690372) We observe the rules and regulations in order that we may know this dharma.
('50', 419, 4, 15, 690448) The inner voice does not speak in every person.

('50', 419, 9, 25, 690903) If we proceed thus, we shall gradually be able to overcome all of them.

('50', 422, 2, 3, 693535) December 22, 1930
('50', 422, 3, 4, 693553) GANGABEHN (SENIOR), It no doubt puts a very heavy responsibility on us when parents of grown up girls entrust them to us.
('50', 422, 3, 5, 693675) God will help us to bear it.
('50', 422, 3, 6, 693704) When, however, you feel in a particular case that the responsibility will be beyond your strength, plainly refuse to accept it.
('50', 422, 3, 7, 693832) Sent away any girl who refuses to submit to your discipline.
('50', 422, 3, 8, 693893) Explain the position clearly to the parents and the girl before you accept her.
('50', 422, 3, 9, 693973) If we do not take such steps of practical wisdom, God will not help us.
('50', 422, 3, 10, 694045) He never helps the timid, the lethargic and those who are not vigilant.
('50', 422, 3, 11, 694117) Have any facilities you require, but safeguard your health.
('50', 422, 3, 12, 694177) If you think that tea and coffee are essential for it, take either without the slightest hesitation or without feeling ashamed about doing so.
('50', 422, 3, 13, 694320) Giving up tea or coffee is not at present the purpose of your sadhana; that purpose is the service of those among the inmates of the Ashram who suffer.
('50', 422, 3, 14, 694472) I cannot think of one single remedy which will help Madhu and all others in the Ashram who suffer from constipation.
('50', 422, 3, 15, 694589) I will tell you how I overcame it in my case.
('50', 422, 3, 16, 694635) For three or four days, I ate only cooked greens like tanka.
('50', 422, 3, 17, 694696) That completely restored my bowel movement.
('50', 422, 3, 18, 694740) Then I added almonds to the diet.
('50', 422, 3, 19, 694774) You do not need them for the people there.
('50', 422, 3, 20, 694817) Perhaps you will not get even greens.
('50', 422, 3, 21, 694855) But you can certainly get onions.
('50', 422, 3, 22, 694889) If those who suffer from constipation eat boiled onions, that, too, will probably help them.
('50', 422, 3, 23, 694982) If you can get tomatoes, you may mix them with onions.
('50', 422, 3, 24, 695037) If simple boiled onions do not taste well, even with the addition of salt, and if tomatoes are not available, they may use kokum.
('50', 422, 3, 25, 695167) The persons may try shirshasan.
('50', 422, 3, 26, 695199) It has helped people to overcome constipation from which they had suffered many years.
('50', 422, 3, 27, 695286) The asana should be done only on an empty stomach.
('50', 422, 3, 28, 695337) It is quite easy to do.
('50', 422, 3, 29, 695361) The skirt should be tucked up behind and one should stand on ones head, supporting the body against a wall.
('50', 422, 3, 30, 695469) After some practice the support of the wall will not be necessary.
('50', 422, 3, 31, 695536) The head should be supported by the palms joined together.
('50', 422, 3, 32, 695595) I suppose you know that these days I eat the rotlas of jowar and bajra, and vegetables, served to prisoners in jail.
('50', 422, 3, 33, 695712) The vegetables for me have to be cooked separately, because those cooked

('50', 423, 4, 9, 696160) PREMA, I got your letter full of information.
('50', 423, 4, 10, 696206) Both the meanings of nij anamagrahi 1 are good.
('50', 423, 4, 11, 696254) The meaning suggested by Narandas may suit Gujarati better, but the one suggested by you is not altogether in appropriate.
('50', 423, 4, 12, 696377) I imagine that you yourself are a little girl and reply to your question about prayer.
('50', 423, 4, 13, 696464) Just as we have parents who gave birth to us, so they had their parents who brought them into the world.
('50', 423, 4, 14, 696569) If we go further and further back like this, He whom we can conceive as the Father of all is God.
('50', 423, 4, 15, 696667) It is because He is that that we also call Him the Creator.
('50', 423, 4, 16, 696727) As our parents often come to know what we want without our telling them, so does God know our wishes.
('50', 423, 4, 17, 696829) If our human parents have this power to know what we want, the Creator of all must have infinitely greater power to know our heart.
('50', 423, 4, 18, 696961) That is why we also think of God as Antaryami, the Dweller within.
('50', 423, 4, 19, 697028) It is not necessary that we should be able to see Him.
('50', 423, 4, 20, 697083) We have never seen a good many of our relations.
('50', 423, 4, 21, 697132) Somebodys parents may have gone away to a foreign country or died while he or she was a child, but such a man or woman trusts other people and believes that the parents live or lived.
('50', 423, 4, 22, 697316) Similarly, we should trust the testimony of saints about the existence of God and believe that the Antaryami does exist.
('50', 423, 4, 23, 697437) If that is so, it is easy to understand why we should sing bhajans to Him and pray to Him.
('50', 423, 4, 24, 697528) If we are good children, we bow to our parents, prostrating ourselves before them, the first thing in the morning after leaving bed and the last thing at night when going to bed.
('50', 423, 4, 25, 697707) We should do the same to God.
('50', 423, 4, 26, 697737) And as we tell our parents what we desire, so we should tell God.
('50', 423, 4, 27, 697803) This should be enough for today.
('50', 423, 4, 28, 697836) If you do not understand anything in this, do not hesitate to question me.

('50', 424, 2, 3, 698110) December 22, 1930
('50', 424, 3, 4, 698128) DEAR SISTER, I got the two boxes of dates and the cotton send by you.
('50', 424, 3, 5, 698198) Need I thank you for them?
('50', 424, 3, 6, 698225) Write to Vithaldas and tell him that the dates were excellent.
('50', 424, 3, 7, 698288) This does not mean, of course, that he should send me such dates more often.
('50', 424, 3, 8, 698365) My request was that he should communicate the price to the Superintendent here and supply the dates as and when required, provided his brother orders enough quantity to spare some and sell it.
('50', 424, 3, 9, 698558) I got your letter too.
('50', 424, 3, 10, 698581) I will write to you when I require more cotton.

('50', 424, 8, 15, 698793) LILAVATI, You are being really tested.
('50', 424, 8, 16, 698832) See that you do not fail in the test.
('50', 424, 8, 17, 698870) One preserves ones self respect better by giving up the very desire for being respected.
('50', 424, 8, 18, 698959) You will not get another Gangabehn who will look after you like a mother as she does.
('50', 424, 8, 19, 699045) She has an overbearing temper.
('50', 424, 8, 20, 699076) Endure it.
('50', 424, 8, 21, 699087) Understand and appreciate her zeal for service and her sympathy for all.
('50', 424, 8, 22, 699160) Anyone who wishes to serve must learn to act as a member of an organization.
('50', 424, 8, 23, 699237) To do this means to obey somebodys authority.
('50', 424, 8, 24, 699283) Ones superior has his or her superior too.
('50', 424, 8, 25, 699326) Think over the verses of Chapter XII of the Gita.
('50', 424, 8, 26, 699376) One of them says that a devotee and lover of God is equally indifferent to respect and disrespect, to praise and censure, and holds friend and foe in equal regard.
('50', 424, 8, 27, 699540) Let this be true about you.
('50', 424, 8, 28, 699568) Do not feel it a burden to write to me.

('50', 425, 3, 4, 699775) PRABHAVATI, I have your letter.
('50', 425, 3, 5, 699807) From your postcard received yesterday, I thought I would receive a letter today, but I did not get one.
('50', 425, 3, 6, 699911) From Jayaprakashs letter it would seem you have now gone to the Ashram.
('50', 425, 3, 7, 699983) But it is not clear from your letters whether you have.
('50', 425, 3, 8, 700039) I should like you to go to the Ashram as soon as possible.
('50', 425, 3, 9, 700098) I do not like your continuing to get the fainting fits.
('50', 425, 3, 10, 700154) I must now get a report of your talks with Father.
('50', 425, 3, 11, 700205) Incidentally, that will give me news about his health too.
('50', 425, 3, 12, 700264) I am quite well.
('50', 425, 3, 13, 700281) So far, I have been able to digest jowar and bajra.

('50', 425, 7, 17, 700429) Thursday Morning, December 18/23, 1930
('50', 425, 8, 18, 700468) NARANDAS, I got your packet yesterday evening.
('50', 425, 8, 19, 700515) The letters to the Ashram which I handed in this time, that is, on Tuesday last, should reach you on Thursday, that is, today.
('50', 425, 8, 20, 700642) I suggested to the official here to post them immediately, if possible, and he told me afterwards that this weeks letters were posted on Tuesday itself.
('50', 425, 8, 21, 700795) I welcome your long letters, but I shall not be happy if you take special trouble to make them long.
('50', 425, 8, 22, 700896) I can understand what a burden you are carrying.
('50', 425, 8, 23, 700945) I did not want an explanation in regard to Keshu.
('50', 425, 8, 24, 700995) But I can understand your having given it so that you could your pour out your heart and satisfy yourself.
('50', 425, 8, 25, 701102) I had a postcard from Surajbhan, in which he says that he would be happy if Yashodadevi was called to the Ashram.
('50', 425, 8, 26, 701216) She lives with the family of Lala Dunichand, a lawyer, in Ambala.
('50', 425, 8, 27, 701282) Write to him.
('50', 425, 8, 28, 701296) The Ratilal episode is both happy and painful.
('50', 425, 8, 29, 701343) His foolishness is painful, but the display of humanity by the merchant, who returned the diamond, and by Gopi, who returned the money, makes one
('50', 426, 0, 1, 701489) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1932 427
('50', 426, 1, 2, 701534) In my eyes, their subsequent conduct wipes out their initial guilt.
('50', 426, 1, 3, 701602) Champa, of course, has always been foolish.
('50', 426, 1, 4, 701646) She listens to no persuasion and re mains fond of diamonds and other jewels, and loses money in conse quence.
('50', 426, 1, 5, 701756) Ratilal must have returned.
('50', 426, 1, 6, 701784) Even if he has not returned, that will not worry me.
('50', 426, 1, 7, 701837) God always saves him.
('50', 426, 1, 8, 701859) But this is what life is.
('50', 426, 1, 9, 701885) We pass our time in undoing the consequences of one anothers error.
('50', 426, 1, 10, 701953) For those who can remain unattached while doing this, their labour is not wasted.
('50', 426, 1, 11, 702035) To them it is a spiritual striving and they realize God through it.
('50', 426, 1, 12, 702103) I had an experience of this yesterday when I saw God in a worm and a weevil.
('50', 426, 1, 13, 702180) You are wrong if you think that you know Pyarelal fully.
('50', 426, 1, 14, 702237) Being a poet, he is bound to be dreaming always.
('50', 426, 1, 15, 702286) I asked him to remove a worm from the dates.
('50', 426, 1, 16, 702331) He should have put it in a safe corner, but, instead of thinking about his duty, he was thinking of something else, God knows what, and he put the worm in the wash basin.
('50', 426, 1, 17, 702502) The weevil, too, was dropped into the same.
('50', 426, 1, 18, 702546) If now I washed my hands or face in the basin, I would be the cause of the death of both.
('50', 426, 1, 19, 702636) I therefore, decided not to wash in it.
('50', 426, 1, 20, 702676) But when, after I had finished my work, I got ready to wash my hands, I did not see the worm and the weevil in the basin.
('50', 426, 1, 21, 702798) They had slowly moved away.
('50', 426, 1, 22, 702826) I look upon this experience as seeing God in the two worms.
('50', 426, 1, 23, 702886) An atheist or a rationalist would describe the incident as mere accident.
('50', 426, 1, 24, 702960) It was an accident, no doubt, but seeing God is also an accident.
('50', 426, 1, 25, 703026) If we but understand the truth, we would see Him every day; otherwise our whole life would pass without our seeing Him.
('50', 426, 1, 26, 703146) But I will not dwell further on this.
('50', 426, 1, 27, 703184) I wanted to note this incident in the diary yes terday, but, in my preoccupation with other work I wrote in it only about the daily sacrificial work and forgot to note this.
('50', 426, 1, 28, 703358) While writing about the merchant and Gopi, I remembered this holy experience and have shared it with you.
('50', 426, 1, 29, 703464) I learnt much else, too, from it yesterday.
('50', 426, 1, 30, 703508) God alone knows whether I shall be able to digest all that.
('50', 426, 1, 31, 703568) I will now answer your question here.
('50', 426, 1, 32, 703606) As we reflect deeper and remain peaceful, the meaning of ahimsa and truth becomes clearer.
('50', 426, 1, 33, 703697) I even realize the supreme utility of these two.
('50', 426, 1, 34, 703746) I believe we realize God in the degree to which we practise them.
('50', 426, 1, 35, 703812) I am gett ing more convinced than ever in my view that seeing God except through truth and ahimsa is an impossibility.
('50', 426, 1, 36, 703931) How can members of a group practise ahimsa towards one another?
('50', 426, 1, 37, 703995) They can do so by displaying generosity towards co workers and their faults and everyone regarding his own faults with strictness.
('50', 426, 1, 38, 704126) Anyone who observes the faults of others believes, whether he is conscious of the fact or not, that he does not have the same
('50', 427, 0, 1, 704252) 428 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 427, 1, 2, 704294) faults.
('50', 427, 1, 3, 704302) This gives rise to pride.
('50', 427, 1, 4, 704328) The true rule is that one should oneself observe all rules strictly and tolerate others who seem slack in observing them.
('50', 427, 1, 5, 704450) This is not kindness but strict justice.
('50', 427, 1, 6, 704491) Do we really know what effort is made by a person in observing a rule even as slackly as he does?
('50', 427, 1, 7, 704589) If our seeming strictness in observing rules comes naturally to us, what is the value of that strictness?
('50', 427, 1, 8, 704695) Is it any cause for wonder if a man like Bhima can lift a weight of four pounds with the utmost ease?
('50', 427, 1, 9, 704797) A girl, however, might slip down while trying to lift one pound; what would we think of that Bhima if he laughed at her then?
('50', 427, 1, 10, 704923) Really speaking, the effort of that girl to lift one pound is of much greater value than Bhimas lifting the weight of four pounds.
('50', 427, 1, 11, 705054) If Bhima had not lifted that weight, somebody else as strong would have lifted it; but by her effort to lift one pound that girl taught the world a lesson in doing ones duty and earned Gods grace.
('50', 427, 1, 12, 705251) Our dharma therefore does not lie in criticizing others and thereby commiting violence; it lies in becoming more vigilant ourselves.
('50', 427, 1, 13, 705384) If a strong bullock is yoked with one seemingly or really weak, the formers duty is to do more work and make up for the deficiency of the latter.
('50', 427, 1, 14, 705530) The driver goads it to labour harder.
('50', 427, 1, 15, 705568) If the strong bullock does not do the work expected of it, it is looked upon as a shirker; it is selfish and has no pity on the other one.
('50', 427, 1, 16, 705707) Let us never be shirkers.
('50', 427, 1, 17, 705733) Let us always do our duty.
('50', 427, 1, 18, 705760) God will judge us and our co workers.
('50', 427, 1, 19, 705798) He can see into the hearts of all.
('50', 427, 1, 20, 705833) We scarcely can see into our own.
('50', 427, 1, 21, 705867) We easily learn this if we strive sincerely to cultivate ahimsa.
('50', 427, 1, 22, 705932) Through the pursuit of truth, we know the measure of purity in our motives.
('50', 427, 1, 23, 706008) It increases our vigilance in regard to the smallest social duties and to our daily work.
('50', 427, 1, 24, 706098) If we strive for truth, we would not be content merely to attend prayers but would try to concentrate our attention on them.
('50', 427, 1, 25, 706223) We would try to follow the songs and the dis courses, be punctual in attending the prayers and respond to them as to a fresh experience every day.
('50', 427, 1, 26, 706370) The freshness does not consist in the variety of bhajans or other recitations, but should result from the increasing purity of our heart.
('50', 427, 1, 27, 706508) We should grow daily more contented and feel greater peace of mind.
('50', 427, 1, 28, 706576) If we do not have this experience, the fault will lie not with the quality of the prayers but with the element of untruth fulness in us.
('50', 427, 1, 29, 706713) If we attend the prayers with sincere devotion to truth, we would experience nothing but peace.
('50', 427, 1, 30, 706809) The faithful who visit temples do not observe the lack of cleanliness in them, or pay attention to the hypocrisy of the priest.
('50', 427, 1, 31, 706937) They do not see the image as a stone.
('50', 427, 1, 32, 706975) They experience peace in the midst of noise and return from
('50', 428, 0, 1, 707035) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1932 429
('50', 428, 1, 2, 707080) the temples purified in heart.
('50', 428, 1, 3, 707111) A person like me who feels suffocated by the noise there and sees the image only as a piece of stone should never visit a temple.
('50', 428, 1, 4, 707241) God appears to us in the form in which we worship Him.
('50', 428, 1, 5, 707296) For He is not outside of us.
('50', 428, 1, 6, 707325) He is in the hearts of us all.
('50', 428, 1, 7, 707356) If we understand this truth, our simplest and smallest actions would shed lustre on us and help us to see God.
('50', 428, 1, 8, 707467) In order that we may learn this, prayers, spinning, and other daily duties are like a spiritual lighthouse to us or a right angle which is the standard of measurement.
('50', 428, 1, 9, 707635) Saturday Morning If Giriraj remains quiet, that problem will then be over.
('50', 428, 1, 10, 707710) I see that it will not be possible now to get the children to the Ashram.
('50', 428, 1, 11, 707784) He has entrusted them [to somebody else].
('50', 428, 1, 12, 707826) Trust them to their fate now.
('50', 428, 1, 13, 707856) I am going on quite well at present.
('50', 428, 1, 14, 707893) I have gained a pound or a pound and a half in weight this week.
('50', 428, 1, 15, 707958) I cannot say that I have at last succeeded in giving up dates and raisins.
('50', 428, 1, 16, 708033) Only a few days ago, Jamnabehn and Vithaldas sent some dates and I ate them for two or three days.
('50', 428, 1, 17, 708132) And now again I have stopped eating them.
('50', 428, 1, 18, 708174) I am thus observing the effect of eating them and not eating them.
('50', 428, 1, 19, 708241) I do want to give them up if I can.
('50', 428, 1, 20, 708277) At present, therefore, my diet includes a little quantity of greens or cabbage or beetroot or turnip or pumpkin, bhakhari of bajra or jowar, four tolas of almonds, and lemon.
('50', 428, 1, 21, 708452) If God keeps me fit with these, so far so good; otherwise I will humbly resume milk or curds.
('50', 428, 1, 22, 708546) I cannot say yet that I am able to live on this diet.
('50', 428, 1, 23, 708600) I will not say, either, that I shall not be able to do so.
('50', 428, 1, 24, 708659) I had never expected that I would be able to digest jowar and bajra.
('50', 428, 1, 25, 708728) At present, however, I seem to have no difficulty in doing so.
('50', 428, 1, 26, 708791) I have noted what you say about yourself.
('50', 428, 1, 27, 708833) Your selection of the items and their quantities is correct.
('50', 428, 1, 28, 708894) I see that you have given up ground nuts; there is nothing wrong in that.
('50', 428, 1, 29, 708968) The fact that you are losing weight will do you no harm at all.
('50', 428, 1, 30, 709032) You should not lose strength, however.
('50', 428, 1, 31, 709071) If you find it necessary, increase the quantity of milk or curds.
('50', 428, 1, 32, 709137) It will per haps help you if you add just one tola of almonds to your diet.
('50', 428, 1, 33, 709213) Solve the problem of Parnerkar firmly.
('50', 428, 1, 34, 709252) It seems to have turned out a painful chapter.
('50', 428, 1, 35, 709299) I got the chapters of Gitabodh.
('50', 428, 1, 36, 709331) So far I have not received the piece of leather.
('50', 428, 1, 37, 709380) You may extract from any of my letters what I say about the yajna of spinning and publish it.
('50', 428, 1, 38, 709474) There is no harm in publising similar other material of public interest.
('50', 428, 1, 39, 709547) The more the people do yajna for self purification, the better.
('50', 428, 1, 40, 709611) A mass yajna has an altogether
('50', 429, 0, 1, 709642) 430 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 429, 1, 2, 709684) miraculous effect.
('50', 429, 1, 3, 709703) If you can, keep up with what you have started.
('50', 429, 1, 4, 709751) The spinning wheels and all other things must be in perfect condition.
('50', 429, 1, 5, 709822) These things produce an effect on our minds and make a difference to the speed.
('50', 429, 1, 6, 709902) Your speed has increased well enough.
('50', 429, 1, 7, 709940) I have not been able to go beyond 200 on the spinning wheel and 60 on the talki.
('50', 429, 1, 8, 710021) But I do hope to do so.
('50', 429, 1, 9, 710045) I do not know if there is something wrong with my fingers.
('50', 429, 1, 10, 710104) If the nerves running through them are weak, it is possible that they may not be active enough.
('50', 429, 1, 11, 710200) Just as you go to bed early, it will also be good if you make it a rule not to rise earlier than a fixed hour.
('50', 429, 1, 12, 710311) You should do what you can between 4 and 9 and then stop.
('50', 429, 1, 13, 710369) If you have more things to do than you can finish during that time, you may omit those which you safely can.
('50', 429, 1, 14, 710478) You should entrust to others the things which they can attend to.
('50', 429, 1, 15, 710544) It is really not necessary to give you advice in this matter, but I have said something all the same in order that you may be more careful.
('50', 429, 1, 16, 710684) One test of non attachment is that a person who is non attached always feels as if he had no work, though he is never inactive even for a single moment.
('50', 429, 1, 17, 710837) At present, however, that state of mind is a wish beyond our reach.
('50', 429, 1, 18, 710905) All the same, we should grasp with our intellect the meaning of that verse and, having done so, strive to reach that state.
('50', 429, 1, 19, 711029) The condition of a non attached person should never seem pitiable.
('50', 429, 1, 20, 711096) He should never have an expression on his face which might make anybody feel sorry for him and think that he was carrying an excessive burden of work.
('50', 429, 1, 21, 711247) Think what burden of work God has to carry.
('50', 429, 1, 22, 711291) Nevertheless He is the king of those who do not work.
('50', 429, 1, 23, 711345) He is an object of pity to no one.
('50', 429, 1, 24, 711380) On the contrary, we hunger for His mercy.
('50', 429, 1, 25, 711422) We should never be satisfied with a state a whit inferior to His, though He may carry the burden of the entire universe and we that of something smaller than even a particle of dust.
('50', 429, 1, 26, 711605) Just as He ever feels light, though carrying the burden of the universe, so should we do though carrying the burden of a mere fraction of a particle of dust.
('50', 429, 1, 27, 711763) We can easily attain such a state of mind if we reduce ourselves to a cipher.
('50', 429, 1, 28, 711841) Mirabehn finds it impossible to become non attached, but she is a good woman and, therefore, will one day approach that state.
('50', 429, 1, 29, 711968) From here I think she would do well not to undertake the responsibility of a new paper.
('50', 429, 1, 30, 712056) I had understood about Sitla Sahay even without a letter from him, and that is why I wished to get one from him.
('50', 429, 1, 31, 712169) I do not like to give to anyone the impression of my palm.
('50', 429, 1, 32, 712228) Apart from that, it would be against jail rules to do so.
('50', 429, 1, 33, 712286) I have, therefore, no choice in the matter.
('50', 429, 1, 34, 712330) Kakasaheb could not even give his signature on his photograph.

('50', 430, 1, 10, 712975) He did not succeed in producing that impression on me, and ultimately confessed having been guilty of a serious lapse.
('50', 430, 1, 11, 713094) I would not be surprised if a similar thing should happen in .

('50', 430, 1, 14, 713243) Look into this.
('50', 430, 1, 15, 713259) Kusum has referred in her letter to the problem that has arisen about the offer of a job to her in Porbandar.
('50', 430, 1, 16, 713369) Read my reply to her and guide her as you think best.
('50', 430, 1, 17, 713423) My compliments to Jaya for having gone to the rest house 5. Has she any relation there to whom I can write?
('50', 430, 1, 18, 713531) If Kakasaheb has not been able to win over the others, I think it would be best to let the Gita recitation go on as at present.
('50', 430, 1, 19, 713659) The suggestion to complete the whole recitation in seven days by reciting some verses in the morning and some in the evening has not appealed to me.
('50', 430, 1, 20, 713808) I will congratulate ourselves if we can improve upon the present practice.
('50', 430, 1, 21, 713883) I have noted that you took two and three quarter hours to write your letter to me.
('50', 430, 1, 22, 713966) The time taken in dispatching the letters must have been in addition to this.
('50', 430, 1, 23, 714044) It is fine indeed if you can get all this time.
('50', 430, 1, 24, 714092) If you can reduce it a little, however, you should certainly do so.
('50', 430, 1, 25, 714160) I see that I made an amusing mistake about Vidyabehn 6. I will be more careful in future when several persons claim the same name.
('50', 430, 1, 26, 714291) I think you did right in detaining Bhagwanjibhais 7 Manibehn.
('50', 430, 1, 27, 714353) She will be welcome to the Ashram when the two reach a level so that they feel as brother and sister to each other.
('50', 430, 1, 28, 714469) At present it is best that they remain away from each other.

('50', 431, 8, 26, 716015) If the R.T.C. results in doing something worthy of the great sacrifice of the nation and therefore of acceptance, I should be delighted.

('50', 432, 1, 2, 716425) The question of debts is incredibly simple.
('50', 432, 1, 3, 716469) The Lahore resolution has an explicit condition about reference to an impartial tribunal.
('50', 432, 1, 4, 716559) 1 But you have my assurance that no Congressman has ever enunciated the doctrine of total repudiation.
('50', 432, 1, 5, 716662) What Congressmen, including myself, demand is that the nations representatives should have the right of having any portion of the so called national debt, concessions and the like, being referred to an independent tribunal whose decision should be final and binding on both the parties.
('50', 432, 1, 6, 716949) I feel I am quite safe in saying this even for Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('50', 432, 1, 7, 717021) Not to adopt the course above indicated would be disloyal to the nation as total repudiation without just cause would undoubtedly be disho nourable.

('50', 436, 7, 15, 723261) December 28, 1930
('50', 436, 8, 16, 723279) PREMA, I do not want you to bind yourself with a promise.
('50', 436, 8, 17, 723337) I am satisfied with your assurance.
('50', 436, 8, 18, 723373) Do not shout so loudly as to harm your throat.
('50', 436, 8, 19, 723420) Did the fast have any beneficial effect on it?
('50', 436, 8, 20, 723467) I should like somebody to go through the letters which the children write to me from the point of view of both language and handwriting.

('50', 436, 13, 25, 723723) BHAGWANJI, You have not wasted your time in shortening your long letter.
('50', 436, 13, 26, 723796) This practice will ultimately make your thinking clear.
('50', 436, 13, 27, 723852) And as our thinking becomes clearer we are able to express in a few words whatever we have to say.
('50', 436, 13, 28, 723951) Quest for exploring the soul is nothing but our detecting, in the process, attachment, hatred, etc., lurking in our

('50', 437, 6, 7, 724364) KANTA, I got both your letters together.
('50', 437, 6, 8, 724405) You have done well to return to the Ashram.
('50', 437, 6, 9, 724449) Go back only when you have fully recovered.
('50', 437, 6, 10, 724493) If you drink hot water with salt, it will relieve the cough.
('50', 437, 6, 11, 724554) Take deep breaths.
('50', 437, 6, 12, 724573) You must breathe only through the nose.
('50', 437, 6, 13, 724613) Though you do not likeonions, can you not eat them as medicine?
('50', 437, 6, 14, 724677) Onions boiled in water should not smell.
('50', 437, 6, 15, 724718) Do not eat oily foods.
('50', 437, 6, 16, 724741) Rotlo and salt will be enough.
('50', 437, 6, 17, 724772) Drink plenty of boiled water with it.
('50', 437, 6, 18, 724810) You may take milk and ghee whenever offered.
('50', 437, 6, 19, 724855) You should keep soda handy and use it when you are offered buttermilk.

('50', 437, 11, 26, 725091) KUSUM (SENIOR), It would be very good if Shanta spends some time with you.
('50', 437, 11, 27, 725166) If I know what you wish in regard to punishment, I can consider and suggest something.
('50', 437, 11, 28, 725253) A fast may contain an element of violence in it.
('50', 437, 11, 29, 725302) If it is likely to take the form of blackmail, it should be avoided.
('50', 437, 11, 30, 725371) I do not remember if you had asked this question before.
('50', 437, 11, 31, 725428) Has not Shankarbhais passing away increased your responsibility?
('50', 437, 11, 32, 725493) Has the widow any children?
('50', 437, 11, 33, 725521) Is she educated?
('50', 437, 11, 34, 725538) Apart from that, was there any other responsibility on Shankarbhai?

('50', 438, 6, 10, 725961) They will acquire, in the process, some education in letters too.
('50', 438, 6, 11, 726027) But I need not write about this, since you are already discussing the matter with Kaka.
('50', 438, 6, 12, 726115) It is very necessary to keep the people and children occupied in useful activities.

('50', 438, 12, 24, 726649) Words of love need no more ornament than love itself does, no matter how foolish they are or how like the mere prattle of a child.
('50', 438, 12, 25, 726780) You are quite right in comparing with music an operation by skilled doctors.

('50', 438, 12, 27, 726956) We must now think of some punishment for Father.

('50', 439, 6, 10, 727518) You have piled up a fairly big heap of facts before me.
('50', 439, 6, 11, 727574) It requires a special art to deal with Mithubehn 1. Use all the art you have.
('50', 439, 6, 12, 727652) I have received complaints against her from the women too.
('50', 439, 6, 13, 727711) In any case, Time is the friend of all.
('50', 439, 6, 14, 727751) He sets everything right.
('50', 439, 6, 15, 727777) Probably that is why in English they call Him Father Time.
('50', 439, 6, 16, 727836) We believe Him to be God Himself.

('50', 440, 3, 5, 728628) I cannot guide you from here in detail.
('50', 440, 3, 6, 728668) Is it not our principle that a prisoner should not take interest in problems outside nor guide anyone?
('50', 440, 3, 7, 728771) I have merely drawn your attention to the principle which we have accepted.
('50', 440, 3, 8, 728847) Think over it and then unhesita tingly follow what seems to you your dharma.
('50', 440, 3, 9, 728924) If you cannot decide where your dharma lies, you may consult Pannalal or Narandas.
('50', 440, 3, 10, 729007) Now Kakasaheb also is there.
('50', 440, 3, 11, 729036) Discuss the matter with him and then do what you conscience tells you.

('50', 440, 9, 20, 729343) I got your letter.
('50', 440, 9, 21, 729362) I fully approve of what you did about Shantas husband.
('50', 440, 9, 22, 729417) It is enough if Shanta keeps up her courage.
('50', 440, 9, 23, 729462) Whatever happens, Shanta should refuse to go to him.
('50', 440, 9, 24, 729515) Let him, if he wishes, come again to attack her.
('50', 440, 9, 25, 729564) She should resist if he comes to carry her away by force.
('50', 440, 9, 26, 729622) She should not be alone at any time.
('50', 440, 9, 27, 729659) You need not take the trouble to find out where the man has gone.
('50', 440, 9, 28, 729725) It is enough that you have written about it to his people at home.
('50', 440, 9, 29, 729792) Be vigilant lest he come stealthily and attack her again.
('50', 440, 9, 30, 729850) If Mother is of the same mind as you in this matter, you will meet with no difficulty in following the course which you have adopted.
('50', 440, 9, 31, 729984) I have already replied to the question regarding marriage.
('50', 440, 9, 32, 730043) I see that it is not enough, and also that it is.
('50', 440, 9, 33, 730093) I have only pointed out the Vedic ideal modified to suit modern times.
('50', 440, 9, 34, 730164) If one is unable to follow it, one may modify it further as much as necessary.
('50', 440, 9, 35, 730243) It is not for me to take measure of anyones inability in this regard.

('50', 441, 1, 2, 730355) I dont mind your having written about Gangabehn.
('50', 441, 1, 3, 730404) She is not intentionally partial to anyone.
('50', 441, 1, 4, 730448) She may act in that manner through haste and lack of understanding.
('50', 441, 1, 5, 730516) However, she is the fittest to be the womens leader.
('50', 441, 1, 6, 730569) For Kalavati and others, therefore, service lies in doing as she says, and they ought to be satisfied with that.
('50', 441, 1, 7, 730682) They should not lose heart if people give no co operation in the work regarding cleanliness, khadi, etc.
('50', 441, 1, 8, 730787) In the long run people are bound to yield to love and their daily experience of other peoples conduct.
('50', 441, 1, 9, 730890) Their presence by itself is enough in such places, provided they spend the whole day in work.
('50', 441, 1, 10, 730984) And they must carry the takli and the spinning wheel with them.
('50', 441, 1, 11, 731048) They should also clean peoples latrines, etc.

('50', 441, 6, 16, 731212) BHAGWANJI, I have your letter.
('50', 441, 6, 17, 731243) If you regarded the world as unreal, i.e., transitory, does it in any way go contrary to reason?
('50', 441, 6, 18, 731340) Whatever is transitory is unreal because it does not endure for ever.
('50', 441, 6, 19, 731410) And there is no question of being attached to what is transient.
('50', 441, 6, 20, 731475) After all you will seldom find reason being exercised in matters of faith.
('50', 441, 6, 21, 731550) If it could be grasped by reason it ceases to be a matter of faith.
('50', 441, 6, 22, 731618) Faith might indeed one day lead to experience.

('50', 442, 1, 2, 732077) about my post.
('50', 442, 1, 3, 732092) That is why you got my packet on Thursday.
('50', 442, 1, 4, 732135) I got the piece of leather for sandals.
('50', 442, 1, 5, 732175) I see Mahadevs name in your list, but I did not find his letter.
('50', 442, 1, 6, 732240) Perhaps there was a letter by Durga, but I do not find even that.
('50', 442, 1, 7, 732306) I did feel that Ratilal would return.
('50', 442, 1, 8, 732344) Where had he gone on his pleasure trip?
('50', 442, 1, 9, 732384) Send with a visitor some time a sample of the bread which you make there.
('50', 442, 1, 10, 732458) We do not know when Giriraj will see reason.
('50', 442, 1, 11, 732503) Go on doing your best.
('50', 442, 1, 12, 732526) His heart is pure and he is filled with the spirit of self sacrifice.
('50', 442, 1, 13, 732596) One day, therefore, he is bound to see reason.
('50', 442, 1, 14, 732643) No one seeking to do good ever comes to harm. 1
('50', 442, 2, 15, 732691) I understand everyone being nervous about my experience in diet, for I have not fully succeeded in it.
('50', 442, 2, 16, 732794) But perhaps you may tell people that you know that I wake up in time and make necessary changes, and that my body responds to them.
('50', 442, 2, 17, 732926) How can I give up a dharma which has come to me unsought?
('50', 442, 2, 18, 732984) I was weighed yesterday and again seemed to have gained a pound and a half.
('50', 442, 2, 19, 733060) I advisedly say seemed because on the previous occasion I was weighed after I had passed stool and this time before I had done so.
('50', 442, 2, 20, 733191) The weight of the stool is not real gain in weight, but an unnecessary load.
('50', 442, 2, 21, 733268) We may therefore count half a pound less; even then there has been a gain of one pound.
('50', 442, 2, 22, 733356) But more important than the weight is the energy which I feel in my body.
('50', 442, 2, 23, 733430) I feel no sign of weakness yet.
('50', 442, 2, 24, 733462) I eat without difficulty one bhakhari of the size which they make here, half a piece at one meal.
('50', 442, 2, 25, 733560) The quantity of almonds which I eat comes to nearly two ounces.
('50', 442, 2, 26, 733624) At present at any rate I feel that, if I can continue to digest this amount of food, I shall be able to keep up my strength.There is, therefore, no reason at all for worry.
('50', 442, 2, 27, 733797) I am taking the utmost care, and, after all, even in this matter one needs to practise non attachment.
('50', 442, 2, 28, 733900) Who can say when that thing, more fragile than glass, will slip from ones hand and break?
('50', 442, 2, 29, 733990) I suppose you remember that you sent to Kantu 2 a diary made of handmade paper.
('50', 442, 2, 30, 734070) He has now sent it for my autograph.
('50', 442, 2, 31, 734107) The binding is very bad.
('50', 442, 2, 32, 734132) Not only that there is no neatness about it, but he has so bound it that one cannot turn the pages at all.
('50', 442, 2, 33, 734239) The art of binding books is easy to learn.
('50', 442, 2, 34, 734282) It can be learnt in a very short time.
('50', 442, 2, 35, 734321) Someone from among us should learn it.
('50', 442, 2, 36, 734360) Or we should get our binding done outside.
('50', 442, 2, 37, 734403) I intend to get the diary re bound in the press here.
('50', 442, 2, 38, 734457) This is just by the way.
('50', 442, 2, 39, 734482) I have mentioned the matter for future

('50', 443, 1, 2, 734652) guidance.
('50', 443, 1, 3, 734662) Yoga is skill in work. 1 This should be illustrated even in our least important activities.
('50', 443, 1, 4, 734754) Skill in work lies also in not attempting what we cannot do.
('50', 443, 1, 5, 734815) That is a case of action in inaction.
('50', 443, 1, 6, 734853) Even refraining from something is a form of action.
('50', 443, 1, 7, 734905) There is a saying in English borrowed from Persian.
('50', 443, 1, 8, 734957) He who knows that he knows not is wise. I am prompted to say all this form my own unhappy experience.
('50', 443, 1, 9, 735059) I observe that my spinning displays too much evidence of lack of skill and slackness despite all the care that I take.
('50', 443, 1, 10, 735178) There may be a knot in the thread which I observe, but I let it go.
('50', 443, 1, 11, 735246) At times the yarn is much too loose, but I let it remain.
('50', 443, 1, 12, 735304) I have acquired no proficiency at all in joining broken thread.
('50', 443, 1, 13, 735368) But I go on, all the same.
('50', 443, 1, 14, 735395) What kind of yajna is this?
('50', 443, 1, 15, 735423) Whether you call it carelessness, laxity or indifference, I observe every day this weakness in me in regard to this great yajna of spinning.
('50', 443, 1, 16, 735564) I try every day to improve myself, and fail.
('50', 443, 1, 17, 735609) But I keep hoping that one day I shall do well in my yajna.
('50', 443, 1, 18, 735669) Even if I do not, I derive consolation from the verse : After man lives, the enlightened one attains Me 2. It is a dangerous verse.
('50', 443, 1, 19, 735801) One may use it to remain content with ones lethargy.
('50', 443, 1, 20, 735854) If a person pays attention to the meaning of every word in it, he will not fall, otherwise the verse can be the cause of much harm to one.
('50', 443, 1, 21, 735993) I hear the bugle sounded every day at 5.30. It is now time for me to pace up and down.
('50', 443, 1, 22, 736080) 7.30, Tuesday If you send your packet by unregistered parcel, it may per haps be delayed.
('50', 443, 1, 23, 736170) Make inquiries, however, and do what you think best.
('50', 443, 1, 24, 736223) This time I have been hard pressed for time to cope with the work.
('50', 443, 1, 25, 736290) Ordinarily, I should be spinning at this hour.
('50', 443, 1, 26, 736337) I get letters from Prabhavati from time to time.
('50', 443, 1, 27, 736386) She should arrive in the Ashram any day now.
('50', 443, 1, 28, 736431) Drop me a postcard as soon as she arrives.
('50', 443, 1, 29, 736474) Most probably I shall get it.
('50', 443, 1, 30, 736504) Read my letters to Kaka and Mirabehn.
('50', 443, 1, 31, 736542) Today I stop here.
('50', 443, 2, 32, 736561) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Did you read the account about Amidas?
('50', 443, 2, 33, 736626) If you have not read it, get a copy from Harivallabhdas.
('50', 443, 2, 34, 736683) He seems to have preserved one.

('50', 444, 2, 3, 736989) December 29/30, 1930
('50', 444, 3, 4, 737010) MIRA, Your letter.
('50', 444, 3, 5, 737029) This time I must be very brief as the post came two days late.
('50', 444, 3, 6, 737092) I start therefore with the translation of the 2nd verse 1: In the early morning I worship Him who is beyond the reach of thought and speech yet by whose grace all speech is possible.
('50', 444, 3, 7, 737275) I worship Him whom the Vedas describe as neti, neti (not this).
('50', 444, 3, 8, 737339) Him they (the sages) have called God of gods, the unborn, the unfallen, the source of all. I do not think that this calls for any explanation.
('50', 444, 3, 9, 737482) The translation of the preface 2 is proceeding apace.
('50', 444, 3, 10, 737536) And as there was no Ashram post till Friday, I devoted the spare time to translating more paras.
('50', 444, 3, 11, 737633) The result is that now there are only 10 more left.
('50', 444, 3, 12, 737685) It will be time then to consider whether I can translate the Gita notes I am writing for the Ashram inmates.
('50', 444, 3, 13, 737794) Just now the 100 rounds on the takli take up much time.
('50', 444, 3, 14, 737850) But I am now showing an increase in speed.
('50', 444, 3, 15, 737893) The speed on the Gandiv today was for me quite a record, i.e., 169 rounds in 40 minutes.
('50', 444, 3, 16, 737982) This means 255 in 60 minutes.
('50', 444, 3, 17, 738012) The improvements are primarily responsible for this speed.
('50', 444, 3, 18, 738071) If I continue to show improvement, I may have some more time for writing work.
('50', 444, 3, 19, 738150) For I do not want to be greedy just now in the way of increase in the output.
('50', 444, 3, 20, 738228) I shall stick to 300 on the wheel and 100 on the takli till I show a permanently marked increase in speed.
('50', 444, 3, 21, 738335) I was quite sure you would get your foreign mail.
('50', 444, 3, 22, 738385) Of my health which is excellent more in the general letter.
('50', 444, 3, 23, 738445) Of your journalistic venture my opinion remains unaltered and is reinforced by the recent ordinance.
('50', 444, 3, 24, 738546) But, as I have said, my opinion ought not to count one way or the other.

('50', 445, 3, 4, 738902) SHANTA (SHANKARBHAI), I have your letter.
('50', 445, 3, 5, 738944) Let me give my blessings just now for the new year.
('50', 445, 3, 6, 738996) If you take a vow, do so after full deliberation and, having taken one be firm in keeping it.
('50', 445, 3, 7, 739090) There is no need at all to undertake a seven days fast.
('50', 445, 3, 8, 739146) It is likely to prove too much for you.
('50', 445, 3, 9, 739186) It is enough if you fast on the birthday.
('50', 445, 3, 10, 739228) Write to Shankarbhai and to me and tell us what vow you take.
('50', 445, 3, 11, 739290) Take the vow in the presence of the girl friends living there.
('50', 445, 3, 12, 739353) If possible, spend that day with Kusumbehn.
('50', 445, 3, 13, 739397) It would be good before taking your vow to consult her.
('50', 445, 3, 14, 739453) The difficulty which you point out about eating food without spices is only an excuse.
('50', 445, 3, 15, 739540) One who is determined to eat unspiced food will certainly find out what to eat.
('50', 445, 3, 16, 739620) Surely, there are no chillies in rotla, rice and buttermilk.
('50', 445, 3, 17, 739681) [Is it not so?] One should be satisfied with a rotla, buttermilk and salt.
('50', 445, 3, 18, 739756) Just as we eat and drink every day, we should also write the diary every day.
('50', 445, 3, 19, 739834) Everything can be done if one has the will.
('50', 445, 3, 20, 739878) Kamu has not acknowledge my letter.
('50', 445, 3, 21, 739914) Ask her whether she got it.
('50', 445, 3, 22, 739942) What will her husband do at Ahmedabad?
('50', 445, 3, 23, 739981) How can anyone say that there is no sin in killing bugs and fleas?
('50', 445, 3, 24, 740048) Even in cutting up vegetables there is sin.
('50', 445, 3, 25, 740092) However, we do commit some sins which we regard as unavoidable.
('50', 445, 3, 26, 740156) When we smoke a place to protect ourselves against fleas, countless fleas are killed, but we feel helpless and do that all the same.
('50', 445, 3, 27, 740289) However, we realize through such necessities that it is everyones duty to seek deliverance from bodily life.

('50', 446, 1, 4, 740799) I am confirmed in my opinion after reading Hari ichchhas letter.
('50', 446, 1, 5, 740864) But what happened has happened.
('50', 446, 1, 6, 740896) I have written to Hari ichchha and explained to her how she can now make the best of an unfortunate event.
('50', 446, 1, 7, 741003) 1 She will probably show you that letter if you have not seen it already.
('50', 446, 1, 8, 741077) Ask her to show it to you.
('50', 446, 1, 9, 741104) Your duty now is to cling to the job which you have accepted.
('50', 446, 1, 10, 741166) You may think of something else to do only when circumstances arise in which you on your own leave itfor I have already observed your unsettled state of mind.
('50', 446, 1, 11, 741325) I have faith in you despite that, for you belong to Valjis family and are sincere at heart.

('50', 446, 5, 21, 741768) However, I continue my efforts to see that I get my letters immediately.
('50', 446, 5, 22, 741841) When will you now go to the Ashram?
('50', 446, 5, 23, 741877) I should like you to do so without delay.
('50', 446, 5, 24, 741919) Your weakness must disappear.
('50', 446, 5, 25, 741949) Dont be eager to start wroking as soon as you reach the Ashram.
('50', 446, 5, 26, 742013) Take milk, curds and furits in sufficient quantities.
('50', 446, 5, 27, 742067) And you of course know the benefits of open air.
('50', 446, 5, 28, 742116) May God protect you in every way.
('50', 446, 5, 29, 742150) Dont worry about me.
('50', 446, 5, 30, 742171) I had given up eating fresh fruits during the [Dandi] march itself.

('50', 447, 3, 4, 742595) PRABHUDAS, For want of time, only this much now.
('50', 447, 3, 5, 742644) I have understood your problem with the takli.
('50', 447, 3, 6, 742691) Do you have that problem with the bamboo one or the iron takli?
('50', 447, 3, 7, 742755) Your faith will produce the right means even in material things for you.
('50', 447, 3, 8, 742828) Hence, be patient.
('50', 447, 3, 9, 742847) For the present, keep a watch on how much yarn the Magan spinning wheel, in its existing form, gives.
('50', 447, 3, 10, 742949) You should not have any problem when a devotee of the Magan spinning wheel, i.e.
('50', 447, 3, 11, 743030) Dhiru, is with you.
('50', 447, 3, 12, 743050) If the takli has started giving 330 rounds of yarn per hour, why cannot the Magan wheel give 3330 rounds per hour?
('50', 447, 3, 13, 743165) Do not be alarmed by it.
('50', 447, 3, 14, 743190) Initially, the takli gave only 30 rounds, now it easily gives ten times more.
('50', 447, 3, 15, 743268) It is not impossible to produce on Magan wheel ten times more than the takli.

('50', 447, 8, 21, 743480) But I put off writing to you thinking that you will soon be in the Ashram.
('50', 447, 8, 22, 743555) The more you stay on there, the more I feel worried.
('50', 447, 8, 23, 743608) Why dont you go away immediately and leave matters to take care of themselves?
('50', 447, 8, 24, 743687) If Jayaprakash cannot go immediately, cannot he ask Harasubabu?
('50', 447, 8, 25, 743751) I see that the longer you delay in going to the Ashram, the weaker you are becoming.
('50', 447, 8, 26, 743836) What further can I now write even to Jayaprakash?
('50', 447, 8, 27, 743886) What is your diet in your present condition of health?
('50', 447, 8, 28, 743941) Who watches over you when you are in a swoon?
('50', 447, 8, 29, 743987) What did Father tell you when you met him?
('50', 447, 8, 30, 744030) I feel afraid even to ask you questions, for it may be a burden on your mind to think and reply to them.
('50', 447, 8, 31, 744135) I dismiss my worries in the faith that God has been protecting you and will continue to do so.

('50', 448, 2, 3, 744371) YERAVDA MANDIR, December 31, 1930
('50', 448, 3, 4, 744405) CHI., It is possible that, from an academic standpoint, my interpretation of the phrase 
('50', 448, 4, 5, 744494) <image: None, width: 15, height: 12, bpc: 1>
('50', 448, 5, 6, 744539) <image: None, width: 18, height: 12, bpc: 1>
('50', 448, 6, 7, 744584) <image: None, width: 24, height: 12, bpc: 1>
('50', 448, 7, 8, 744629) <image: None, width: 9, height: 12, bpc: 1>
('50', 448, 8, 9, 744673) is of no value.
('50', 448, 8, 10, 744689) But I think it is possible to interpret it to refer both to the self and the body.
('50', 448, 8, 11, 744772) The self unclouded by ignorance knows neither birth nor death.
('50', 448, 8, 12, 744835) However, one who believes that it dies must believe also that it is born again.
('50', 448, 8, 13, 744915) For, nothing in this world suffers total destruction, not even physical body.
('50', 448, 8, 14, 744993) It ceases to exist in one form and takes another.
('50', 448, 8, 15, 745043) It goes on ever changing its form.
('50', 448, 8, 16, 745078) After the body has been reduced to ashes it will not remain unchanged for ever in the form of atoms, for the atoms will change too.
('50', 448, 8, 17, 745210) When turned into ornaments, gold acquires different names and forms but it, ever remains gold. Does this appeal to your reason in any way?
('50', 448, 8, 18, 745349) As Vinobas style is very lively, he wins our interest.
('50', 448, 8, 19, 745404) However, I have come to the conclusion that it is possible to put more than one interpretation on the words of the Gita and that all of them may be right.
('50', 448, 8, 20, 745559) The central meaning would remain the same, and consistent with it there may be as many interpretations as one may wish, which together, like the numerous instruments in an orchestra, produce a beautiful symphony.
('50', 448, 8, 21, 745772) As regards is seated, sits and walks, it is possible to draw out three distinct meaning.
('50', 448, 8, 22, 745861) But the Gita is not a technical or scientific work composed with such precision.
('50', 448, 8, 23, 745942) It abounds in repetitions, and there is looseness of expression too.
('50', 448, 8, 24, 746011) This is not a defect, but it is there.
('50', 448, 8, 25, 746050) These days I have been spinning on the takli at least 100 rounds a day.
('50', 448, 8, 26, 746122) I have given up the iron takli, after having tried very hard to spin well on it, and now I am back to the bamboo takli.
('50', 448, 8, 27, 746242) I feel a little better with it.
('50', 448, 8, 28, 746274) The speed has risen to 75 per hour.
('50', 448, 8, 29, 746310) It will go up still.
('50', 448, 8, 30, 746331) After I have mastered the bamboo takli fully, I will return to the iron one.

('50', 449, 2, 3, 746559) [December 1930] 1
('50', 449, 3, 4, 746577) BHAGWANJI, You have construed the answers to your questions all right.
('50', 449, 3, 5, 746648) Even then I will add a little here.
('50', 449, 3, 6, 746684) There is no end to conflicts of loyalties and to miseries.
('50', 449, 3, 7, 746743) True desire for knowledge arises from this.
('50', 449, 3, 8, 746787) The body can be said to be an abode of punya 2 in spite of its origin in papa 3 in so far as it is a means to realization of the atman.
('50', 449, 3, 9, 746923) Knowledge means the realization of the self.
('50', 449, 3, 10, 746968) One who has fully realized truth and non violence is a perfect jnani in spite of being unlettered.
('50', 449, 3, 11, 747067) This includes the answer to the question why we should obtain, etc.
('50', 449, 3, 12, 747135) Non attachment means absence of attachment.
('50', 449, 3, 13, 747179) Attachment means the desire for a certain fruit.
('50', 449, 3, 14, 747228) Attachment is implicit in wanting to climb the Himalayas.
('50', 449, 3, 15, 747286) Climbing the Himalayas when it falls to ones lot is doing it free of attachment.
('50', 449, 3, 16, 747367) Yoga : Action performed without attachment.
('50', 449, 3, 17, 747411) You write books but you do not crave for honour on that account, nor money nor praise from anyone.
('50', 449, 3, 18, 747510) And since it has been your lot to render service through writing what you do is yoga.
('50', 449, 3, 19, 747596) Generally I do not forbid asking questions.
('50', 449, 3, 20, 747640) But the better and correct way is to solve such problems by oneself and to consult others in case of doubt.
('50', 449, 3, 21, 747748) Unless we did it our discrimination will not develop.

('50', 451, 13, 20, 750114) BHAISHRI MANMOHANDAS, I got the pages of your booklet.
('50', 451, 13, 21, 750169) I have gone through them.
('50', 451, 13, 22, 750195) You have collected some useful statistics.
('50', 451, 13, 23, 750238) But the title of the booklet is certainly not appropriate.
('50', 451, 13, 24, 750297) It gives more and more reliable information about mill cloth than about handloom cloth.
('50', 451, 13, 25, 750385) After reading it, I felt that its title How to Compete with Foreign Cloth was too ambitious for the contents.
('50', 451, 13, 26, 750495) You have not attempted a careful and detailed examination of hand spinning.
('50', 451, 13, 27, 750571) If you have realized that the master key for the solution of the problem is hand spinning, you should put

('50', 452, 1, 3, 750907) If you are not convinced that it is so, you should not give it a place in your scheme yielding to the present atmosphere.
('50', 452, 1, 4, 751029) I am becoming more and more convinced that, without hand spinning, permanent boycott of foreign cloth will be impossible and that even hand weaving cannot survive without it.
('50', 452, 1, 5, 751204) If you share this view, you should explain it convincingly.
('50', 452, 1, 6, 751264) Despite my partiality for hand spinning, I dont think that Talchekars contention is supported by facts.
('50', 452, 1, 7, 751368) I have even had correspondence with him on the matter.
('50', 452, 1, 8, 751423) His claim that handspun yarn is superior is not borne out by experience.
('50', 452, 1, 9, 751496) By carefully co ordinating a variety of factors, it may be possible to produce hand spun yarn which would be stronger than mill yarn, but the ordinary hand spun yarn will always be weaker than mill yarn.
('50', 452, 1, 10, 751700) But what does it matter?
('50', 452, 1, 11, 751725) As compared to hand made bhakhari, the biscuit produced in a factory with the help of dies will always be perfectly round in shape, smooth and attractive in appearance, and still the former will continue to be preferred to it.
('50', 452, 1, 12, 751952) You have tried to convince the readers that mill cloth and handloom cloth can supplement each other.
('50', 452, 1, 13, 752053) It may be possible for some time to regulate things in that manner, but not permanently.
('50', 452, 1, 14, 752142) The division of the booklet into sections is not accurate.
('50', 452, 1, 15, 752201) Go through it again.

('50', 452, 5, 23, 752558) Probably the children dont know why the 23rd of December is the shortest day.
('50', 452, 5, 24, 752636) In trying to explain this, you will automatically explain to them some facts of geography and astronomy.
('50', 452, 5, 25, 752741) Will you not try this?
('50', 452, 5, 26, 752764) While explaining the reason for the 23rd being the shortest day, speak about the longest day and about the dates on which the day and the night are equal.
('50', 452, 5, 27, 752919) Simultaneously, you may explain the change of seasons.
('50', 452, 5, 28, 752974) While doing so tell them what Christmas means.

('50', 453, 1, 6, 753368) You, perhaps, know something of the subject.
('50', 453, 1, 7, 753413) If you do not, you can pick up some general knowledge without much trouble and impart it to children, and to me through letters.
('50', 453, 1, 8, 753542) You can teach as you learn.
('50', 453, 1, 9, 753570) But you should not feel this as a burden on your mind.
('50', 453, 1, 10, 753625) It will be a boon to the children and to me if you make some such effort.
('50', 453, 1, 11, 753699) I constantly feel that we dont give to children all that we ought to.
('50', 453, 1, 12, 753769) We should, therefore, give that at any rate which we can without much trouble to ourselves.

('50', 454, 3, 6, 755261) With all your faults and limitations, you should unreservedly offer your and Vidyas services to Father whenever he can accept them.

('50', 454, 8, 22, 756150) I hope you received my reply.
('50', 454, 8, 23, 756180) You have done well in confessing everything.
('50', 454, 8, 24, 756225) In my opinion, you should certainly not have physical relations with your wife.
('50', 454, 8, 25, 756305) You should make some arrangement for her education so that her intellect may develop.
('50', 454, 8, 26, 756391) If you are firm in your decision to have no physical relations with her, you should plainly tell her about that so that she may not remain discontented and may not go on hoping.
('50', 454, 8, 27, 756569) You should also let her marry again if she wishes to do so.
('50', 454, 8, 28, 756629) You should not do that if deep in your heart you crave for physical gratification.
('50', 454, 8, 29, 756712) In any case, you should make it clear to her that you cannot satisfy her as long as the present movement lasts.
('50', 454, 8, 30, 756824) Since she is poor, you should bear the burden of maintaining her.
('50', 454, 8, 31, 756890) You should ask her to go and live in the Ashram.

('50', 455, 6, 9, 757315) I should be happy if you change.

('50', 455, 11, 19, 757829) RAMABEHN, I understand your enthusiasm.
('50', 455, 11, 20, 757869) But the Gita tells us that, even if paradharma looks more attractive, swadharma is better for us.
('50', 455, 11, 21, 757967) 1 We may die while doing swadharma.
('50', 455, 11, 22, 758003) Somebody elses work is fraught with danger.
('50', 455, 11, 23, 758047) Swadharma means ones own work.
('50', 455, 11, 24, 758078) Your work is what Mithubehn may assign to you.
('50', 455, 11, 25, 758125) You and others who support you should reason with Mithubehn.
('50', 455, 11, 26, 758186) Till she is won over, you should keep patience.
('50', 455, 11, 27, 758234) You yourself say that you get something to learn every day.
('50', 455, 11, 28, 758294) Why then should you be impatient?
('50', 455, 11, 29, 758328) In any case, a prisoner has no right to say what work she will do and what work she will not do.

('50', 456, 5, 7, 758664) January 3, 1931
('50', 456, 6, 8, 758680) MIRA, I have read the two renderings you have sent me of the first verse of the morning prayer.
('50', 456, 6, 9, 758776) For use and perhaps conveying the meaning, I prefer my rendering.
('50', 456, 6, 10, 758842) If you find any obscurity anywhere, please tell me.
('50', 456, 6, 11, 758894) The second I sent you by the last mail.
('50', 456, 6, 12, 758934) 1 Here is the third.
('50', 456, 6, 13, 758955) In the early morning I bow to Him who is beyond darkness, who is like the sun, who is perfect, ancient, called Purushottam (the best among men) and in whom (through the veil of darkness) we fancy the whole universe as appearing even as (in darkness) we imagine a rope to be a snake. 2
('50', 456, 7, 14, 759240) The idea is that the universe is not real in the sense of being permanent, it is neither a thing to be hankered after nor feared because it is supposed to be Gods creation.
('50', 456, 7, 15, 759413) As a matter of fact, it is a creation of our imagination even as the snake in the rope is.
('50', 456, 7, 16, 759504) The real universe like the real rope is there.
('50', 456, 7, 17, 759551) We perceive either when the veil is lifted and darkness is gonecompare.
('50', 456, 7, 18, 759623) And with the morn, those angel faces smile which I have loved long since and lost awhile. The three verses go together and I think are Shankars composition.
('50', 456, 7, 19, 759780) You do know of Shankar, do you not?
('50', 456, 7, 20, 759816) Five more days and I shall have finished the translation of the preface.
('50', 456, 7, 21, 759889) My suggestion is that I continue to send you the verses and the bhajans with such comments as then occur to me.
('50', 456, 7, 22, 760001) You should for your own satisfaction, with the help of whoever comes your way, translate the weekly notes on the Gita.
('50', 456, 7, 23, 760120) The plan I am now following is well thought out, i.e., that of looking through the translation of the whole Gita in the light of my rendering and translating the notes.
('50', 456, 7, 24, 760289) The attempt may lead to

('50', 457, 1, 4, 760577) It would not be right.
('50', 457, 1, 5, 760600) Of my food experiment, you will learn everything from Narandas.
('50', 457, 1, 6, 760664) The assurance, that the moment I find it necessary I shall revart to milk, should remove all cause for anxiety.
('50', 457, 1, 7, 760776) By the travelling wheel I suppose, you mean the box wheel of the Pratishthan type.
('50', 457, 1, 8, 760859) Whatever it is, your speed is certainly quite good.
('50', 457, 1, 9, 760911) Let the Gandiv disappear from your mind unless Kaka has something to show.
('50', 457, 2, 10, 760986) I was sorry to learn about Romain Rollands health.
('50', 457, 2, 11, 761037) Do please send him my love and tell him I often think of him and pray that he may be long spared in the service of humanity.

('50', 457, 8, 17, 761299) He should let me know his wishes.
('50', 457, 8, 18, 761333) He could certainly go to the Ashram if he really wants to.
('50', 457, 8, 19, 761392) Who is now the Principal of Prem Mahavidyalaya?
('50', 457, 8, 20, 761440) Why has Devasharmaji 3 been transferred to Kanpur [jail]?

('50', 458, 3, 4, 761874) MOTI, If you wish to continue to be Moti 1 of Vijayanagar and not Motibehn in Vijayanagar, you must learn to make your hand writing as beautiful as pearls.
('50', 458, 3, 5, 762030) The handwriting in your letter was quite good, but you should improve it a little every day.
('50', 458, 3, 6, 762123) It is one of the virtues of a person devoted to dharma that he or she is exact in every matter, small or big.
('50', 458, 3, 7, 762233) Will no one in Cochin agree to keep Shantu exclusively on fruit?

('50', 458, 3, 11, 762443) If we do, the child will not live long.
('50', 458, 3, 12, 762483) It is easy to cure such diseases in childhood.
('50', 458, 3, 13, 762530) The alternative is for you to keep Shantu with you and bring him up yourself.
('50', 458, 3, 14, 762608) I am glad that you have taken up the task of keeping children clean.

('50', 458, 7, 20, 762931) How did that happen?
('50', 458, 7, 21, 762952) Describe to me your experiences in jail.

('50', 460, 5, 9, 765157) VASUMATI, I am writing this immediately after morning prayers.
('50', 460, 5, 10, 765220) Taste ultimately is a matter of the palate and the mind.
('50', 460, 5, 11, 765277) Our vow is that we will not gratify the craving of the palate.
('50', 460, 5, 12, 765340) The latter will always feel and recognize the taste of every food.
('50', 460, 5, 13, 765407) But to gratify the craving of the palate means to eat food which it likes and avoid food which it dislikes.
('50', 460, 5, 14, 765515) We may certainly eat whatever food the body requires, but only at the time when and in the quantity which the body requires, and it does not matter then if it gives us pleasure.
('50', 460, 5, 15, 765693) When Mahavir has conquered the palate, he will gladly accept what is for his good.
('50', 460, 5, 16, 765776) Ordinarily, a man does not care for his spiritual good and does what will give him pleasure for the time being even if that is likely to harm him spiritually.
('50', 460, 5, 17, 765935) Hence the attitude, that one should accept whatever is offered to one at any time, is not the right one for a spiritual seeker.
('50', 460, 5, 18, 766063) We do not know from experience how a person who has attained perfection acts, and need not concern ourselves with the question.
('50', 460, 5, 19, 766191) Let us wait till we have attained perfection.
('50', 460, 5, 20, 766237) The question then will not arise at all.
('50', 460, 5, 21, 766278) It this does not answer all your question, ask me again.
('50', 460, 5, 22, 766335) It is a good sign that we notice even our small defects.
('50', 460, 5, 23, 766392) We ought to know whether we are striving to overcome them.
('50', 460, 5, 24, 766451) If I see that I have pride in me and if I am a spiritual seeker, I am bound to make an effort to get rid of it.
('50', 460, 5, 25, 766563) I shall not feel easy in mind till I have got rid of it.
('50', 460, 5, 26, 766620) If there is a snake in the house, we shall not feel easy in mind till we have caught and removed it.
('50', 460, 5, 27, 766721) If asked, we can certainly say whether

('50', 461, 10, 22, 767817) Narandas has also written to me about you.
('50', 461, 10, 23, 767860) He says that you refused to show him your diary.
('50', 461, 10, 24, 767909) If this is true, your action was not right.
('50', 461, 10, 25, 767953) Narandas is an extremely straightforward man and always does what he thinks right.
('50', 461, 10, 26, 768036) You can tell him everything.
('50', 461, 10, 27, 768065) Have a quiet talk with him and, if there has been any misunderstanding, remove it.
('50', 461, 10, 28, 768148) If you wish to live in the Ashram and are not opposed to any of its rules, Narandas on his part will certainly take you back.
('50', 461, 10, 29, 768274) He has even written to me to say so.
('50', 461, 10, 30, 768311) Whether or not you live in the Ashram, you can keep up

('50', 462, 1, 4, 768584) Difference of opinion should not mean personal enmity.
('50', 462, 1, 5, 768639) If you think it necessary to engage a lawyer to defend your brother in law, you may do so.
('50', 462, 1, 6, 768730) If you have sufficient courage, however, do without a lawyer.
('50', 462, 1, 7, 768792) Your actions seem all right.
('50', 462, 1, 8, 768821) I did not understand your reason for refusing to sign the summons.
('50', 462, 1, 9, 768888) But that is a minor matter.
('50', 462, 1, 10, 768916) I have written to Shanta, Kalavati, Raghavdas and Banarsidas.
('50', 462, 1, 11, 768978) Read those letters.
('50', 462, 1, 12, 768998) You had asked the same, or a similar, question about art in your previous letter.

('50', 462, 1, 15, 769137) I got the booklet on vows.
('50', 462, 1, 16, 769164) I did not see any letter from Ramnarayan.

('50', 462, 1, 20, 769355) If, however, she cannot remain hungry and begs repeatedly for something to eat, you may give her a khakhara 3. If she can continue milk and light diet for some time longer still, she will become all right.
('50', 462, 1, 21, 769561) You should do everything with the utmost patience.
('50', 462, 1, 22, 769612) Dont feel unhappy about anything.
('50', 462, 1, 23, 769646) What God, World Teacher and Master has willed for the day, it is futile to grieve over.
('50', 462, 1, 24, 769734) Without His will we cannot move a blade of grass.
('50', 462, 1, 25, 769784) If we do fuss about things, what is left over is a legacy of sorrows. 4

('50', 462, 5, 29, 769979) DURGA, It is 7 oclock on Sunday morning just now.
('50', 462, 5, 30, 770029) It is extre mely cold.
('50', 462, 5, 31, 770052) The hands shake, but I cannot give myself a holiday from writing.
('50', 462, 5, 32, 770118) After I have finished this letter.
('50', 462, 5, 33, 770153) I will start the spinning yajna.
('50', 462, 5, 34, 770186) You have done well in starting the experiment of eating oranges.
('50', 462, 5, 35, 770251) While it continues, write to me regularly.
('50', 462, 5, 36, 770294) Tell me in detail the effect

('50', 463, 1, 2, 770482) which it has.
('50', 463, 1, 3, 770496) Weigh yourself from time to time.
('50', 463, 1, 4, 770530) Enemas will also have to be continued.
('50', 463, 1, 5, 770569) I suppose you take sun baths too.
('50', 463, 1, 6, 770603) If you have enough strength, you should slowly walk about a little.
('50', 463, 1, 7, 770671) Now for Mahadev : I dont hope at all to leave this place with any new discovery about the spinning wheel.
('50', 463, 1, 8, 770777) Along with enthusiasm, one must have knowledge of the craft, too, which I dont possess.
('50', 463, 1, 9, 770865) I shall be satisfied if I can make sufficient changes which will enable me to increase my speed.
('50', 463, 1, 10, 770962) I do feel that one can acquire good speed despite ones age.
('50', 463, 1, 11, 771022) If, however, the nerves of my hands have become weak, the speed will not increase.
('50', 463, 1, 12, 771105) But I do make changes from time to time to see if they help me to increase my speed.
('50', 463, 1, 13, 771190) I see that I displayed great wisdom in not going to England despite Sastris view that I should go.
('50', 463, 1, 14, 771289) Really speaking, it required no wisdom to come to that decision.
('50', 463, 1, 15, 771354) My heart simply did not consent, however much I tried to persuade myself.
('50', 463, 1, 16, 771428) The reins are held by that Master of the Play.
('50', 463, 1, 17, 771475) Why, then, need we worry at all?
('50', 463, 1, 18, 771508) On the contrary, we should daily leave the reins more and more in His hands and strengthen His hands.
('50', 463, 1, 19, 771610) If any trace of fissure is noticed, [he] should immediately take steps to cure it.
('50', 463, 1, 20, 771693) And [he] should not give up milk or ghee.
('50', 463, 1, 21, 771735) It is our duty to obtain whatever facilities we can get and which are essential for our health.
('50', 463, 1, 22, 771831) If we clearly see that we hold the body as a trust, that it is not our own, we shall think no more about the problem.
('50', 463, 1, 23, 771949) It is good that Devdas has been working at Sanskrit to increase his proficiency in it.
('50', 463, 1, 24, 772036) Mahadev will be able to help him in that.
('50', 463, 1, 25, 772078) My blessings to all prisoners.
('50', 463, 1, 26, 772109) Pyarelal spins daily 375 rounds on the spinning wheel and 100 on the takli, and the work takes up the whole of the morning and an hour and a half in the afternoon.

('50', 464, 1, 8, 772910) He had written a fairly long letter.

('50', 464, 11, 28, 773658) This must not happen.
('50', 464, 11, 29, 773680) Even if there is nothing worth writing it will do if you send a few words about your welfare.

('50', 465, 3, 5, 774082) One who recognizes his weakness and desires to remove it is already half way to success.
('50', 465, 3, 6, 774171) The resolve to devote the rest of your life to service is all to the good.
('50', 465, 3, 7, 774246) Derive greater strength from the calamity that has befallen you.

('50', 466, 8, 14, 775631) Generally they are quite regular now.
('50', 466, 8, 15, 775669) But I have not been very regular n writing to you thinking that you will now be leaving for the Ashram any day.
('50', 466, 8, 16, 775781) Of course I think of you every day.
('50', 466, 8, 17, 775817) I dont at all like your remaining there.
('50', 466, 8, 18, 775858) If Jayaprakash cannot leave just now, and if he wishes, someone from the Ashram will come to fetch you.
('50', 466, 8, 19, 775962) Since Kamala 1 has gone to the rest house, will you have to go to Prayag now?

('50', 467, 3, 7, 776467) After writing a letter, you should go through it once.

('50', 467, 8, 14, 776779) This time I got the post two days late.
('50', 467, 8, 15, 776819) You have got a good band of workers with you.
('50', 467, 8, 16, 776865) You should only think about the work and not feel worried about it.
('50', 467, 8, 17, 776933) Never doubt that you are doing Gods work, provided, of course, you do it in the spirit of yajna.

('50', 467, 8, 19, 777079) It is good.

('50', 467, 14, 25, 777288) I have your letter.
('50', 467, 14, 26, 777308) In my opinion, the view of Vivekananda and Dhurandhar is one sided.
('50', 467, 14, 27, 777376) One should feel in the heart what one says.
('50', 467, 14, 28, 777420) Surdas, Tulsidas and other bhaktas have described themselves as cunnings, lustful, etc.
('50', 467, 14, 29, 777508) In doing so, they were not merely using the
('50', 468, 0, 1, 777552) VOL 50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 469
('50', 468, 1, 2, 777597) language of modesty, but speaking from the heart.
('50', 468, 1, 3, 777647) The truth is that we feel both ways.
('50', 468, 1, 4, 777684) In an enlightened state, we know ourselves to be Brahman, but in the ignorant state we feel meek and humble before that Merciful One.
('50', 468, 1, 5, 777818) He who does not feel so but knows himself as the perfect Brahman may not sing bhajans praying for Gods mercy.
('50', 468, 1, 6, 777928) You will not come across one such person in millions.
('50', 468, 1, 7, 777982) To realize ones smallness is the beginning of being great.
('50', 468, 1, 8, 778041) The drop of sea water which has become separated from the sea would dry up if it thought that it was still the sea.
('50', 468, 1, 9, 778157) If it admitted to itself that it was no more than a drop, it would flow towards the sea, merge in it and become one with it.
('50', 468, 1, 10, 778282) Culture means refinement of feelings and education means knowledge of literature.
('50', 468, 1, 11, 778364) Education is a means and culture is the end.
('50', 468, 1, 12, 778409) The latter is possible even without education.
('50', 468, 1, 13, 778456) For instance, if a child is brought up in a truly cultured family, it will unconsciously imbibe culture from its environment.
('50', 468, 1, 14, 778582) In our country at any rate, present day education and culture have no connection with each other.
('50', 468, 1, 15, 778680) If the educated still retain some culture, that is in spite of their education.
('50', 468, 1, 16, 778760) This fact shows that the roots of our culture are deep.
('50', 468, 1, 17, 778816) My blessings and compliments to Prasannabehn.
('50', 468, 1, 18, 778862) I should like her to draw her husband also to the Ashram.
('50', 468, 1, 19, 778920) You seem to be running a competition in the opposite direction with Narandas with regard to weight.
('50', 468, 1, 20, 779020) It is good.
('50', 468, 1, 21, 779032) You can afford to put on some more weight, and Narandas to lose some.
('50', 468, 1, 22, 779102) I like the translation of Gitabodh which Dhurandhar is making.

('50', 469, 5, 6, 779372) DEAR SIR TEJ BAHADUR,
('50', 469, 6, 7, 779394) I have to thank you for informing me of the results of the conversations held by Mr. Jayakar and yourself with the Congress leaders now in prison and for sending me copies of their joint letter of the 15th August and of your reply thereto.
('50', 469, 6, 8, 779634) I should wish you and Mr. Jayakar both to know how great has been my appreciation of the spirit in which you have pursued your self imposed public spirited task of endeavouring to assist in the restoration of normal conditions in India.
('50', 469, 6, 9, 779871) It is worth recalling the conditions under which you entered upon your undertaking.
('50', 469, 6, 10, 779955) In my letter of 16th July I assured you that it was the earnest desire of myself, my Government and I had no doubt also of His Majesty's Government, to do everything we could to assist the people of India to obtain as large degree of management of their own affairs as could be shown to be consistent with the making of provision for those matters in regard to which they were not at present in a position to assumeresponsibility.
('50', 469, 6, 11, 780386) It would be among the functions of the Conference to examine in the light of all the material available what those matters might be and what provision might be made for them.
('50', 469, 6, 12, 780561) I had previously made two other points plain in my speech to the Legislature on the 9th July.
('50', 469, 6, 13, 780655) The first is that those attending the Conference would have the unfettered right of examining the whole constitutional problem in all its bearing.
('50', 469, 6, 14, 780802) Secondly, that any agreement at which the Conference was able to arrive would form the basis of the proposals which His Majesty's Government would later submit to Parliament.
('50', 469, 6, 15, 780977) I fear as you will no doubt recognize that the task you had voluntarily undertaken has not been assisted by the letter you have received from the Congress leaders.
('50', 469, 6, 16, 781141) In view both of the general tone by which that letter is inspired and of its contents, as also of its blank refusal to recognize the grave injury to which the country has been subjected by the Congress policy, not the least in the economic field, I do not think any useful purpose would be served by my attempting to deal in detail with the suggestions there made and I must frankly say I regard discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in the letter as impossible.
('50', 469, 6, 17, 781617) I hope if you desire to see the Congress leaders again you will make this plain.
('50', 469, 7, 18, 781698) There is one further comment I must make upon the last paragraph of your reply to them dated 16th August.
('50', 469, 7, 19, 781804) When we discussed these matters, I said if the Civil

('50', 470, 1, 2, 781962) Disobedience Movement was in fact abandoned, I should not desire to continue the Ordinances (apart from those connected with the Lahore Conspiracy Case and Chittagong) necessitated by the situation which EX HYPOTHESI would no longer exist.
('50', 470, 1, 3, 782202) But I was careful to make it plain that I was unable to give any assurance, if and when the Civil Disobedience Movement ceases, that local Governments would find it possible to release all persons convicted or under trial for offences in connection with the movement not involving violence, and that while I should wish to see a generous policy pursued in the matter, the utmost that I could promise would be to [ask] all the local Governments to consider with sympathy all the cases individually on their merits.
('50', 470, 2, 4, 782716) Upon the point of your reference to the representation of the Congress at the Conference in the event of their abandoning the Civil Disobedience Movement and desiring to attend, my recollection is you explained that the demand of the Congress was not for predominant, in the sense of majority, representation at the Conference and that I expressed the view that I should anticipate little difficulty in recommending to His Majesty's Government to secure that the Congress should be adequately represented.
('50', 470, 2, 5, 783222) I added that if events so developed, I should be ready to receive a panel of names from the leaders of the Congress Party of those whom they would regard as suitable representatives.
('50', 470, 2, 6, 783405) I feel that you and Mr. Jayakar would desire to be clearly informed of the position of myself and my Government as it may be desirable that the letters should be published at an early date in order that the public may be fullyinformed of the circumstances,in which your efforts have failed to produce the result you hoped and they so certain]y deserved.
('50', 470, 3, 7, 783759) Yours sincerely, IRWIN

('50', 470, 7, 11, 783852) (a) On the constitutional question, the position would be as stated in the four fundamental points in para 2 of the Viceroy's letter to us of 28th August.
('50', 470, 8, 12, 784007) (b) With reference to the question whether Mr. Gandhi would be allowed to raise at the Round Table Conference the question of India's right to secede from the Empire at will, the position was as follows: As the Viceroy has stated in his said letter to us, the Conference was a free conference.
('50', 470, 8, 13, 784301) Therefore, anyone could raise any points he liked, but the Viceroy thought it would be very unwise for Mr. Gandhi to raise this question now.
('50', 470, 8, 14, 784443) If, however, he faced the Government of India with such a question, the Viceroy would say the Government were not prepared to treat it as an

('50', 471, 1, 2, 784792) open question.
('50', 471, 1, 3, 784807) If, in spite of this, Mr. Gandhi desired to raise the question, the Government would inform the Secretary of State of his intention to do so at the Round Table Conference.
('50', 471, 2, 4, 784979) (c) As regards the right to raise the question at the Round Table Conference of India's liability to certain financial burdens and to get them examined by an independent Tribunal, the position was that the Viceroy could not entertain any proposition amounting to total repudiation of all debts, but it would be open to anyone to raise, at the Round Table Conference, any question as to any financial liability of India and to call for its examination.
('50', 471, 3, 5, 785431) (d) As regards the granting of relief against the Salt Act, the position of the Viceroy was that (1) the Salt Tax was going to be provincialized if the recommendation of the Simon Commission in that behalf was accepted, and (2) there has been already great loss of revenue and therefore the Government would not like to forgo this source, but if the Legislature was persuaded to repeal the Salt Act and if any proposal was put forward to make good the loss of revenue occasioned by such repeal, the Viceroy and his Government would consider the question on its merits.
('50', 471, 3, 6, 786000) It was not, however, possible for the Viceroy to condone open breaches of the Salt Act so long as it was law.
('50', 471, 3, 7, 786110) When goodwill and peace were restored and, if Indian leaders desired to discuss with H. E. the Viceroy and his Government how best economic relief couldbe given to the poorer classes on his behalf, the Viceroy would be glad to call a small conference of Indian leaders.
('50', 471, 4, 8, 786380) (e) With reference to picketing, the position was that if picketing amounted to nuisance to any class of people or was coupled with molestation or intimidation or the use of force, the Viceroy reserved to the Government the right of taking such action as the law allowed or taking of such legal powers as might be necessary to meet any emergency that might arise.
('50', 471, 4, 9, 786744) Subject to the above when peace was established the Ordinance against picketing would be withdrawn.
('50', 471, 5, 10, 786844) (f) With regard to the re employment of the officers who resigned or had been dismissed during the Civil Disobedience campaign, the position was that this matter was primarily a question for the discretion of local Governments.
('50', 471, 5, 11, 787072) Subject however to there being vacancies and as long as it did not involve dismissing men who had proved loyal, the local Government would be expected to re employ men who had thrown up their appointments in a fit of excitement or who had been swept off their feet.
('50', 471, 6, 12, 787338) (g) As for the restoration of printing presses confiscated under the Press Ordinance, there would be no difficulty.
('50', 471, 7, 13, 787454) (h) As regards the restoration of fines and properties confiscated under the Revenue Law, that required closer definition.
('50', 471, 7, 14, 787577) As to the properties confiscated or sold

('50', 472, 1, 2, 787663) under such law, there might be the rights of third parties involved.
('50', 472, 1, 3, 787732) As to refunding fines, there were difficulties.
('50', 472, 1, 4, 787780) In short, all that the Viceroy could say was that the local Government would exercise their discretion with justice and take all the circumstances into consideration and try to be as accommodating as they could.
('50', 472, 2, 5, 787992) (i) As to the release of prisoners, the Viceroy had already explained his views in his letter to us dated July 28th.

('50', 472, 5, 8, 788142) NOTE FROM NEHRUS1
('50', 472, 6, 9, 788160) NAINI CENTRAL PRISON, August 31, 1930
('50', 472, 7, 10, 788198) We have had further interviews with Mr. M. R. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru yesterday and today, and have had the advantage of long talks with them.
('50', 472, 7, 11, 788351) They have given us a copy of the letter, dated August 23, addressed to them by His Excellency Lord Irwin.
('50', 472, 7, 12, 788457) In this letter, it is stated clearly that Lord Irwin regards discussion on the basis of the proposals contained in our joint letter of August 15 to Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar as impossible, andunder the circumstances, he rightly concludes their efforts have failed to produce any result.
('50', 472, 7, 13, 788756) This joint letter, as you know, was written after a full consideration by the signatories to it, and represented the utmost they were prepared to go in their individual capacities.
('50', 472, 7, 14, 788937) We stated there that no solution would be satisfactory unless it fulfilled certain vital conditions, and that a satisfactory declaration to that effect was made by the British Government.
('50', 472, 7, 15, 789125) If such a declaration was made, we would be prepared to recommend to the Working Committee the advisability of calling off Civil Disobedience, provided simultaneously certain steps indicated in our letter were taken by the British Government in India.
('50', 472, 8, 16, 789377) It was only after a satisfactory settlement of all these preliminaries, that the question of the composition of the proposed London Conference and of the Congress being represented at it could be decided.
('50', 472, 8, 17, 789582) Lord Irwin, in his letter, considers even a discussion on the basis of these proposals as impossible.
('50', 472, 8, 18, 789684) Under the circumstances, there is or can be no common ground between us.
('50', 472, 8, 19, 789757) Quite apart from the contents, the tone of the letter and the recent activities of the British Government in India clearly indicate that the Government has no desire for peace.
('50', 472, 8, 20, 789934) The proclamation of the Working Committee as an illegal body in the Delhi Province soon after a meeting of it was announced to be held there, and the subsequent arrest of most of its members can have that meaning and no other.
('50', 472, 8, 21, 790161) We have no complaint against these or other arrests or other activities of the Government, 'uncivilized' and 'barbarous' as we
('50', 472, 9, 22, 790288) 1 Vide 1st footnote of Statement to T. B. Sapru and M. R. Jayakar, 5 9 1930
('50', 473, 0, 1, 790364) 474 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 473, 1, 2, 790406) consider some of these to be.
('50', 473, 1, 3, 790436) We welcome them.
('50', 473, 1, 4, 790453) But, we feel, we are justified in pointing out that a desire for peace and an aggressive attack on the very body, which is capable of giving peace and with which it is sought to treat, do not go well together.
('50', 473, 1, 5, 790663) The proscription of the Working Committee all over India and the attempt to prevent its meetings must necessarily mean that the national struggle must go on, whatever the consequences, and that there will be no possibility of peace, for those who may have some authority to represent the people of India will be spread out in British prisons all over India.
('50', 473, 2, 6, 791021) Lord Irwin's letter and the action taken by the British Government make it plain that the efforts of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar have been in vain.
('50', 473, 2, 7, 791179) Indeed, the letter and some of the explanations that had been given to us take us back, in some respects, even from the position that was previously taken.
('50', 473, 2, 8, 791335) In view of the great HIATUS that exists between our position and Lord Irwin's, it is hardly necessary to go into details, but we should like to point out to you certain aspects of his letter.
('50', 473, 2, 9, 791527) The first part of the letter is practically a repetition of his speech to the Legislative Assembly and of the phrases used in his letter dated July 16, addressed to Mr. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.
('50', 473, 2, 10, 791731) As we pointed out in our joint letter, this phraseology is too vague for us to assess its value.
('50', 473, 2, 11, 791828) It may be made to mean anything or nothing.
('50', 473, 2, 12, 791872) In our joint letter, we have made it clear that a complete National Government responsible to the people of India, including control over the DefenceForces and economic control, must be recognized as India's immediate demand.
('50', 473, 2, 13, 792098) There is no question of what are usually called safeguards or any delay.
('50', 473, 2, 14, 792171) Adjustments there necessarily must be for the transference of power and in regard to these we stated that they were to be determined by India's chosen representatives.
('50', 473, 3, 15, 792339) As regards India's right of secession at will from the British Empire and her right to refer British claims and concessions to an independent tribunal all that we are told is that the Conference will be a free conference and any point can be raised there.
('50', 473, 3, 16, 792595) This is no advance on the previous statement made.
('50', 473, 3, 17, 792646) We are further told, however, that if the British Government in India were definitely faced with the possibility of the former question being raised, Lord Irwin would say they were not to treat it as an open question.
('50', 473, 3, 18, 792864) All they could do was to inform the Secretary of State of our intention to raise the question at the Conference.
('50', 473, 4, 19, 792977) As regards the other proposition, we are told that Lord Irwin could only entertain the idea of a few individual financial transactions being subjected for scrutiny.
('50', 473, 4, 20, 793142) While such scrutiny may take place in individual cases, its scope will have to extend to the whole field of British claims including, as we have stated, the so called Public Debt of India.
('50', 473, 4, 21, 793331) We consider both these questions as of vital importance and previous agreement in our joint letter seems to us essential.
('50', 473, 5, 22, 793453) Lord Irwin's reference to the release of prisoners is very restricted and unsatisfactory.
('50', 473, 5, 23, 793543) He is unable to give an assurance that all of the non violent civil disobedience prisoners even will be discharged.
('50', 473, 5, 24, 793659) All he proposes to do is to leave the matter in the hands of the Local Governments.
('50', 473, 5, 25, 793743) We are not prepared to trust in such a
('50', 474, 0, 1, 793782) VOL.50 : 23 AUGUST, 1930 5 JANUARY, 1931 475
('50', 474, 1, 2, 793827) matter to the generosity or sympathy of Local Governments or local officials but, apart from this, there is no reference in Lord Irwin's letter to other non violent prisoners.
('50', 474, 1, 3, 794003) There are a large number of Congressmen and others who were sent to prison for political offences prior to the Civil Disobedience Movement.
('50', 474, 1, 4, 794143) We might mention in this connection the Meerut Case prisoners who have already spent a year and a half as under trials.
('50', 474, 1, 5, 794263) We have made it clear in our joint letter that all these persons should be released.
('50', 474, 2, 6, 794348) Regarding the Bengal and the Lahore Case Ordinances we feel no exception
('50', 474, 3, 7, 794421) should be made in their favour as suggested by Lord Irwin.
('50', 474, 3, 8, 794480) We have not claimed
('50', 474, 4, 9, 794500) release for those political prisoners who may have been guilty of violence not
('50', 474, 5, 10, 794579) because we would not welcome their release but because we felt that as our movement
('50', 474, 6, 11, 794663) was strictly non violent, we would not confuse the issue.
('50', 474, 6, 12, 794721) But, the least we can do is
('50', 474, 7, 13, 794749) to press for ordinary trial for these fellow countrymen of ours and not by an
('50', 474, 8, 14, 794827) extraordinary court constituted by an Ordinance which denies them the right of
('50', 474, 9, 15, 794906) appeal and the ordinary privilege of accused.
('50', 474, 10, 16, 794952) Amazing events including the brutal assaults that have occurred even in open
('50', 474, 11, 17, 795029) court during the so called trial make it imperative that the ordinary procedureshould
('50', 474, 12, 18, 795115) be followed.
('50', 474, 12, 19, 795128) We understand that some of the accused in protest against the treatment
('50', 474, 13, 20, 795200) accorded to them have been on hunger strike for a long period and are now at death's
('50', 474, 14, 21, 795285) The Bengal Ordinance, we understand, has been replaced by an Act of the Bengal
('50', 474, 15, 22, 795364) Council.
('50', 474, 15, 23, 795373) We consider this Ordinance and any Act passed on it most objectionable,
('50', 474, 16, 24, 795445) and the fact that an unrepresentative body like the present Bengal Council has passed
('50', 474, 17, 25, 795531) it does not make it any the better.
('50', 474, 18, 26, 795567) As regards the further picketing of foreign cloth and liquor shops, we are told,
('50', 474, 19, 27, 795648) Lord Irwin is agreeable to the withdrawal of the Picketing Ordinance, but he states
('50', 474, 20, 28, 795732) that if he thinks it necessary, he will take fresh legal powers to combat picketing.
('50', 474, 21, 29, 795817) Thus, he informs us that he might re enact the Ordinance or do something in Simla to
('50', 474, 22, 30, 795902) it whenever he considers it necessary.
('50', 474, 22, 31, 795941) The reply regarding the Salt Act and certain
('50', 474, 23, 32, 795986) other matters referred to in our joint letter is also wholly unsatisfactory.
('50', 474, 23, 33, 796063) We need not
('50', 474, 24, 34, 796075) deal with it at any length here as you are an acknowledged expert on salt.
('50', 474, 24, 35, 796150) We would
('50', 474, 25, 36, 796159) only say we see no reason to modify our previous position as regards these matters.
('50', 474, 26, 37, 796243) Thus Lord Irwin has declined to agree to all the major propositions and many of the minor ones laid down in our joint letter.
('50', 474, 26, 38, 796369) The difference in his outlook and ours is very great, indeed fundamental.
('50', 474, 26, 39, 796443) We hope you will show this note to Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel, Mr. Jairamdas Doulatram and in consultation with them give your reply to Mr. Jayakar and Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru.
('50', 474, 26, 40, 796634) We feel that the publication of the correspondence must no longer be delayed, and we are not justified in keeping
('50', 475, 0, 1, 796748) 476 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('50', 475, 1, 2, 796790) the public in the dark.
('50', 475, 1, 3, 796814) Even apart from the question of publication, we are requesting Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mr. Jayakar to send copies of all correspondence and relevant papers to Chaudhri Khaliq Usman, the Acting President of the Indian National Congress.
('50', 475, 1, 4, 797052) We feel we ought to take no steps without immediate information being sent to the Working Committee, which happens to be functioning.
