('38', 0, 1, 2, 41) 1. SPEECH AT MEETING OF DEPRESSED CLASS SCHOOLS, CALCUTTA 1
('38', 0, 2, 3, 101) January 2, 1927
('38', 0, 3, 4, 117) Mahatmaji in reply said that he never knew that the members of the depressed classes would present him with an address.
('38', 0, 3, 5, 237) He felt their troubles and untold miseries and he sometimes wanted to become an untouchable so that he would clearly realize their position in the country.
('38', 0, 3, 6, 393) Mahatmaji was sorry to say that the members of the Hindu community were not helping them in any way.
('38', 0, 3, 7, 494) On the other hand, they were having their service in the way of labour.
('38', 0, 3, 8, 566) The country would be ruined if that feeling prevailed in the Hindu community.
('38', 0, 3, 9, 644) Swami Shraddhanand who had sacrificed his valuable life in removing untouchability from the country had said that, if he saw that the Hindus were keeping at least one depressed class boy in their house, he would think that the Hindus were really feeling for the untouchables in the country.
('38', 0, 3, 10, 935) Before that Swamiji expected that they should give up the habit of drinking, gambling, and other vices which always kept them behind the other communities in the country.
('38', 0, 4, 11, 1106) Continuing, Mahatmaji said that Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya had issued an appeal to collect five lakhs of rupees to complete the shuddhi and sangathan movement of Swami Shraddhanand.
('38', 0, 4, 12, 1289) Malaviyaji did not expect any money from them as he knew the members of the Hindu community would fulfil his desire for their good.
('38', 0, 4, 13, 1421) Still as a mark of respect to the sacred memory of Swami [Shraddhanand] they should collect some money among themselves and approach Malaviyaji with the purse.

('38', 0, 7, 16, 1661) [January 2, 1927] 3
('38', 0, 8, 17, 1681) In declaring the foundation to be well and truly laid, 4 Gandhiji emphasized what Dr. Nilratan Sarkar had described as the spiritual unity between Deshbandhu and Gandhiji which had become, if possible, more real after Deshbandhus death.
('38', 0, 8, 18, 1918) He had no doubt that, if Deshbandhus energies had not been absorbed, like all other political leaders, by politics owing to the peculiar conditions of enslaved India, he
('38', 0, 9, 19, 2088) 1 Gandhiji was replying to an address of welcome presented by the students of sixteen depressed class schools in Calcutta and Howrah.
('38', 0, 9, 20, 2222) The meeting was held at Mirzapur Park, Calcutta.

('38', 1, 0, 1, 2465) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 1, 1, 2, 2505) would have entirely devoted himself to religious reform and to the service of Daridranarayana 1 .
('38', 1, 1, 3, 2603) But Deshbandhu believed, said Gandhiji, in following the lesson of the GitaDo your immediate duty, even though other duties may seem to be superiorand if he seemed that day to be laying the foundation of an ordinary maternity home, he was sure that from the point of view of Deshbandhu it was a step forward to swaraj.
('38', 1, 1, 4, 2922) He then alluded to the suspicion expressed in some quarters that the Bengalis being of a parochial outlook, the memorial would also take a parochial character.
('38', 1, 1, 5, 3082) I would not mind the Bengalis absorbing the whole of India in Bengal, for then the old Panditji 2 from the U.P. and myself, an old Bania from Gujarat, would be left free to have some rest.
('38', 1, 1, 6, 3271) I would not mind in the least the whole of India being absorbed in Bengal that gave birth to Rabindranath, Ram Mohan Roy, Keshub Chandra Sen, Ramakrishna Paramahansa and Vivekanand, Bengal which was hallowed by the sacred feet of Chaitanya, Bengal which is sanctified by the sacred rivers the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.
('38', 1, 1, 7, 3592) But the fear is baseless, as Dr. Bidhan Roy has declared on behalf of the trustees, that Seva Sadan would be conducted on the same broad lines as [those on which] Deshbandhu served the Motherland.
('38', 1, 1, 8, 3789) The institution is a living tribute to one who had the emancipation of women at heart, those down trodden sisters of ours who are the victims of our lust and passion.
('38', 1, 1, 9, 3956) It does not belong to this or that trustee, it belongs to the nation.
('38', 1, 1, 10, 4026) Let us strive to make it worthy of Deshbandhu and let it immortalize his memory in India.

('38', 1, 3, 13, 4192) January 2, 1927
('38', 1, 4, 14, 4208) Mahatma Gandhi made a short speech on the occasion.
('38', 1, 4, 15, 4260) He said that he laid the
('38', 1, 5, 16, 4285) foundation of a memorial in honour of one of the greatest patriots of Bengal, nay, of
('38', 1, 6, 17, 4371) whole India.
('38', 1, 6, 18, 4384) Mahatma Gandhi thought himself very fortunate in performing the
('38', 1, 7, 19, 4448) ceremony.
('38', 1, 7, 20, 4458) He regretted that he could not come into intimate acquaintance with Aswini
('38', 1, 8, 21, 4533) When Mahatmaji was in South Africa, he used to read newspapers during the
('38', 1, 9, 22, 4607) Bengal Partition days and it was there that he got acquainted with Aswini Babus
('38', 1, 10, 23, 4687) 1 God in the form of the destitute 2 Madan Mohan Malaviya 3 Gandhiji was laying the foundation for a memorial to Aswini Kumar Du tt .

('38', 2, 1, 2, 4862) works through the papers.
('38', 2, 2, 3, 4888) On his return to India, Mahatmaji continued, he had the privilege to have darshan of the late Aswini Kumar Dutt and that was during his Bengal tour when he went to Barisal.
('38', 2, 2, 4, 5061) At Barisal, as soon as he got down from the steamer, he was told that Aswini Babu was lying on sick bed and hence could not come to welcome him.
('38', 2, 2, 5, 5206) So he thought it his first and foremost duty to go directly and see the great patriot on his sick bed.
('38', 2, 2, 6, 5309) He still remembered that loving look when he met Aswini Babu and he could never forget it.
('38', 2, 3, 7, 5400) Mahatmaji next recognized that the lesson we learnt from the life of Aswini Kumar was that only those could be the worshippers of the motherland who had given up all pleasures of life and sacrificed all their desires for the cause of the country.
('38', 2, 3, 8, 5647) Mahatmaji advised young Indians to learn the spirit in which Aswini Kumar led his life, and that was the lesson that every young man should learn from the life of the great men of the world.
('38', 2, 4, 9, 5838) Mahatmaji further said that many things could be heard about many people in the papers, but untill and unless one could come in contact with those men, one was not able to get the truth about them.
('38', 2, 4, 10, 6036) When Mahatmaji came in close contact with Aswini Dutt, he realized the absolute truth of what he had read in the papers.
('38', 2, 5, 11, 6157) Mahatmaji, in conclusion, appealed to young men to mix with such great men and follow in their footsteps if they wanted to serve the country, and the only true memorial that they could raise in the name of such great men was only to follow in their footsteps.

('38', 2, 8, 15, 6508) You will see that he 3 has staked his all on Khadi.
('38', 2, 8, 16, 6560) Many of you will think that he has gone mad, but I tell you it is faith that moves mountains, and Satis Babu has faith in khadi, and the determination that he must stop, as much as he can, the lakhs of rupees worth of foreign cloth that is dumped every day in the Calcutta market.
('38', 2, 9, 17, 6841) In response to his appeal for collections, Rs. 500 were collected on the spot and Rs. 3,000 and odd were promised.

('38', 3, 2, 3, 7303) [After January 2, 1927] 1
('38', 3, 3, 4, 7329) GANGABEHN, I find that you make mistakes in gender.
('38', 3, 3, 5, 7381) In the Kutchhi dialect there are only [two] gendersfeminine and masculine.
('38', 3, 3, 6, 7456) But in Gujarati there is a third, the neuter gender.
('38', 3, 3, 7, 7509) You say ghar kevo 2, while in Gujarati we say ghar kevun 3, you say tamaro sharir 4, while in Gujarati we would say tamarun sharir 5. You will find it interesting to compare the two languages in this manner and will be able to correct your mistakes more easily.
('38', 3, 3, 8, 7771) Such mental exercise will also develop your intellect.

('38', 4, 3, 6, 8956) You have to love humanity in spite of itself.
('38', 4, 3, 7, 9002) The Ashram is finally not at Sabarmati but in yourself.
('38', 4, 3, 8, 9058) The vilest beings must enter there purified.
('38', 4, 3, 9, 9103) That is the meaning of treating all alike and in this universe of opposites remaining unaffected even as the lotus remains unaffected by water though immersed in it.

('38', 5, 5, 10, 10679) DEAR SISTERS, This time I have not yet received your weekly letter.
('38', 5, 5, 11, 10747) We have shifted today to the new buildings erected on the land purchased by the Khadi Pratishthan.
('38', 5, 5, 12, 10846) They have built many small houses here.
('38', 5, 5, 13, 10886) The houses took only nine months to build.
('38', 5, 5, 14, 10929) The processes of washing, bleaching and dyeing khaddar with the aid of machines are now carried on here.
('38', 5, 5, 15, 11034) There was a big gathering here yesterday.
('38', 5, 5, 16, 11076) Theatten dance was very good.
('38', 5, 5, 17, 11106) I thought that I should ask for a collection from the audience; I did, and got about Rs. 3,500/ .
('38', 5, 5, 18, 11204) Prayers are held here just as we hold them there.
('38', 5, 5, 19, 11254) The verses which they recite are also the same.
('38', 5, 5, 20, 11302) But their recitation is out of tune, compared to ours, and so it jars a little on the ear.
('38', 5, 5, 21, 11393) But gradually they will improve.
('38', 5, 5, 22, 11426) Perinbehn, Mithubehn and Jamnabehn are still with me.
('38', 5, 5, 23, 11480) They are carrying on their khadi work.
('38', 5, 5, 24, 11519) They have sold about half the stock they had brought with them.
('38', 5, 5, 25, 11583) It is a very good thing that your prayers are held regularly.
('38', 5, 5, 26, 11645) I note that they are also well attended.
('38', 5, 5, 27, 11686) Do not forget that spinning is yajna.
('38', 5, 5, 28, 11724) The Gita says that he who eats food without offering yajna eats stolen food.
('38', 5, 5, 29, 11801) Yajna means work done for the good of others.
('38', 5, 5, 30, 11847) For us spinning is such public work.

('38', 8, 1, 2, 15330) 14. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, COMILLA 1
('38', 8, 2, 3, 15370) January 5, 1927 You have been so kind to me in giving me permission to speak in Hindi.
('38', 8, 2, 4, 15457) If only because I want to show you my appreciation of your kindness, I propose to say a few words to you in English.
('38', 8, 2, 5, 15574) Every time that I am obliged to speak in the English language before an audience of my countrymen, I feel humiliated and ashamed.
('38', 8, 2, 6, 15704) I have urged upon Bengali audiences several times not to put an undue strain upon my loyalty, not to put an undue strain upon Bharatamata herself.
('38', 8, 2, 7, 15851) It is the easiest thing possible for every Indian north of the Vindhya range to pick up Hindi inside of a month.
('38', 8, 2, 8, 15964) Try it and tell me if what I say is not true.
('38', 8, 2, 9, 16010) Let us not say that our mother tongue is only Bengali or Gujarati or Punjabi, as the case may be.
('38', 8, 2, 10, 16108) These are provincial languages.
('38', 8, 2, 11, 16140) When we sing that ode to the MotherlandBande Mataram, we sing it to the whole of India.
('38', 8, 2, 12, 16228) When Bankim 2 wrote the inspired song he said sapt akoti bhujaih 3. But you and others deliberately said dwi trimshatkoti bhujaih 4 and it was proper.
('38', 8, 2, 13, 16379) It was proper and dignified on your part to sing of dwi trimshatkoti bhujaih, and it was proper and dignified for the whole of India to accept that magnificent ode.
('38', 8, 2, 14, 16544) Shall we not then live up to it and sing with all our hearts and say we are sons of Mother India, not merely sons of Bengal?
('38', 8, 2, 15, 16669) I ask you, therefore, next time I happen to come here or you invite me to come, to insist upon my speaking to you in Hindi and Hindi alone.
('38', 8, 2, 16, 16809) That is one thing.
('38', 8, 2, 17, 16828) We have seen the last of the last session of the Congress.
('38', 8, 2, 18, 16887) On the sacred banks of the Brahmaputra, in the midst of that magnificent foliage and scenery almost unrivalled in the world, our leaders deliberated.
('38', 8, 2, 19, 17037) They have evolved a Council programme.
('38', 8, 2, 20, 17076) But how many of us can take a direct part in the working of that programme?
('38', 8, 2, 21, 17152) How many of us can enter Councils and the Legislative Assembly?
('38', 8, 2, 22, 17216) How many of us are entitled to elect members to these legislative bodies?
('38', 8, 2, 23, 17290) Are the millions of the villagers of India enfranchised?
('38', 8, 2, 24, 17347) Is India living in her 10 or 20 cities, or is she living in her 700,000 villages?
('38', 8, 2, 25, 17429) What then is the programme that can weld together the 30 crores of people scattered on a surface 1,900 miles long and 1,500 miles broad in
('38', 8, 3, 26, 17568) 1 The meeting was held at Mahesh Prangan.
('38', 8, 3, 27, 17610) 2 Bankim Chandra Chatterji 3 Seven crore armsa reference to the population of Bengal at the time 4 Sixty crore armsa reference to the population of India
('38', 9, 0, 1, 17764) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 9, 1, 2, 17805) 700,000 villages?
('38', 9, 1, 3, 17823) What is it that every villager, man, woman and child, Hindu and Mussalman, can do with profit and, at the same time, uplift the whole of India?
('38', 9, 1, 4, 17967) The one and unequivocal answer is the spinning wheel and khaddar.
('38', 9, 1, 5, 18033) The message of khaddar can penetrate to remotest villages if we only will that it shall be so.
('38', 9, 1, 6, 18128) The spinning wheel can be turned by millions of the villagers of India who have been reduced to pauperism, who have been ground down to dust, not merely under the foreigners heels but under your heels, under my heels.
('38', 9, 1, 7, 18346) We the city dwellers are living upon the labour, upon the wealth of these millions of villagers; not like the Americans, not like the Englishmen, who live upon the exploitation of Asiatic races or the so called weaker races of the earth.
('38', 9, 1, 8, 18584) Even they would be obliged to take up the spinning wheel or any equivalent if they were not able to exploit India, China, Africa and other parts of the earth.
('38', 9, 1, 9, 18743) We do not exploit them, because it is a virtue of necessity with us.
('38', 9, 1, 10, 18812) But I hope that a time is coming when out of the fullness of our hearts, out of a wider national outlook, we shall disdain of our own free will to exploit a single nation of the earth, no matter how weak.
('38', 9, 1, 11, 19017) I hope that in your lifetime and mine that time is coming when we shall reach our freedom and having reached it, we shall say to all the nations of the earth that they need not fear us, as we have lived in perpetual fear of the so called civilized races of the earth.
('38', 9, 1, 12, 19285) You may not believe me today.
('38', 9, 1, 13, 19315) You may call me, if you like, a mad man.
('38', 9, 1, 14, 19356) But the time is coming when you will say that what this old man said was right and that, if India was really to prosper in her villages and not in her cities, the spinning wheel was the only instrument of Indias prosperity and Indias freedom.
('38', 9, 1, 15, 19599) And hence it was that you saw the phenomenon at Gauhati, which I did not expect, which I had not asked for, however much I desired it.
('38', 9, 1, 16, 19734) But you saw at Gauhati the extraordinary phenomenon of the Congress franchise being improved along khaddar lines.
('38', 9, 1, 17, 19848) I know there were bickerings about it.
('38', 9, 1, 18, 19887) But I also know that it was the pressure of the popular mind that extorted that improvement in the franchise.
('38', 9, 1, 19, 19997) The leaders made that important improvement because they saw that khaddar and khaddar alone was the only passport to the hearts of the villagers.
('38', 9, 1, 20, 20143) Let me assure you that it was khaddar that won the elections for the Swarajists.
('38', 9, 1, 21, 20224) You may not know, or perhaps you know, that in Madras even those who were otherwise opposed to khaddar were obliged to take it up at the time of appealing to the electorate, and as the days roll on, you will find that khaddar will gain in importance, because it has intrinsic worth about it; and because no national popular organization contains for its working so many self sacrificing, able, young, educated men as the khaddar organization; because no
('38', 10, 0, 1, 20678) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 11
('38', 10, 1, 2, 20720) organization is capable of giving employment to an almost unlimited number of patriotic youths who will be content with an honourable livelihood and who will be content to pass their lives in the closest touch with the villagers and share their food, their sorrows and joys.
('38', 10, 1, 3, 20995) I invite you to show me a single other organization which has that capacity in it.
('38', 10, 1, 4, 21078) Believe me, khaddar is not a dying cult.
('38', 10, 1, 5, 21119) There is no fall in the barometer of khaddar.
('38', 10, 1, 6, 21165) Five years experience show that it has been an undoubtedly gradual, but a steady and hopeful rise.
('38', 10, 1, 7, 21264) It could not have been otherwise.
('38', 10, 1, 8, 21298) Because India wants it, because Indias millions require full means in order to sustain their energy, therefore the Con gress has passed the resolution making it necessary for Congress men to wear khaddar habitually and not merely on ceremonial occasions.
('38', 10, 1, 9, 21553) They may wear mill cloth on rare occasions, when it is absolutely necessary for their bread and butter; but they dare not, if they are honest Congressmen, habitually wear anything but hand spun and hand woven khaddar.
('38', 10, 1, 10, 21771) And now a word about untouchability.
('38', 10, 1, 11, 21808) A great hero and patriot Swami Shradhanandji died for the sake of the untouchables.
('38', 10, 1, 12, 21892) He loved them as dearly as his own life.
('38', 10, 1, 13, 21933) He regarded them as his own children, and, if it was in his power, he would have banished untouchability from the shores of India.
('38', 10, 1, 14, 22064) And what does that banishment mean?
('38', 10, 1, 15, 22100) It means universal love.
('38', 10, 1, 16, 22125) It means translating into action the great message of the Bhagavad Gita which is: Treat the Brahmin and the Bhangi alike, if you would but know God.
('38', 10, 1, 17, 22274) But how are they alike?
('38', 10, 1, 18, 22298) A Brahmin is any day superior to the Bhangi in learning, and how am I to treat both alike?
('38', 10, 1, 19, 22389) The Bhagavad Gita says that you should treat them even as you would wish to be treated by them, or even as you would treat yourself:
('38', 10, 4, 20, 22522) That is the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita.
('38', 10, 4, 21, 22565) That hero and martyr translated this teaching into action in his own life and he has sanctified it, and sealed it with his blood.
('38', 10, 4, 22, 22695) Let that blood purify us, and let it remove the last taint of any isolation or aloofness that we may be harbouring against those brothers of ours whom in our arrogance we call untouchables.
('38', 10, 4, 23, 22885) They are not untouchables, we are untouchables.
('38', 10, 4, 24, 22933) Let them have every attention, every kindness that they deserve from
('38', 10, 5, 25, 23002) 1 This is not to be found in the Bhagavad Gita; cf., however, VI, 29 & 32, with one of which, it is possible, Gandhiji confused it.
('38', 11, 0, 1, 23134) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 11, 1, 2, 23175) During my Comilla visit, I have seen two villages which are predominantly occupied by the so called untouchables.
('38', 11, 1, 3, 23289) Had I not been told, I should not have known that the people I saw were untouchables.
('38', 11, 1, 4, 23375) I could see no difference between them and the others who were standing with them there.
('38', 11, 1, 5, 23464) They eat and drink and think and feel even as we do.
('38', 11, 1, 6, 23517) If a sum total of their virtues and vices and the privileges they are denied were to be made and compared with our virtues and vices and the privileges we enjoy and deny to them, I am sure in Gods books we should find our debit side far heavier than theirs.
('38', 11, 1, 7, 23775) Let us then think no more of any single person on earth as an untouchable.
('38', 11, 1, 8, 23850) That is the lesson that comes down to us form South Africa too.
('38', 11, 1, 9, 23914) A just Nemesis has descended upon us there.
('38', 11, 1, 10, 23958) Just as we are treating our brothers here, our kith and kin are being treated as pariahs and Bhangis in South Africa.
('38', 11, 1, 11, 24076) The moment we purge ourselves of the sin, the moment we are free from the curse of untouchability, you will find the shackles dropping off our countrymen in South Africa.
('38', 11, 1, 12, 24247) I dare not touch the problem of Hindu Muslim unity.
('38', 11, 1, 13, 24299) It has passed out of human hands, and has been transferred to Gods hands alone.
('38', 11, 1, 14, 24379) Even as Draupadi, forsaken by her husbands, forsaken by men and gods alike, asked God and God alone to come to her help, and God gave her unfailing help, so it is with me and so should it be with every one of us.
('38', 11, 1, 15, 24592) Let us ask for help from God, the All Powerful and tell Him that we His tiny creatures have failed to do what we ought to do, we hate one another, we distrust one another, we fly at one anothers throat and we even become assassins.
('38', 11, 1, 16, 24824) Let our hearts cry then ascend to His throne, and let us wash His feet with tears of blood and ask Him to purge our hearts of all hatred in us.
('38', 11, 1, 17, 24968) We are disgracing His earth, His name and this sacred land by distrusting and fearing one another.
('38', 11, 1, 18, 25067) Although we are sons and daughters of the same motherland, although we eat the same food, we have no room for one another.
('38', 11, 1, 19, 25190) Let us ask God in all humility to give us sense, to give us wisdom.
('38', 11, 1, 20, 25258) You have listened to me with the greatest attention.
('38', 11, 1, 21, 25311) I have given you also what I dont willingly give to the audiencean English speech, and that also at some length.
('38', 11, 1, 22, 25424) I now want my reward.
('38', 11, 1, 23, 25446) I want you tomorrow to come to the Abhoy Ashram and denude it of every yard of khaddar in its store, if my message, the message of the paupers of India, has gone home to you.
('38', 11, 1, 24, 25621) There you will see a band of workers working for them and for you.
('38', 11, 1, 25, 25688) They are the link between you
('38', 12, 0, 1, 25718) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 13
('38', 12, 1, 2, 25760) and the villagers.
('38', 12, 1, 3, 25779) They are trying to do their level best to serve the motherland.
('38', 12, 1, 4, 25843) I want you to put your hands into your pockets and give me what you have and what you can and what you will, not out of shame, not out of any pressure that you may feel becuase you are in this meeting, not out of patronage for me or affection for me.
('38', 12, 1, 5, 26094) I shall use your affection for other work if you will give me your affection.
('38', 12, 1, 6, 26172) But I want you to give me what you can and what you have for the sake of paupers, for the sake of those who do not even get one square meal a day.
('38', 12, 1, 7, 26319) If you are satisfied that this organization is being worked well, and with ability and self sacrifice, and if you are convinced that it is not sinful to wear khaddar and it cannot be wrong to wear khaddar woven and spun by your starving countrymen, and that it is right and proper and necessary to do so, you will give your coppers and silver and gold, whatever you may have.
('38', 12, 1, 8, 26695) If you have any suspicion about it, any doubts in the matter, I ask you to restrain your hands and not to give me a single pie.
('38', 12, 1, 9, 26823) If not today, at least on some near date, you will be convinced of the message.
('38', 12, 1, 10, 26903) But if you are convinced that this is the right thing although you may not have the strength to carry out the message fully into practiceyou will support this great, aye the greatest, national industry.
('38', 12, 1, 11, 27106) There is no better way of industrializing the villages of India than the spinning wheel.
('38', 12, 1, 12, 27195) No man has yet been able to show a better or more effective substituteI say even an equal substitutethan the spinning wheel for the millions of Indians who are idle for at least four months in the year, who are starving for want of a square meal, and for whom even one anna a day means a fortune.
('38', 12, 1, 13, 27492) I plead on behalf of them.
('38', 12, 1, 14, 27519) May God help you to understand this simple message.
('38', 12, 1, 15, 27571) You will recall that last time I was in Bengal, I collected for the All Bengal Deshbandhu Memorial.
('38', 12, 1, 16, 27671) That was for what is now the Seva Sadan.
('38', 12, 1, 17, 27712) I announced then that, in due course, I would collect for the All India Deshbandhu Memorial.
('38', 12, 1, 18, 27805) You know that its object was to promote the message of the spinning wheel.
('38', 12, 1, 19, 27880) You will thus be contributing to the Memorial by contributing to khaddar.

('38', 12, 3, 21, 28014) 15. SWAMIJI AS I KNEW HIM
('38', 12, 4, 22, 28040) My first acquaintance with Swamiji was when he was Mahatma Munshiram, and that by letter.
('38', 12, 4, 23, 28130) He was then Governor of Kangri Guru kul, his great original contribution to education.
('38', 12, 4, 24, 28217) He was not satisfied
('38', 13, 0, 1, 28238) 14 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 13, 1, 2, 28279) with the orthodox Western method.
('38', 13, 1, 3, 28313) He wanted his boys to be saturated with Vedic teaching, and he taught through Hindi, not English.
('38', 13, 1, 4, 28411) He wanted them to be and remain brahmacharis during their training.
('38', 13, 1, 5, 28479) He had inspired his boys to contribute to the fund that was then being collected for the Satyagrahis of South Africa.
('38', 13, 1, 6, 28597) And he wanted them to do so by themselves labouring as coolies for hire; for, was it not a coolies fight in South Africa?
('38', 13, 1, 7, 28719) The boys rose to the occasion, earned full wages and sent them to me.
('38', 13, 1, 8, 28789) The letter he wrote to me about this incident was written in Hindi.
('38', 13, 1, 9, 28857) I was addressed as my dear brother.
('38', 13, 1, 10, 28893) It endeared me to Mahatma Munshiram.
('38', 13, 1, 11, 28930) We had never met each other before.
('38', 13, 1, 12, 28966) Andrews was the link between us.
('38', 13, 1, 13, 28999) He was anxious that whenever I returned home, I should make the acquaintance of what I used tocall his trinitythe Poet, Principal Rudra and Mahatma Munshiram.
('38', 13, 1, 14, 29158) From the time of the receipt of that letter, we became brothers in arms.
('38', 13, 1, 15, 29231) We met each other in 1915 at his favourite Gurukul and with each meeting we came closer and knew each other better.
('38', 13, 1, 16, 29347) His love of ancient India, Sanskrit and Hindi was remarkable.
('38', 13, 1, 17, 29409) He was undoub tedly a non co operator before non co operation was born.
('38', 13, 1, 18, 29481) He was impatient to gain swaraj.
('38', 13, 1, 19, 29514) He hated untouchability and was anxious to raise the status of the untouchables.
('38', 13, 1, 20, 29595) He could not brook any restrict ion upon their freedom.
('38', 13, 1, 21, 29651) When the Rowlatt agitation was started, he was among the very first to hail it.
('38', 13, 1, 22, 29731) He wrote a very warm letter to me.
('38', 13, 1, 23, 29766) But the suspension of Satyagraha after the Amritsar and Viramgam tragedies he could not understand.
('38', 13, 1, 24, 29866) From that period our differences commenced but they never once disturbed the brotherly relations that subsisted between us.
('38', 13, 1, 25, 29990) The differences showed to me his childlike nature.
('38', 13, 1, 26, 30041) He blurted out the truth as he knew it without regard to consequences.
('38', 13, 1, 27, 30112) He was daring to a fault.
('38', 13, 1, 28, 30138) I observed more and more the temperamental differences beetween us as time progressed but they only proved to me the goodness of the soul in him.
('38', 13, 1, 29, 30284) To think audibly is no crime, it is a virtue.
('38', 13, 1, 30, 30330) It is the hallmark of truth.
('38', 13, 1, 31, 30359) Swamiji thought audibly.
('38', 13, 1, 32, 30384) The Bardoli decision broke his heart.
('38', 13, 1, 33, 30422) He despaired of me.
('38', 13, 1, 34, 30442) His open protest was most energetic.
('38', 13, 1, 35, 30479) His private letters to me were still more so but with the emphasis on the differences there was an equal emphasis on love.
('38', 13, 1, 36, 30602) He was not satisfied with an avowal of love in mere letters.
('38', 13, 1, 37, 30663) He sought me out as opportunity offered and explained his own position, tried to understand mine.
('38', 13, 1, 38, 30761) But the real reason, as it seems
('38', 14, 0, 1, 30794) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 15
('38', 14, 1, 2, 30836) to me, for seeking me out was to assure me, as if any such assurance was necessary, of undiminished love for me as for a younger brother.
('38', 14, 1, 3, 30974) My remarks about the Arya Samaj and its great author and my references to him hurt him deeply; but our friendship was strong enough to bear the strain.
('38', 14, 1, 4, 31126) He could not understand that it was possible to reconcile my general estimate of the Maharshi with the quality of forgiveness that he had in a boundless measure for personal injury .
('38', 14, 1, 5, 31309) His devotion to the Maharshi was too great to brook any criticism of him or his teachings.
('38', 14, 1, 6, 31400) He has been severely criticized and maligned in the Mussalman Press for his shuddhi movement.
('38', 14, 1, 7, 31494) I myself could not accept his standpoint.
('38', 14, 1, 8, 31536) I do not accept it even now.
('38', 14, 1, 9, 31565) But, in my opinion, he had a complete defence of his own position from his own standpoint.
('38', 14, 1, 10, 31656) Shuddhi is entitled to the same toleration that is claimed for tabligh so long as either remains within moral and legitimate bounds.
('38', 14, 1, 11, 31789) But this is not the occasion for entering into an examination of that highly controversial question.
('38', 14, 1, 12, 31890) Both the tabligh and the shuddhi which is a reply to the former, have to undergo a radical change.
('38', 14, 1, 13, 31989) Progress of liberal study of religions of the world is bound to revolutionize the existing clumsy method of proselytizing which looks to the form rather than the substance.
('38', 14, 1, 14, 32162) It is the transference of allegiance from one fold to another and the mutual decrying of rival faiths which gives rise to mutual hatred.
('38', 14, 1, 15, 32299) Swamijis assassination can be turned to good account by us if we both Hindus and Mussalmans could possibly realize the deeper meaning of shuddhi.
('38', 14, 1, 16, 32445) I cannot close the reminiscences of the life of a great reformer without recalling his last visit to the Satyagraha Ashram only a few months ago.
('38', 14, 1, 17, 32591) Let me assure my Mussalman friends that he was no hater of Mussalmans.
('38', 14, 1, 18, 32662) He undoubtedly distrusted many Mussalmans.
('38', 14, 1, 19, 32705) But he bore them no ill will.
('38', 14, 1, 20, 32735) He thought that Hindus were cowed down and he wanted them to be brave and be able to defend themselves and their honour.
('38', 14, 1, 21, 32856) In this connection he told me that he was much misunderstood and that he was absolutely innocent of many things that were said against him.
('38', 14, 1, 22, 32996) He told me he had several threatening letters.
('38', 14, 1, 23, 33043) He was warned by friends not to travel alone.
('38', 14, 1, 24, 33089) But this man of faith said,  What protection shall I seek but of God?
('38', 14, 1, 25, 33159) Not a blade of grass perishes without His will.
('38', 14, 1, 26, 33207) I know therefore that nothing can happen to me so long as He wishes me to serve through this body.
('38', 15, 0, 1, 33306) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 15, 1, 2, 33347) During this stay of his he spoke to the boys and girls of the Ashram school.
('38', 15, 1, 3, 33424) He said the best protection of Hinduism must come from within, from self purification.
('38', 15, 1, 4, 33511) He put the greatest emphasis on the need of brahmacharya for the building of character and body.

('38', 15, 4, 7, 33640) SHRADDHANAND MEMORIAL
('38', 15, 5, 8, 33662) It is in the fitness of things that there should be an appeal on behalf of the Hindu Mahasabha for funds to perpetuate the memory of the late Swami Shraddhanandji.
('38', 15, 5, 9, 33826) I congratulate the Sabha on having decided upon inviting collections for carrying on the work for which the Swamiji chiefly lived after his sannyasa.
('38', 15, 5, 10, 33976) This was removal of untouchability, shuddhi and sangathan.
('38', 15, 5, 11, 34035) The appeal has been made for five lakhs for untouchability and as many for shuddhi and sanga than.
('38', 15, 5, 12, 34134) For my own part I still remain unconvinced about the necessity of the shuddhi movement, taking shuddhi in the sense it is generally understood.
('38', 15, 5, 13, 34278) Shuddhi of sinners is a perpetual inward performance.
('38', 15, 5, 14, 34332) Shuddhi of those who can be identified neither as Hindus nor as Mussalmans or who have been recently declared converts but who do not know even the meaning of conversion and who want to be known definitely as Hindus is not conversion but prayaschitta or penance.
('38', 15, 5, 15, 34595) The third aspect of shuddhi is conversion properly so called.
('38', 15, 5, 16, 34657) And I question its use in this age of growing toleration and enlightenment.
('38', 15, 5, 17, 34733) I am against conversion whether it is known as shuddhi by Hindus, tabligh by Mussalmans or proselytizing by Christians.
('38', 15, 5, 18, 34853) Conversion is a heart process known only to and by God.
('38', 15, 5, 19, 34909) It must be left to itself.
('38', 15, 5, 20, 34936) But this is no place for airing my views on conversion.
('38', 15, 5, 21, 34992) Those who believe in it have a perfect right to follow their own course without let or hindrance, so long as it is kept within proper limits, i.e., so long as there is no force or fraud or material inducement and so long as the parties are free agents and of mature age and understanding.
('38', 15, 5, 22, 35281) Those, therefore, who believe in shuddhi have a perfect right to subscribe to the appeal.
('38', 15, 5, 23, 35371) Sangathan is really a sound movement.
('38', 15, 5, 24, 35409) Every community is entitled, indeed bound, to organize itself if it is to live as a separate entity.
('38', 15, 5, 25, 35510) I have kept myself aloof from it because of my peculiar ideas
('38', 16, 0, 1, 35572) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 17
('38', 16, 1, 2, 35614) of organization.
('38', 16, 1, 3, 35631) I believe in quality rather than quantity.
('38', 16, 1, 4, 35674) The fashion nowadays is to rely upon quantity even at the cost of quality.
('38', 16, 1, 5, 35749) Quantity has its place no doubt in social and political economy.
('38', 16, 1, 6, 35814) Only I am ill fitted for organizing quantity in the way it is done at present.
('38', 16, 1, 7, 35893) There fore, for me the appeal only for funds for the removal of untouch ability has a value.
('38', 16, 1, 8, 35986) It comes with a force all its own.
('38', 16, 1, 9, 36021) For reform of Hinduism and for its real protection, removal of untouchability is the greatest thing.
('38', 16, 1, 10, 36122) It is all inclusive and, therefore, if this the blackest spot on Hinduism is removed, you have automatically all that shuddhi and sangathan can be expected to yield.
('38', 16, 1, 11, 36288) And I say this, not because of the vast number of untouchables whom every Hindu should seek to embrace as one of his own but because consciousness of having broken down a barbarous and ancient custom and consequent purity it necessarily implies gives a strength which is irresistible.
('38', 16, 1, 12, 36573) Removal of untouchability therefore is a spiritual process.
('38', 16, 1, 13, 36633) Swamiji was a living embodiment of that reformation because he had no half measures about it, because he would not compromise, he would give no quarter.
('38', 16, 1, 14, 36786) If he could have had his way, he would have made short work of untouchability in Hinduism.
('38', 16, 1, 15, 36877) He would have opened every well and every temple to every untouchable on conditions of absolute equality and he would have braved all consequences.
('38', 16, 1, 16, 37025) I can conceive no more fitting memorial to Swami Shraddhanandji than that every Hindu should henceforth purge his heart of the uncleanliness which untou chability undoubtedly in and deal with the untouchable as with his own kith and kin.
('38', 16, 1, 17, 37263) His monetary contribution to the memorial, there fore, will, in my opinion, be merely an earnest of his irrevocable reso lution to root out the evil and cast it away once and for all from Hinduism.
('38', 16, 1, 18, 37461) The 9th day of January is the day appointed for doing public and religious reverence to the memory of the Swamiji.
('38', 16, 1, 19, 37576) I hope that the ceremony will be performed in every city and every village.
('38', 16, 1, 20, 37652) But the ceremony will lose its real significance, if at the same time those who take part in it do not purge themselves of the taint of untouchability.
('38', 16, 1, 21, 37804) Every untouchable should, therefore, take part in the ceremony; and what a great thing it would be if every temple were thrown open to the untouchables on that day.
('38', 16, 1, 22, 37969) If an organized effort is made, the collec tions could be finished without the slightest difficulty before the sun sets on the 9th January.

('38', 17, 1, 2, 38150) KHADI BOARD OF STUDIES
('38', 17, 2, 3, 38173) In selecting the Board of Studies the Council of the All India Spinners Association had included Dr. Profulla Chandra Ghoshs name in the Board subject to his acceptance of the office.
('38', 17, 2, 4, 38357) But as his acceptance was not received owing to his absence from his head quarters in time for publication, the name was withdrawn at the last moment.
('38', 17, 2, 5, 38508) Dr. Ghosh has now kindly accepted the office.
('38', 17, 2, 6, 38554) The reader will be glad to learn that the Board will have the assistance of one who has made a study of and has practical experience of the science of charkha and khadi.
('38', 17, 3, 7, 38724) PRIZE ESSAY ON HAND SPINNING
('38', 17, 4, 8, 38753) The Prize Essay on Hand Spinning and Hand weaving issued by the All India Spinners Association and written by Professor S.V. Puntambekar and Sjt.
('38', 17, 4, 9, 38899) N. S. Varadachari is a publication which I commend to the attention both of the khadi worker and the sceptic.
('38', 17, 4, 10, 39009) The khadi worker will find many things in this volume occupying 235 pages of bold type in octavo size, which he perhaps had not known before.
('38', 17, 4, 11, 39151) It has four chapters.
('38', 17, 4, 12, 39173) The first gives the history of hand spinning and hand weaving in India before the advent of the British.
('38', 17, 4, 13, 39278) The second deals with the complete ruin of hand spinning, the great est national industry, and almost complete ruin of hand weaving, the second great national industry.
('38', 17, 4, 14, 39447) The third deals with the possibilities of hand spinning and hand weaving and incidentally sets up a compa rison between mill spinning and mill weaving and hand spinning and hand weaving.
('38', 17, 4, 15, 39634) And the fourth deals with exclusion or boycott of all foreign cloth through the spinning wheel.
('38', 17, 4, 16, 39730) The authors give facts and figures for every statement made by them.
('38', 17, 4, 17, 39799) The price of the book is one rupee.
('38', 17, 4, 18, 39835) Copies can be had from the office of the All India Spinners Association, Ahmedabad, or from Mr. S. Ganesan, Current Thought Press, Triplicane, Madras, by send ing one rupee and two annas to cover postage.

('38', 17, 6, 21, 40079) When, in Cawnpore, the Assam delegates gave the invitation to hold the Congress of 1926 at Gauhati and the Congress accepted the invitation I was filled with misgivings.
('38', 17, 6, 22, 40249) I felt that Assam was too far away, too unorganized and too poor to shoulder the heavy burden of
('38', 18, 0, 1, 40346) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 19
('38', 18, 1, 2, 40388) holding a Congress session.
('38', 18, 1, 3, 40416) Gauhati has a population of only 16,000. No place with such a small population has, before Gauhati, had the temerity to invite the Congress.
('38', 18, 1, 4, 40557) Gauhati, however, beat all previous records, and in an incredibly short space of time erected, in the midst of surroundings of great natural beauty on the banks of the great Brahmaputra, a city under khadi canvas.
('38', 18, 1, 5, 40771) The huge Congress pavilion itself was made of pure Assam khadi.
('38', 18, 1, 6, 40835) The Reception Committee had to import material and men from outside in order to provide for the varied tastes of delegates and visitors from different provinces.
('38', 18, 1, 7, 40997) Leaders quarters were isolated from the delegates quarters.
('38', 18, 1, 8, 41057) When I resented the isolation, I was told that it was not done intentionally, but it had to be done because there was not enough ground available in one single spot to provide accommodation for all.
('38', 18, 1, 9, 41256) The construction of the cottages was incredibly simple,Assam bamboo, Assam mud, Assam straw, Assam khadi and Assam labour were responsible for the very simple but artistic huts erected on the Brahmaputra bank.
('38', 18, 1, 10, 41466) And as Mr. Phookan led me to one of these beautiful huts, he said,Now it must delight your heart in that we are giving you not a palace miscalled hut, as you had remarked in Belgaum 1, but we are giving you a proper hut, only we cannot claim any merit for it because it is a virtue of necessity; for we could have given you nothing more, nothing less. I was, however, more than glad for this virtue of necessity.
('38', 18, 1, 11, 41879) Let not the reader however imagine for one moment that there was in any degree whatsoever less comfort in these artistic huts than in the palatial looking structure that was provided in Belgaum.
('38', 18, 1, 12, 42074) All the other arrangements so far as I gather were in keeping with this artistic simplicity.
('38', 18, 1, 13, 42167) The address of the Chairman 2 of the Reception Committee was equally simple and equally artistic and therefore naturally brief.
('38', 18, 1, 14, 42295) Proceedings commenced punctually at the advertised time.
('38', 18, 1, 15, 42352) No time was lost in ceremonial functions.
('38', 18, 1, 16, 42394) In a few minutes Mr. Phoo kans brief address was finished, the President 3 amidst shouts of applause walked to the rostrum and read his address.
('38', 18, 1, 17, 42539) The suppressed gloom cast over the assembly through the news of the assassination of Swami Shraddhanandji was no doubt there, but it was not allowed to be made visible.
('38', 18, 1, 18, 42708) The delegates knew that Swamiji had died a heros

('38', 19, 1, 2, 42905) death and it therefore demanded no tears but action and so the busin ess part of the Congress went on as if nothing had happened.
('38', 19, 1, 3, 43035) The ceremonial was severely cut off including the usual presidential procession.
('38', 19, 1, 4, 43116) The address of the President for the matters it covers is brief enough.
('38', 19, 1, 5, 43188) I pass by the references to the Councils and the defence of the Swarajist attitude which occupies half of the address.
('38', 19, 1, 6, 43307) The constructive programme has its due share given to it.
('38', 19, 1, 7, 43365) The place of honour is assigned to khaddar.
('38', 19, 1, 8, 43409) The President trusts that the All India Spinners Association will become a nation wide labouror ganization which, if it cannot be identical with swaraj, will go some way towards it.
('38', 19, 1, 9, 43591) It can become that if every Congressman and every Congresswoman will do his or her duty.
('38', 19, 2, 10, 43680) The spinning wheel has by its persuasiveness affected to a visible
('38', 19, 3, 11, 43747) extent the national psychology, and has lent a new dignity to our manhood
('38', 19, 4, 12, 43821) and womanhood.
('38', 19, 4, 13, 43836) This was more than exemplified by the enthusiastic manner in which the amendment in the franchise clause regarding khaddar was acce pted by the Congress in spite of stubborn opposition offered to it.
('38', 19, 4, 14, 44036) No wonder that the President considers that khaddar is at once the radiant symbol of our self reliance and of our power of resistance.
('38', 19, 4, 15, 44171) In the constructive programme the second place is given to prohibition and the President correctly pleads guilty to the charge that we have not lately paid much attention to the question of total prohibition.
('38', 19, 4, 16, 44380) He says,
('38', 19, 5, 17, 44389) The movement will gain in moral grandeur if we successfully organize the will of the nation in that behalf.
('38', 19, 5, 18, 44497) He remarks that
('38', 19, 6, 19, 44513) No minister has during the past six years been found, and I doubt whether a minister will now be found, to be courageous enough to bring in a bill for total prohibition and to resign his office on its rejection or disallowance.
('38', 19, 6, 20, 44741) There is something somewhere utterly wrong if, in a place like India which is overwhelmingly dry, ministers are unwilling to provide what is the nations due, namely, total prohibition.
('38', 19, 6, 21, 44926) There is as much flaw in the argument that it is an interference with the right of the people, as there would be in the argument that the laws prohibiting theft interfere with the right of thieving.
('38', 19, 6, 22, 45125) A thief steals all earthly possessions, a drunkard steals his own and his neighbours honour.
('38', 20, 0, 1, 45218) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 21
('38', 20, 1, 2, 45260) surprises me to discover that the President has failed to suggest the obvious method of providing for the deficit of revenue.
('38', 20, 1, 3, 45386) There is a huge military expenditure, so much of which is utterly useless and based upon distrust of the nation.
('38', 20, 1, 4, 45499) It is capable of reduction by more than 25 crores which is the revenue from drinks and drugs.
('38', 20, 1, 5, 45593) Untouchability comes next.
('38', 20, 1, 6, 45620) He does not think that it is neces sary to wait for swaraj till untouchability is removed.
('38', 20, 1, 7, 45711) He cites the capital instance, in his favour, of the United States of America achiev ing freedom long before the abolition of a very real and widespread slavery.
('38', 20, 1, 8, 45873) But he hastens to add,
('38', 20, 2, 9, 45896) We must all agree that we must make an end of untouchability, apart from any question of swaraj and whether we ever win swaraj or not.
('38', 20, 2, 10, 46031) And then this Brahmin philosopher lays down that
('38', 20, 3, 11, 46080) the higher philosophy of Hinduism as well as the history of the religious dissidence in our country emboldens me to claim that the rule regarding untouchability has neither part nor lot with the indestructible soul of Hinduism.
('38', 20, 3, 12, 46308) Judged by any test humanitarian, rational or spiritual, patriotic or democratic, we cannot with decency uphold in Hinduism the dogma of an immutable untouchability.
('38', 20, 3, 13, 46473) It clouds our vision, limits our experience, hardens our heart, narrows our sphere of responsibility and prevents our ideals of justice, love and sincerity from being perfect.
('38', 20, 3, 14, 46649) I congratulate the President for this eloquent and severe condemnation of the curse that has descended upon Hinduism.
('38', 20, 3, 15, 46767) The next heading is labour and unemployment.
('38', 20, 3, 16, 46812) I am inclined to think that this needs more diligent study than appears to have been given to it.
('38', 20, 3, 17, 46910) It requires, in my opinion, considerable revision.
('38', 20, 3, 18, 46961) I suggest that the charkha movement with all its implications provides the largest form of relief to the unemployment of millions.
('38', 20, 3, 19, 47092) The currency policy of the Government has also claimed a paragraph in his address.
('38', 20, 3, 20, 47175) The President cordially welcomes the for mation of the Indian currency League and trusts that it will adequately educate public opinion on the question of the ratio, the gold standard, gold currency and other cognate questions.
('38', 20, 3, 21, 47403) He says:
('38', 20, 4, 22, 47412) But I am certain the League will be able to achieve nothing, either by debate and vote in the Assembly or by protest outside, unless it comes into line with the Congress and unless its members harness themselves to the dynamic politics of the Congress.
('38', 21, 0, 1, 47665) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 21, 1, 2, 47706) Indian States have also found a paragraph in the address.
('38', 21, 1, 3, 47764) Greater India naturally follows the paragraph on Indian States.
('38', 21, 2, 4, 47828) The status of Indians abroad, whether in South Africa or Kenya, in Fiji or Guiana, in Ceylon or Malaya, in America or Australia, depends inevitably upon the status of Indians in their own land; and swaraj for India depends in its turn upon the brave and unfaltering spirit of our kith and kin across the seas.
('38', 21, 2, 5, 48138) I suppose the presidential suggestion  of the holding once in a way of a session of the Congress in South Africa is merely a pious wish.
('38', 21, 2, 6, 48275) The subject deserves better examination than it has received.
('38', 21, 2, 7, 48337) I presume the absence of any reference to Mr. Andrewss signal services is an unintentional oversight due to the many local pre occu pations of the very busy President.
('38', 21, 2, 8, 48505) The Asiatic Federation comes in too for a few lines.
('38', 21, 2, 9, 48558) Mr. Iyen gar deplores that we have too long neglected the possibilities of a cultural and business union with all Asiatic countries. I venture to suggest that the cultural union is being sufficiently attended to by our great Poet and the business union by the great commercial firms.
('38', 21, 2, 10, 48842) The irrepressible optimism of the President is to be observed in the paragraphs upon Communalism and Nationalism.
('38', 21, 2, 11, 48956) He says:
('38', 21, 3, 12, 48965) I am confident that wherever intensive propaganda, sincere and persuasive, clearly analyses the fallacies underlying it, communalism will go to the wall.
('38', 21, 3, 13, 49119) Happily, prejudice and suspicion are not deep seated amongst Indians and communalism is but their offspring.
('38', 21, 3, 14, 49228) Under the heading Plea for Tolerance, one reads the following pregnant sentences:
('38', 21, 4, 15, 49310) Though each community should be free to make conversions, no resort to conversion is really any longer useful or necessary.
('38', 21, 4, 16, 49434) For the lives of the best and most pious men in each community are a fitter and more effective propaganda in that behalf than definite missionary effort.
('38', 21, 4, 17, 49588) But wherever the latter is made, it should be open and general and neither secret nor directed to the converting of particular men or women.
('38', 21, 4, 18, 49729) Let us realize that no great and long established religion gains in truth, beauty or spirituality with any increase in its census figures.
('38', 21, 4, 19, 49868) He winds up the paragraph by quoting the following beautiful passage from Ashokas inscriptions:
('38', 21, 5, 20, 49964) He who does reverence to his own sect while disparaging the sects of others wholly from attachment to his own, with intent to enhance the splendour of his own sect, in reality by such conduct inflicts the severest injury on his own sect.
('38', 22, 0, 1, 50202) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 23
('38', 22, 1, 2, 50244) The President is evidently against communal representation.
('38', 22, 1, 3, 50304) He says:
('38', 22, 2, 4, 50313) That much abused expression communal representation is a misnomer; for all the communities are equally interested in all public questions and in the countrys problems and in particular solutions of them.
('38', 22, 2, 5, 50517) Again he says:
('38', 22, 3, 6, 50532) Let us realize clearly that to uphold justice between man and man is to uphold justice between community and community.
('38', 22, 3, 7, 50652) As a safeguard a negative rule against members of any community or caste monopolizing offices is all that is required.
('38', 22, 3, 8, 50771) The President remarks:
('38', 22, 4, 9, 50794) The intrusion into politics of religion, and very often of dogmatic religion, must be resisted as a primitive or mediaeval idea, born of theocracies, and disastrous alike to religion and to politics.
('38', 22, 4, 10, 50994) But he adds:
('38', 22, 5, 11, 51007) I do not speak of morality or of that spiritual quality which is common to
('38', 22, 6, 12, 51082) all religions; for thereby politics and organizations are cleansed and made sweet and wholesome.
('38', 22, 6, 13, 51179) Iyengar adds:
('38', 22, 7, 14, 51193) Let us not forget, in the fever of political controversy, that the strength of each religion is derived from God and rooted in the souls of Prahlads.
('38', 22, 7, 15, 51343) Not all the tortures of a Torquemada 1, nor all the burning at the stakes, nor all the forms of persecution have been able to destroy the mystic quality of the human soul.
('38', 22, 7, 16, 51515) Neither Hinduism nor Islam derives or requires strength either from the present or from any future Government.
('38', 22, 7, 17, 51626) Both stand far, far above swaraj which is not comparable to them.
('38', 22, 7, 18, 51692) Neither foreign governments nor self governments, neither democracies nor autocracies, can destroy that seed of faith which is in every one of us, that inspired interpretation of the universe to which one clings for guidance and solace in this world and for salvation in the next.
('38', 22, 7, 19, 51973) The last three pages of the address are devoted to a fervent appeal for unity.
('38', 22, 8, 20, 52052) There can be only two parties in India, the party of the Government and its adherents that obstruct swaraj, and the party that fights visibly and unceasingly for swaraj .
('38', 22, 8, 21, 52223) I deprecate the philosophy of individualism in a supreme struggle for freedom against a powerful people with their trained bureaucracy and with unlimited material resources.
('38', 22, 8, 22, 52397) On a question whether a

('38', 23, 1, 2, 52603) particular course is wise or unwise, will succeed or fail, will accelerate swaraj or retard it, to make ones opinion or judgment or feeling a matter of conscience is false philosophy.
('38', 23, 1, 3, 52787) On a point of religion, of morality, of honour, ones own conscience must be the arbiter, but in transacting the affairs of a country, when a decision is not irreligious, immoral or dishonourable, I fail to see how we may rely on our right to differ from one another and yet uphold the discipline necessary for an organization fighting for swaraj.
('38', 23, 1, 4, 53134) The conclusion is in keeping with the fervency of the appeal and the deep emotion that underlies every line of this address.
('38', 23, 1, 5, 53259) He says:
('38', 23, 2, 6, 53268) Swaraj is not an intellectual but an emotional proposition.
('38', 23, 2, 7, 53328) We must cherish it in our hearts with unquenchable faith.
('38', 23, 2, 8, 53386) We must become possessed by a passion for swaraj that is not warped by fallacies and impulses, that will stand for a uniform and rapid corporate advance in serried masses, that will know no obstacles, that will not wax and wane with the seasons, that will not be daunted by imprisonments or depressed by failures.
('38', 23, 2, 9, 53700) Let me hope that the appeal will find an echo in the hearts of us all.
('38', 23, 2, 10, 53771) The resolutions do not require an elaborate examination.
('38', 23, 2, 11, 53828) Besides the condolence resolutions, there is of course the Council resolution for the guidance of Council wallas, then the resolutions about South Africa and Kenya, the Bengal detenus and the Gurdwara prisoners.
('38', 23, 2, 12, 54040) The khaddar clause in the constitution is, in my opinion, altered for the better.
('38', 23, 2, 13, 54122) The ceremonial wear had become the laughing stock of all.
('38', 23, 2, 14, 54180) Habitual wear of khaddar is the right thing if khaddar wear should find a place in our franchise qualifications.
('38', 23, 2, 15, 54293) It is to be hoped that every Congress worker will enforce this resolution in his own person and induce others to do likewise.
('38', 23, 2, 16, 54419) But I must deal more fully in a subsequent issue with many other things that were discussed in the Subjects Committee in connection with the resolutions withdrawn or rejected.

('38', 24, 2, 3, 54721) With reference to the statement 1 issued by Mr. T. C. Goswami 2 on the habitual
('38', 24, 3, 4, 54801) khadi wear resolution passed by the Congress at Gauhati the following interview was
('38', 24, 4, 5, 54885) granted to a representative of the Free Press of India by Mahatma Gandhi: I tender my congratulations to Mr. Goswami upon his frank statement on khaddar.
('38', 24, 4, 6, 55039) It should clear the atmosphere of cant, hypo crisy and humbug.
('38', 24, 4, 7, 55102) Khaddar must stand or fall on its own merits.
('38', 24, 4, 8, 55148) Mr. Goswami betrays a mental attitude which no doubt makes any mention of khaddar repugnant to him.
('38', 24, 4, 9, 55248) His is not an objection to khaddar as a fetish but it is an objection to khaddar even as an econo mic factor, because he says that khaddar may be even an economic waste and permanent exclusion of foreign cloth may not be a desirable thing.
('38', 24, 4, 10, 55488) If I thought like Mr. Goswami I should also object to the khaddar clause as strongly as he does.
('38', 24, 4, 11, 55585) The change from ceremo nial to habitual wear was not due to my prompting.
('38', 24, 4, 12, 55659) But I have no hesitation in endorsing the change as desirable and even necessary for the growth of a true national life.
('38', 24, 4, 13, 55780) Politics apart from nationalism I do not understand.
('38', 24, 4, 14, 55833) I consider boycott of foreign cloth not merely as a political expedient but as a permanent duty.
('38', 24, 4, 15, 55930) I regard it as immediately possible in terms of khaddar if we have the will.
('38', 24, 4, 16, 56007) I go a step further and say that boycott of foreign cloth through khaddar is the only thing the nation is capable of achieving within a measurable distance of time, and since the economic aspect of khaddar includes organization of the whole nation towards one single effort, it has tremendous political consequences.
('38', 24, 4, 17, 56324) If, therefore, it is right and proper to restrict the membership of the Congress to those who desire swaraj and to exclude those who wish to retain the present British domination, it is equally right to restrict the membership to those who desire and work for the boycott of foreign cloth, through active, continuous and persistent khaddar production and sale.
('38', 24, 4, 18, 56685) It is the beauty of khaddar and not its limitation, as Mr. Goswami suggests, that it is no respecter of persons and that it can adorn the body of a government spy as much as that of a saintly servant of India, whoever

('38', 25, 1, 2, 57015) he may be.
('38', 25, 1, 3, 57026) For the nation includes all the highest and the lowest, the healthy and the unhealthy, the good as well as the wicked.
('38', 25, 1, 4, 57145) But it should be the privilege of the good to reform the wicked and serve them.

('38', 25, 4, 8, 57297) Next he addressed a big gathering of ladies, where he said that they must have swaraj, which meant Ramarajya which again could not come without Sita.
('38', 25, 5, 9, 57447) exhorted all to attain the virtues of Sita and to wear clothes made by their own hands
('38', 25, 6, 10, 57534) as Sita used to do, and also to follow the examples of Sita by leading a simple and
('38', 25, 7, 11, 57618) pure life.
('38', 25, 7, 12, 57629) He concluded by saying that the charkha was the only cure for pauperism.
('38', 25, 8, 13, 57702) When he appealed for funds for the All India Deshbandhu Memorial, the ladies contributed some money and some of them even gave away their gold ornaments.

('38', 25, 11, 16, 57916) [KASHI,] Saturday [January 8, 1927] 1
('38', 25, 12, 17, 57954) MANI, I have your letter.
('38', 25, 12, 18, 57980) It is good that you are studying with Valjibhais help.
('38', 25, 12, 19, 58035) You will learn much from him.
('38', 25, 12, 20, 58065) I do not know why you have been relieved of your teaching work, for I could not understand the reasons from the letter in which the news was conveyed to me.
('38', 25, 12, 21, 58222) You yourself should be bold and ask the reason.
('38', 25, 12, 22, 58270) I thought that the reason must have been explained to you.
('38', 25, 12, 23, 58329) I remained unconcerned by the news because, irrespective of whether or not you teach, you continue to stay in the Ashram, and the salary, or whatever you name it, will continue to be paid to you.
('38', 25, 12, 24, 58525) The responsibility for you is mine.
('38', 25, 12, 25, 58561) You should not get angry with the teachers .
('38', 25, 12, 26, 58606) They have to run the institution, and so they may act as they think proper.
('38', 25, 12, 27, 58682) But you have a right to know the reason, and you shall know it.
('38', 25, 13, 28, 58746) 1 As in the printed source

('38', 26, 1, 2, 58815) You should now get ready to learn spinning.
('38', 26, 1, 3, 58859) You should learn everything that goes with it, that is to say, repairing the spinning wheel, recognizing the different varieties of cotton, ginning, pressing, carding, spinning, moistening the yarn, making skeins, joining thebroken threadall these processes.
('38', 26, 1, 4, 59118) You should learn to make a mal 1 and to wind the sadi 2 round the spindle.
('38', 26, 1, 5, 59193) Moreover, wherever you go you should learn what else you can besides these processes, and as part of this programme of studies you should improve your proficiency in Hindi and Sanskrit.
('38', 26, 1, 6, 59379) In studying Sanskrit, you should know the meaning of every verse in the Gita along with its syntax.
('38', 26, 1, 7, 59479) And of course, you should learn to spin on the takli.
('38', 26, 1, 8, 59533) There was a telegram from Karachi to say that your name has been sent to the Board.
('38', 26, 1, 9, 59617) I am happy.
('38', 26, 1, 10, 59629) Write to me regularly and go on working very cheerfully.
('38', 26, 1, 11, 59686) Now, from the 2nd to the 8th I shall be in Gondia, Nagpur, Wardha, Akola and Amaravati.
('38', 26, 1, 12, 59774) I am not certain about the towns on the programme.
('38', 26, 1, 13, 59825) It will be better to address your letters to Wardha.

('38', 26, 4, 17, 59984) I publish in this issue Shri Govindji Jadavdass letter under the heading which he has himself given to it, viz., The Downfall of Hinduism.
('38', 26, 4, 18, 60123) The purport of his letter is this: If untouchability is to be removed, then why have separate schools, temples and wells for the untouchables?
('38', 26, 4, 19, 60266) This argument is certainly not pointless.
('38', 26, 4, 20, 60308) Similar pro blems have arisen and still arise in South Africa.
('38', 26, 4, 21, 60371) I had raised the argument myself, in South Africa, that setting up of separate schools for the Indians means prolonging the life of untouchability.
('38', 26, 4, 22, 60519) Only those who have themselves suffered can realize the pain of other sufferers; in the same way I can appreciate Shri Govindjis unhappi ness.
('38', 26, 4, 23, 60662) But where I realized that it would be considered foolish on my part to ignore the existence of a thing which does exist, I did my work
('38', 26, 5, 24, 60797) 1 Belt or cord passing round the wheel and the spindle 2 Cotton thread moistened with gum
('38', 27, 0, 1, 60887) 28 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 27, 1, 2, 60928) with full realization of the discrimination which was there.
('38', 27, 1, 3, 60989) So I accepted the proposal of having separate schools.
('38', 27, 1, 4, 61044) I had also accepted [in S. Africa] the proposal for separate first and second class compar tments in trains for Indians.
('38', 27, 1, 5, 61165) Like Govindji I too had opposed such a discrimination there.
('38', 27, 1, 6, 61226) But when the mere existence of a community was in danger, I accepted such a discrimination which would virtually lead to lightening the discrimination in spite of its continuance.
('38', 27, 1, 7, 61406) For example, the Indians could formerly travel only by the third class; as a result of the agitation an order was issued allowing them to travel in first and second class compartments.
('38', 27, 1, 8, 61591) Simultaneously it was decided to have for the Indians separate first and second class coaches.
('38', 27, 1, 9, 61686) We accepted this provision even after we had opposed discrimination.
('38', 27, 1, 10, 61755) The government authorities can make arrangements [for common coac hes] but how can others be forced to sit with us?
('38', 27, 1, 11, 61871) I yielded to this line of thinking and came to the conclusion that as long as the Antyajas are not able to make use of common temples, etc., it is better to have for them separate institutions by which they may benefit, rather than totally to deprive them of the amenity.
('38', 27, 1, 12, 62143) Theoretically, untouchability has disappeared.
('38', 27, 1, 13, 62190) Still many are not yet ready to discard it altogether in practice.
('38', 27, 1, 14, 62257) What should the friends of the untouchables do so long as such a situation persists?
('38', 27, 1, 15, 62342) How else can they prove their sincerity of purpose?
('38', 27, 1, 16, 62394) The answer should be that it can be done by constructing temples, etc., for the untouchables.
('38', 27, 1, 17, 62488) Shri Govindji says that such temples, etc., may be built, but why label them with unpleasant words, for the untouchables only?
('38', 27, 1, 18, 62615) No one has assigned such unpleasant labels.
('38', 27, 1, 19, 62659) The temples, etc., which are being built are used by those who have made donations towards their cost as well as by other friends of the untouchables.
('38', 27, 1, 20, 62810) From this viewpoint the institutions built for the benefit of the untouchables are in fact for the general public.
('38', 27, 1, 21, 62925) But the untouchables have the first claim upon them.
('38', 27, 1, 22, 62978) In the matter of using these institutions, the untou chables are given the first preference, and their requirements looked to first.
('38', 27, 1, 23, 63111) Though I can fully realize the unhappiness of an Antyaja like Shri Govindji, I wish him to believe that the Antyaj Directory 1 and the underlying motive to build temples, etc., is pure, laudable and in the interests of the Antyajas.

('38', 28, 2, 3, 63490) BANARAS, January 9, 1927
('38', 28, 3, 4, 63515) BHAGWANDAS: Mahatmaji, I wish very much to know what you think of
('38', 28, 4, 5, 63581) certain measures which seem to me very helpful, or indeed indispensable, for the
('38', 28, 5, 6, 63662) welfare and progress of India in political as well as other respects.
('38', 28, 5, 7, 63732) I have been trying
('38', 28, 6, 8, 63751) my feeble best to place them before the public for the last six years, but more or less
('38', 28, 7, 9, 63839) in vain.
('38', 28, 7, 10, 63848) If they could secure your approval, the country would look at them with more
('38', 28, 8, 11, 63925) consideration, and might attempt to put them into operation, for the force of your tapasya (asceticism and self denial) is very great, and the country rightly places
('38', 28, 9, 12, 64091) great faith in you because of your great selflessness.
('38', 28, 9, 13, 64146) I put these measures into the
('38', 28, 10, 14, 64176) form of proposals for Resolutions, and requested my dear friend, Shri Shiva Prasad
('38', 28, 11, 15, 64259) Gupta, to try to get them placed before the Gauhati Congress.
('38', 28, 11, 16, 64321) But nothing more could
('38', 28, 12, 17, 64344) be done than to place copies in the hands of the members of the A.I. Congress
('38', 28, 13, 18, 64422) Committee.
('38', 28, 13, 19, 64433) With your permission I will put the same in the form of questions to you.
('38', 28, 14, 20, 64507) First of all, do you think, or not, that the essence of true swaraj, true self 
('38', 28, 15, 21, 64587) government, is that all the laws should be made by the elected representatives of the
('38', 28, 16, 22, 64673) people, and that these elected representatives should embody the higher self, and not
('38', 28, 17, 23, 64759) the lower self, of the people, that is to say, they should be the wisest, the most
('38', 28, 18, 24, 64842) experienced, the most unselfish and philanthropic persons available?
('38', 28, 19, 25, 64911) MAHATMA GANDHI: This also is among the essential features.
('38', 28, 20, 26, 64970) What other essential features are there, if any?
('38', 28, 20, 27, 65019) My ideal is that every person should realize dharma.
('38', 28, 20, 28, 65072) In that case, there will be no need left for any representatives.
('38', 28, 20, 29, 65138) That is the ideal swaraj.
('38', 28, 20, 30, 65164) There are no rulers and no ruled in that swaraj.
('38', 28, 20, 31, 65213) no government servants; all are the servants of all.
('38', 28, 20, 32, 65266) This is the ideal swaraj.
('38', 28, 20, 33, 65292) If this ideal swaraj is kept in view, mistakes would be avoided, or, at least, mini mized.
('38', 28, 20, 34, 65383) It is certain that such ideal swaraj can never be attained; but we will be able to make a near approach to it.
('38', 28, 21, 35, 65494) This is no doubt the highest kind of swaraj.
('38', 28, 21, 36, 65539) Apparently the Republic of the Uttara Kuru as described in the Mahabharata was something like this.
('38', 28, 22, 37, 65639) But the inhabitants of that happy land were all supermen and superwomen, god and goddess like Jivanmuktas and Yoga Siddhas, perfect, final, men and women,

('38', 29, 1, 2, 65913) insan ul ka mil, mard wa zan i mam (Be ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect), according to the tradition of that epic.
('38', 29, 1, 3, 66048) In view, obviously, of our present condition, however, you yourself said at the Ahmedabad Congress of 1921 that you could lead this country to Dominion Home Rule.
('38', 29, 1, 4, 66211) Would not that be the preliminary or intermediate form of swaraj which would be suitable for us now?
('38', 29, 1, 5, 66312) There must be legislatures in such swaraj?
('38', 29, 2, 6, 66355) Representatives would have to be elected for them?
('38', 29, 3, 7, 66406) These representatives should be the wisest, most experienced, most self less, most philanthropic persons available?
('38', 29, 4, 8, 66522) Electors should always keep this ideal, this guiding principle, in view?
('38', 29, 5, 9, 66595) Should this guiding principle be followed in making elections for District Boards, Municipal Boards, and other local elective bodies, as well as for the Congress Committees of all grades?
('38', 29, 5, 10, 66783) Certainly.
('38', 29, 6, 11, 66794) Is this guiding principle recognized by, is this ideal spread among, the Indian public?
('38', 29, 6, 12, 66882) To some extent.
('38', 29, 7, 13, 66898) Looking at the elections made to the Congress Committee and the various elective bodies, what inference can we draw as to the extent to which this principle is recognized and acted on?
('38', 29, 7, 14, 67083) Is the extent very small, or sufficient?
('38', 29, 7, 15, 67124) It is less than it ought to be.
('38', 29, 8, 16, 67156) This same principle should guide the elections to the legislative bodies, should it not?
('38', 29, 8, 17, 67245) It should guide all the elections that are made nowadays.
('38', 29, 9, 18, 67303) Has sufficient effort been made by leaders, individually, or by the Congress as a body, to spread this ideal among the public?
('38', 29, 9, 19, 67430) It would not be enough to say yes or no in reply to this ques tion.
('38', 29, 9, 20, 67498) I believe that the present atmosphere is not favourable for this purpose.
('38', 29, 10, 21, 67572) You said before that the principle had been recognized to some extent by the public.
('38', 29, 10, 22, 67657) What was the cause of the spread of the ideal to that small extent?
('38', 29, 10, 23, 67725) So far the effort has been individual.
('38', 29, 10, 24, 67764) When the atmosphere becomes favourable, then all persons begin to act according to such ideals without any effort.

('38', 30, 1, 3, 67990) It should be made unceasingly.
('38', 30, 2, 4, 68021) What kind of effort would be helpful?
('38', 30, 2, 5, 68059) The number of the individuals who make this effort should increase constantly.
('38', 30, 2, 6, 68138) And there is, and has always been, only one way to bring about this increase, viz., that those who believe in this ideal should cling to it in the face of all difficulties.
('38', 30, 3, 7, 68311) That is to say, individuals should spread the ideal by teaching and preaching, in speech and writing?
('38', 30, 3, 8, 68413) Individuals should preach by the example of their conduct.
('38', 30, 3, 9, 68472) Speeches and writings are also of help.
('38', 30, 3, 10, 68512) Conduct includes speaking and writing.
('38', 30, 4, 11, 68551) I entirely agree that preaching has no force if the preacher does not act up to his own advice.
('38', 30, 4, 12, 68647) But while you have been putting on khaddar and working the charkha yourself, you have also, side by side, with the setting of this personal example, been preaching them very extensively and very diligently.
('38', 30, 4, 13, 68854) And that is why they are spreading.
('38', 30, 4, 14, 68890) So too you have been preaching assiduously and widely various measures connected with non violent non co operation.
('38', 30, 4, 15, 69006) Do you not think that in this very important matter also it is very necessary to give advice to and remind the public persistently as thus: Whenever you have to elect representatives, you should elect persons of such and such qualifications?
('38', 30, 4, 16, 69248) Without such advice, will not the general public remain in darkness, without any guide, in this exceedingly important matter?
('38', 30, 4, 17, 69374) This question is right.
('38', 30, 4, 18, 69398) But really the answer to it is included in my previous answer.
('38', 30, 4, 19, 69461) I regard advising and preaching as part of conduct generally.
('38', 30, 4, 20, 69523) I do not give a separate place to precept because when a person cannot set a good example his precept is useless, and often becomes harmful.
('38', 30, 4, 21, 69664) And he who keeps his conduct right does as a fact give advice also whenever there is an opportunity.
('38', 30, 5, 22, 69765) But so far as I am aware, you have not advised the Indian public as yet, in your
('38', 30, 6, 23, 69846) speeches and writings, as to the qualifications they should look for in the persons
('38', 30, 7, 24, 69930) they elect.
('38', 30, 7, 25, 69942) Not once but many times have I given this advice, in speech and writing.
('38', 30, 8, 26, 70015) Should I find writings on the subject in Young India?
('38', 30, 9, 27, 70069) I will search.
('38', 30, 9, 28, 70084) In the meanwhile, will you kindly tell me what means should be employed, what rules followed, to secure properly qualified representatives?
('38', 30, 9, 29, 70224) So far as I can see, the general complaint is that the representatives chosen are not of the right
('38', 31, 0, 1, 70323) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 31, 1, 2, 70364) quality, either in the self governed countries of the West or in present day India under the new election system.
('38', 31, 1, 3, 70478) This is the one chief and serious defect in current systems of self government, is it not?
('38', 31, 1, 4, 70569) And this is the reason why I strongly oppose Council entry.
('38', 31, 1, 5, 70629) So long as the people do not realize swatva (i.e., spirituality), so long as their intelligence is not awake, so long it will not be possible to secure purity in elections by any laws.
('38', 31, 1, 6, 70814) And this purity has a large part in my present efforts.
('38', 31, 1, 7, 70870) From the very beginning my endeavour has been directed towards the increase of the power, the soul force of the people, by self purification and tapasya (self denial, riyazat, nafs kushi).
('38', 31, 1, 8, 71059) By such tapasya their intelligence will be purified and recti fied.
('38', 31, 1, 9, 71127) Because of this, the persons who were elected for Municipal Boards, etc., after the commencement of the non co operation move ment, were good persons, and they were elected without trouble and expense.
('38', 31, 1, 10, 71329) When that atmosphere disappeared, confusion began.
('38', 31, 2, 11, 71380) By the ancient tradition of this land, tapasya (self denial, riyazat, zohd) and vidya (right knowledge) are two distinguishable (though more or less interdependent)
('38', 31, 3, 12, 71545) things, and only by the combination of both is achieved that true humanity, true spirituality, or realization of God or Self or Brahman or Allah or Brahmanhood, or Kamal, however it may be called, which is what I believe you mean by swatva (selfness).
('38', 31, 3, 13, 71797) In the Puranic story we read that Ravana and others made great tapasya,
('38', 31, 4, 14, 71869) but the result of that was tyrannical earthly power and excessive luxury to them, for some time, and groaning to the rest of the world.
('38', 31, 4, 15, 72005) They made tapasya without vidya
('38', 31, 5, 16, 72037) (right knowledge).
('38', 31, 5, 17, 72056) What I feel is that in the atmosphere created by the N.C.O., there was the element of tapasya, but not of vidya (emotion and enthusiasm and self denial
('38', 31, 6, 18, 72208) but not clear intelligence and right knowledge of the essential feature of the object to be striven for); and that this was the reason why the atmosphere could not gain permanence, but dispersed in two or three years.
('38', 31, 6, 19, 72426) Do you think this belief of mine to be right or wrong?
('38', 31, 6, 20, 72481) It is generally right.
('38', 31, 6, 21, 72504) A little modification is needed.
('38', 31, 6, 22, 72537) Our tapasya at that time was not sufficient in amount.
('38', 31, 6, 23, 72592) Had it been sufficient, we should certainly have achieved the vidya also.
('38', 31, 6, 24, 72666) The Lord has said in the Gita that God gives right understanding to the person of firm devotion.
('38', 31, 7, 25, 72763) I too believe so, but devotion brings such wholesome fruit only when it is rightly directed, when its aim, its object, its ideal, is the Right Object, not otherwise.
('38', 31, 7, 26, 72929) The Gita also says: They who worship other gods go to the other gods; they who worship Me (the Higher Self) come to Me. Also : There is no purifier like unto
('38', 31, 8, 27, 73087) knowledge. My belief has therefore always been that from the very beginning of
('38', 32, 0, 1, 73166) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 33
('38', 32, 1, 2, 73208) tapasya (self denying effort), right knowledge of the essential features of the true
('38', 32, 2, 3, 73293) Goal is also absolutely indispensable; otherwise the soul force, the power, of whatever kind, gathered by tapasya, will certainly err away into wrong paths, as that
('38', 32, 3, 4, 73458) of Ravana, etc.
('38', 32, 3, 5, 73474) Is that belief of mine wrong or right?
('38', 32, 3, 6, 73513) Entirely right.
('38', 32, 4, 7, 73529) Just for this very reason have I been endeavouring, from the very beginning of the N.C.O. movement, that side by side with the tapasya (self sacrifice) of N.C.O., appropriate vidya (right knowledge) should be particularly imparted to the people, by the Congress and the leaders, as to the essential of this intermediate swaraj, i.e., Dominion Home Rule, viz., the election of duly qualified representatives.
('38', 32, 4, 8, 73937) Was this
('38', 32, 5, 9, 73946) wish of mine wrong?
('38', 32, 5, 10, 73966) If it meant that any yojana (detailed constitution) should be placed before the people, then I have arrived at the opinion that it would be of no use.
('38', 32, 5, 11, 74117) But it is quite right and proper that such know ledge should be given to the people, that they should be so awakened as will make them able to elect duly qualified representatives only.
('38', 32, 5, 12, 74303) What the qualifications of the representatives should beI do not like to fix this now.
('38', 32, 5, 13, 74390) All this should be left to the intelligence of the electors.
('38', 32, 6, 14, 74451) In respect of the charkha, the cultivation of cotton, the storing of yarn, the weaving of cloth, the selling of it, etc., you yourself and through your co workers, are constantly giving instruction and information to the people in much detail.
('38', 32, 6, 15, 74695) Do you not think it necessary to give to the people, similarly, in respect of this very important matter even some little specific indication as to the marks by which the fitness of representatives might be recognized?
('38', 32, 6, 16, 74914) Even such self evident truths, as that two and two make four, have to be taught to children with much labour.
('38', 32, 6, 17, 75024) That the charkha should be worked in leisure hours is also an almost self evident proposition; yet this also, and with all the labour you have spent on it, is not yet so widespread among the people as it ought to be.
('38', 32, 6, 18, 75241) Now then can you leave for the unaided understanding of the electors the decision of the fitness of representatives, without any instruction and guidance?
('38', 32, 6, 19, 75396) If you think it undesirable to fix any age limit, you might give indications in some other respects at least.
('38', 32, 6, 20, 75506) I have written something in this respect, and will write as I find time.
('38', 32, 6, 21, 75579) But there is no need to speak about it in the Congress.
('38', 32, 6, 22, 75635) When the people come to the occasion for electing representatives, then advice will have to be given to them about it, as is done now regarding the charkha.
('38', 32, 6, 23, 75792) Everything has its own fit time.
('38', 32, 7, 24, 75825) Which of the qualifications suggested by me in No.
('38', 32, 7, 25, 75876) 2 of my proposals for the Gauhati Congress do you think to be desirable, if any at all, for persons to be elected?
('38', 33, 0, 1, 75991) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 33, 1, 2, 76032) Almost all, but not for legislative enactment.
('38', 33, 1, 3, 76079) It is a matter essen tially for the education of the electors.
('38', 33, 2, 4, 76142) I will now ask about another matter.
('38', 33, 2, 5, 76179) Is it possible to bring about unity and peace between the followers of the several religions without explaining to them that the essentials of all these religions are one and the same?
('38', 33, 2, 6, 76364) Without showing that the various religions are one at heart, is it possible to make the various religionists one at heart?
('38', 33, 3, 7, 76487) Only when it is explained to the followers of the several religions that the heart of all religions is the same, will it become possible to make peace between the followers thereof?
('38', 33, 4, 8, 76669) What should be done to bring this about?
('38', 33, 4, 9, 76710) All the good and true followers of the several religions should preach and promulgate this fact.
('38', 33, 5, 10, 76807) What special effort have you made, or intend to make, in this behalf?
('38', 33, 5, 11, 76877) I have made enough individual effort; and it continues to be made even today.
('38', 33, 5, 12, 76955) There is a lack of persons amongst us for this prachara (propaganda), i.e., there are very few persons amongst us who might separate the merits and demerits of the various religions, bring together all the merits, and put them before the people.
('38', 33, 6, 13, 77201) Do you not think that an influential leader like yourself should bring together into a committee elected representatives, large hearted and broadminded, of the several religions current in India, who might preach such essential unity of the religions by speech, writings, and conduct?
('38', 33, 6, 14, 77486) I think I have made efforts to the extent of my powers; but it seems I have not the ability to bring together educated and learned persons for such work.
('38', 33, 6, 15, 77640) I have, therefore, contented myself with my own individual efforts.
('38', 33, 7, 16, 77708) As the time is short, I pass on to another subject.
('38', 33, 7, 17, 77760) The Hindu Sabha is laying stress on shuddhi and sangathan.
('38', 33, 7, 18, 77819) Can the work of shuddhi be done effectively
('38', 33, 8, 19, 77863) without accepting the principle of class caste by temperament and functions (and not by birth)?
('38', 33, 8, 20, 77959) And is the work of sangathan possible without first abolishing the
('38', 33, 9, 21, 78026) mutual untouchability which prevails at present in respect of dining among the
('38', 33, 10, 22, 78105) thousands of sub castes of Hindus?
('38', 33, 10, 23, 78140) I have explained my views as regards shuddhi and sangathan in Young India in the articles I wrote in appreciation of Shraddhanandji.
('38', 33, 10, 24, 78273) I am unable to say more.
('38', 33, 10, 25, 78298) I may say here, however, that even
('38', 34, 0, 1, 78333) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 35
('38', 34, 1, 2, 78375) panktibheda (Separate seats at dinner) is destructive of sangathan, without a doubt.
('38', 34, 2, 3, 78460) You have said in Young India of 6 1 1927 : Both the tabligh and the shuddhi which is a reply to the former, have to undergo a radical change.
('38', 34, 2, 4, 78602) Progress of liberal study of religions of the world is bound to revolutionize the existing clumsy method of proselytizing which looks to the form rather than the substance.
('38', 34, 2, 5, 78775) It is the transference of allegiance from one fold to another and the mutual decrying of rival faiths which gives rise to mutual hatred.
('38', 34, 2, 6, 78912) . The third aspect of shuddhi is conversion properly so called.
('38', 34, 2, 7, 78976) And I question its use in this age of growing toleration and enlightenment.
('38', 34, 2, 8, 79052) I am against conversion, whether it is known as shuddhi by Hindus, tabligh by Mussalmans, or proselytizing by Christians.
('38', 34, 3, 9, 79174) I most heartily subscribe to all this; in saying it you have completely endorsed the first two objects of the Theosophical Society, which has been working for fifty one years, and of which I have been a member for forty three.
('38', 34, 3, 10, 79401) But the growing toleration and enlightenment are obviously growing very very slowly, and the liberal study of the religions of the world, which is bound to revolutionize the existing clumsy methods of proselytizing which seek simply to change the labels and signboards on the foreheads of persons, has failed to produce its due effect, so far, on the practice of the highly educated men who are at the back of these conversion movements.
('38', 34, 3, 11, 79839) Therefore is it not desirable that a great leader like yourself should diligently help to quicken the growth of the toleration and enlightenment and the progress of the liberal study of religions, in more specific and express ways, as suggested in No.
('38', 34, 3, 12, 80091) 6 of my proposals for the Gauhati Congress, by organizing committees for the purpose all over the country, to do this vitally important work, which has been rather put aside latterly by the Theosophical Society?
('38', 34, 4, 13, 80303) When I asked in my previous question whether the principle of caste according to character and functioning (karmana varnah) was not the only legitimate basis as well as completion of shuddhi, my implication was just this that if the principle was accepted, the whole of mankind would at once be converted to essential Hinduism without anyone having to change his particular religious label or signboard.
('38', 34, 4, 14, 80707) I can only answer in the words of the seer : The distant scene I do not care to see, one step enough for me. After all, the future isdetermined by the sum total of the present activities, often contrad ictory, of mankind.
('38', 34, 5, 15, 80929) You do not, presumably, think it undesirable to form an army of volunteers for public work in connection with the Congress.
('38', 34, 5, 16, 81053) If so, do you not think that if the qualifications mentioned in No.
('38', 34, 5, 17, 81121) 5(a b) of my proposals for the Gauhati Congress were prescribed and adopted, the army would become much more efficient?
('38', 34, 5, 18, 81241) If you consider any particular qualification out of these inappropriate, or any other as more appropriate, would you very kindly mention it?
('38', 34, 5, 19, 81382) It would be desirable to form such a corps if it is possible.
('38', 34, 5, 20, 81444) The qualifications too are good.
('38', 34, 5, 21, 81477) But my experience shows that we are not
('38', 35, 0, 1, 81517) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 35, 1, 2, 81558) in a position to form any such body for all India.
('38', 35, 1, 3, 81609) It will not come into being by means of resolutions.
('38', 35, 1, 4, 81662) The Hindustan Times, 4 10 1927
('38', 35, 2, 5, 81693) 23. SPEECH AT BENARES HINDU UNIVERSITY 1
('38', 35, 3, 6, 81734) BANARAS, January 9, 1927  You have had your say now.
('38', 35, 3, 7, 81787) No one is listening to you.
('38', 35, 3, 8, 81815) Why not stop talk 
('38', 35, 4, 9, 81834) ing of khaddar? That was the advice that was being given him in some quarters.
('38', 35, 4, 10, 81913) Gandhiji said: But why should I stop reciting my favourite mantra when I have before me the example of Prahlad of old refusing to give up Rama nama in the teeth of tortures worse than death?
('38', 35, 4, 11, 82104) And I have not had to go through any tortures yet.
('38', 35, 4, 12, 82155) How can I give up the only message that the condition of my country has been whispering to me?
('38', 35, 4, 13, 82250) Panditji 2 has collected and has been still collecting lakhs and lakhs of rupees for you from Rajas and Maharajas.
('38', 35, 4, 14, 82365) The money apparently comes from these wealthy princes, but in reality it comes from the millions of our poor.
('38', 35, 4, 15, 82475) For unlike Europe the rich of our land grow rich at the expense of our villagers the bulk of whom have to go without a square meal a day.
('38', 35, 4, 16, 82613) The education that you receive today is thus paid for by the starving villagers who will never have the chance of such an education.
('38', 35, 4, 17, 82746) It is your duty to refuse to have an education that is not within the reach of the poor, but I do not ask that of you today.
('38', 35, 4, 18, 82871) I ask you to render just a slight return to the poor by doing a little yajn for them.
('38', 35, 4, 19, 82957) For he who eats without doing his yajna steals his food, say the Gita.
('38', 35, 4, 20, 83028) The yajna that was required of the British civic population during the War was for each household to grow potatoes in its yard and for each household to do a little simple sewing.
('38', 35, 4, 21, 83208) The yajna of our age and for us is the spinning wheel.
('38', 35, 4, 22, 83263) Day in and day out I have been talking about it, writing about it.
('38', 35, 4, 23, 83330) I shall say no more today.
('38', 35, 4, 24, 83357) If the message of the poor of India has touched your hearts I want you to raid Kripa lanis khaddar store tomorrow and denude it of all its stock, and to empty your pockets tonight.
('38', 35, 4, 25, 83538) Panditji has cultivated the art of beggary.
('38', 35, 5, 26, 83582) 1 The meeting was attended by about 2,000 students and was held under a shamiana specially erected for the Viceregal visit which preceded Gandhijis by just a week.
('38', 35, 5, 27, 83746) The report is extracted from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.

('38', 36, 1, 2, 83870) I have learnt it from him, and if he specializes in laying the princes under tribute, I have learnt to be equally shameless in emptying the pockets of the poor, for the benefit of those who are poorer than they.
('38', 36, 1, 3, 84082) * * * Malaviyajis one object in begging millions for you, in raising these palatial buildings, is to send out to the country gems of purest ray, citizens healthy and strong to serve their motherland.
('38', 36, 1, 4, 84282) That pur pose will be defeated if you allow yourselves to be swept with the wind that comes today from the Westthe wind of impurity.
('38', 36, 1, 5, 84415) Not that the methods have the general sanction of Europe.
('38', 36, 1, 6, 84473) There are friends in Europe, a very few, who are fighting hard to counteract the poisonous tendency.
('38', 36, 1, 7, 84574) But if you do not wake up betimes, the immoral wave that is fast gathering strength might soon envelop and overwhelm you.
('38', 36, 1, 8, 84696) I cry out to you, therefore, with all the strength at my command: Be warned, and flee from the fire before it consumes you.

('38', 36, 3, 11, 84896) January 9, 1927 It is a sacred day today and the meeting is taking place at a very good spot, where temple and mosque stand side by side.
('38', 36, 3, 12, 85034) If any Mussalman considers Swami Shraddhanand to have been an enemy, he is in error.
('38', 36, 3, 13, 85119) Swamiji died as a hero.
('38', 36, 3, 14, 85143) He pursued his mission accord ing to truth and dharma with great courage.

('38', 36, 6, 17, 85292) January 9, 1927 I thank you for the address you have presented to me.
('38', 36, 6, 18, 85362) If Mussalmans will only realize it, this is for them too a sacred day.
('38', 36, 6, 19, 85433) We have today paid homage to the memory of Swami Shraddhanand and have bathed in the Ganga.
('38', 36, 6, 20, 85525) We took the holy bath in the hope that we too might gain some of the qualities of Swamiji.
('38', 36, 6, 21, 85616) Swamiji was a friend of the untouchables.
('38', 36, 6, 22, 85658) He suffered in their suffering.
('38', 36, 6, 23, 85690) And it was for their sake that he sacrificed his life.
('38', 36, 6, 24, 85745) It was all to the good.
('38', 36, 6, 25, 85769) If someone
('38', 37, 0, 1, 85780) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 37, 1, 2, 85821) gets killed for the sake of religion it brings him only good.
('38', 37, 1, 3, 85883) He cannot die a nobler death.
('38', 37, 1, 4, 85913) Swamiji was so firm that he found it painful him self to go where untouchables were not allowed to gojust as Yudhi shthira would not go even to heaven without his companion, the dog.
('38', 37, 1, 5, 86096) The untouchables too have faults.
('38', 37, 1, 6, 86130) Some of them drink.
('38', 37, 1, 7, 86150) This they should give up.
('38', 37, 1, 8, 86176) They should not argue that after all caste Hindus drink too.
('38', 37, 1, 9, 86237) For the untouchables have got to go forward.
('38', 37, 1, 10, 86282) They should imitate virtues, not vices.
('38', 37, 1, 11, 86322) They should not gamble.
('38', 37, 1, 12, 86346) They should not lie.
('38', 37, 1, 13, 86367) They should maintain cleanliness.
('38', 37, 1, 14, 86401) Every morning and evening they should repeat the name of Rama and thus cleanse their souls.
('38', 37, 1, 15, 86493) We should all wear khadi.
('38', 37, 1, 16, 86519) For this gives livelihood to the poor.
('38', 37, 1, 17, 86558) Contri butions will be raised all over the country today for the emanci pation of the untouchables.
('38', 37, 1, 18, 86658) I want that you should also contribute at least one pice each.
('38', 37, 1, 19, 86721) I pray to God that the hearts of the so called untou chables may become pure and they may be pillars of the Hindu community.

('38', 37, 2, 21, 86874) 26. SPEECH AT MEETING OF WOMEN, BANARAS 1
('38', 37, 3, 22, 86916) January 9, 1927 Sisters, I have just come from one meeting and am on my way to another, a bigger one.
('38', 37, 3, 23, 87018) Please listen peacefully to the few words I have to say to you.
('38', 37, 3, 24, 87082) The first thing is that if you want swaraj or Ramarajya in India you have to become pure as Sita.
('38', 37, 3, 25, 87180) Sita was pure in body and mind.
('38', 37, 3, 26, 87212) When she was put through the ordeal on her return from Lanka, the flames did not even touch her.
('38', 37, 3, 27, 87309) Because she was pure not only in body but also in mind.
('38', 37, 3, 28, 87365) No cloth was imported from England at the time, English cloth was not worn.
('38', 37, 3, 29, 87441) All women plied the charkha and wore khadi.
('38', 37, 3, 30, 87485) Foreign cloth does not add to your beauty.
('38', 37, 3, 31, 87528) Real beauty consists in making body and mind pure.
('38', 37, 3, 32, 87579) Only a woman who keeps body and mind pure can be worthy of our reverence.
('38', 37, 3, 33, 87653) Therefore, sisters, wear khadi, ply the charkha and become pure.
('38', 37, 3, 34, 87718) Make your sons and daughters pure by having them wear khadi.
('38', 37, 3, 35, 87779) If you wish to give me something make some donation for khadi.
('38', 37, 3, 36, 87842) The other thing I wish to talk to you about is the death of Swami Shraddhanand.
('38', 37, 3, 37, 87922) Swamiji is not dead: he lives in our hearts.
('38', 37, 4, 38, 87967) 1 The meeting was held in the Kashi Naresh Hall of the Hindu School.

('38', 38, 1, 2, 88078) brave; he had a noble soul.
('38', 38, 1, 3, 88106) We have taken a bath in the Ganga and we have paid tribute to Swamiji.
('38', 38, 1, 4, 88177) May God impart to us some of his qualities so that we can carry on his work.
('38', 38, 2, 5, 88254) [From Hindi] Aaj, 12 1 1927
('38', 38, 3, 6, 88282) 27. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, BANARAS
('38', 38, 4, 7, 88320) January 9, 1927
('38', 38, 5, 8, 88336) Mahatmaji thanked the Municipal Board for the address presented to him and said it had been suggested to him that he should start his new programme from Banaras.
('38', 38, 5, 9, 88498) He said: I am sorry I have not come here to enunciate some new pro gramme.
('38', 38, 5, 10, 88573) Nor am I aware of any new programme.
('38', 38, 5, 11, 88610) I am afraid there fore that those who have come to this meeting looking for a new pro gramme will have to be disappointed.
('38', 38, 5, 12, 88733) I put before the people only what I feel is to their good.
('38', 38, 5, 13, 88792) There is nowhere else in the world such stark poverty as prevails in India.
('38', 38, 5, 14, 88868) The poor want work.
('38', 38, 5, 15, 88888) The peasantry want work for four months of the year.
('38', 38, 5, 16, 88941) The purpose is not fulfilled by simply distributing money among the poor.
('38', 38, 5, 17, 89015) This will make beggars of them.
('38', 38, 5, 18, 89047) The best occupation for them, the best work for the peasantry is the charkha.
('38', 38, 5, 19, 89125) No one has told me that there can be any simpler occu pation than the charkha.
('38', 38, 5, 20, 89204) I therefore appeal to you to wear khadi, ply the charkha and help in this programme.
('38', 38, 5, 21, 89289) I appeal to you to go and see the khadi exhibition after this meeting.
('38', 38, 5, 22, 89360) You will then know what fine khadi is now being produced.
('38', 38, 5, 23, 89418) If people were to help in this, ten times as much could be accomplished.
('38', 38, 5, 24, 89491) God dwells in our hearts.
('38', 38, 5, 25, 89517) If we listen to Him we shall know that it is our duty to wear cloth made by poor people.
('38', 38, 5, 26, 89606) Foreigners would even distribute their cloth free to make it acceptable to us.
('38', 38, 5, 27, 89685) Those who grudge paying a little extra money for the poor cannot be either true Hindus or true Mussalmans.
('38', 38, 5, 28, 89792) For those who will not help the poor, it is futile to think of God.
('38', 38, 5, 29, 89860) I have just come from Bangali Tola and a meeting of women at the Hindu School.
('38', 38, 5, 30, 89939) Women have made donations.
('38', 38, 5, 31, 89966) Some of them have parted with even their jewellery.
('38', 38, 5, 32, 90018) Here at this meeting also there are some sisters.
('38', 38, 5, 33, 90068) I ask them too to be pure as Sitaji.
('38', 38, 5, 34, 90105) When she was put through the ordeal, when she entered the fire, she did not get burnt, the flames did not so much as touch her.
('38', 38, 5, 35, 90233) No foreign cloth ever came
('38', 39, 0, 1, 90260) 40 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 39, 1, 2, 90301) in contact with Sitajis body.
('38', 39, 1, 3, 90331) Sitaji and her maid both plied the charkha.
('38', 39, 1, 4, 90375) During that age yarn was spun with hand and people wore hand spun cloth.
('38', 39, 1, 5, 90448) I appeal to the ladies to ply the charkha and wear khadi.
('38', 39, 1, 6, 90506) I am asked why I keep silent on the Hindu Muslim question.
('38', 39, 1, 7, 90565) We have now lost grip of this question.
('38', 39, 1, 8, 90605) Today is the jalanjali 1 day of Swami Shraddhanand.
('38', 39, 1, 9, 90657) Let us today commune with his soul.
('38', 39, 1, 10, 90693) A brother of ours became mad and killed him.
('38', 39, 1, 11, 90738) In truth he is not dead.
('38', 39, 1, 12, 90763) He lives yet.
('38', 39, 1, 13, 90777) Had the assassin not become mad this tragedy would not have occurred.
('38', 39, 1, 14, 90847) I receive letters saying that there are a number of people behind this.
('38', 39, 1, 15, 90919) I do not know.
('38', 39, 1, 16, 90934) But I know that this killing is against the teachings of the Koran.
('38', 39, 1, 17, 91002) I cannot accept that Shraddhanandji was an enemy of the Mussalmans.
('38', 39, 1, 18, 91070) I did not agree with all his views.
('38', 39, 1, 19, 91106) All the same I have repeatedly said the Mussalmans should not consider Shraddhanandji, Malaviyaji and Lalaji their enemies.
('38', 39, 1, 20, 91230) All have the right freely and fearlessly to express their views.
('38', 39, 1, 21, 91295) All can preach their several religions.
('38', 39, 1, 22, 91335) Swamiji was full of compassion for all living things.
('38', 39, 1, 23, 91389) Now of course the untouchables are treated much more humanely than before.
('38', 39, 1, 24, 91464) In this respect we have made some progress.
('38', 39, 1, 25, 91508) Swami Shraddhanand had been associated with this work from a very early stage.
('38', 39, 1, 26, 91587) Emancipation of the untouchables was the main part of his programme.
('38', 39, 1, 27, 91656) The time is now coming when Hindus and Muslims will cleanse their hearts and God will be pleased.
('38', 39, 1, 28, 91754) The only way in which we can please Swamijis soul is for all of us to help in the work for the emancipation of the untouchables.
('38', 39, 1, 29, 91883) I must tell the Hindus to wash off the stain of untouchability.
('38', 39, 1, 30, 91947) This will be true shuddhi.
('38', 39, 1, 31, 91974) They should not think of revenge.
('38', 39, 1, 32, 92008) If they do, they will cause pain to the soul of Shraddhanandji and disgrace Hinduism.
('38', 39, 1, 33, 92094) Madness cannot be answered by madness.
('38', 39, 1, 34, 92133) I appeal to the Hindus not to seek revenge, not to think of it.
('38', 39, 1, 35, 92197) Otherwise they would cause pain to the soul of Shraddhanandji.
('38', 39, 1, 36, 92260) To the Mussalmans I have to say this.
('38', 39, 1, 37, 92298) Let there not be a single Mussalman who approves this killing of Shraddhanandji even priv ately.
('38', 39, 1, 38, 92395) There is nothing in the Koran to support this.
('38', 39, 1, 39, 92442) If we wish to free India, we must cleanse our hearts.

('38', 40, 3, 4, 92678) MIRA, I have your letter, or letters is it?
('38', 40, 3, 5, 92722) I am writing this against my time for going to the station.
('38', 40, 3, 6, 92782) I am glad of all the varied experiences you are having.
('38', 40, 3, 7, 92838) I shall not be angry so long as you keep your health and your mental balance.
('38', 40, 3, 8, 92916) For the rest we learn through mistakes.
('38', 40, 3, 9, 92956) Not that I know of mistakes made by you.
('38', 40, 3, 10, 92997) But where there is consciousness of mistakes, readiness to mend is sufficient penance and antidote in a majority of cases.
('38', 40, 3, 11, 93120) I had rich experiences in Kashi, but of these I have no time to speak.

('38', 40, 7, 16, 93336) DEAR SISTERS, Only yesterday I got the letter written by Chi.
('38', 40, 7, 17, 93398) I see that your 7 oclock prayers are going on regularly and that all of you feel interested in them.
('38', 40, 7, 18, 93499) I am happy.
('38', 40, 7, 19, 93511) What Kaka Saheb has said is certainly worth bearing in mind.
('38', 40, 7, 20, 93572) Instead of replying by a mere yes or no, we should develop the ability to understand and explain the reasons for our reply.
('38', 40, 7, 21, 93696) Yesterday was the day of homage to Shraddhanandji.
('38', 40, 7, 22, 93747) Pandit Malaviyaji is here in Kashi at present.
('38', 40, 7, 23, 93794) He sent word at the last moment that we ought to go to the Ganga ghat for a bath and prayers.
('38', 40, 7, 24, 93888) I got ready and took with me the students of the Rashtriya Vidyapith who had come to see me.
('38', 40, 7, 25, 93981) We formed ourselves in twos and started.
('38', 40, 7, 26, 94022) Malavi yaji joined us and slowly our procession swelled.

('38', 41, 1, 3, 94248) It was simply grand.
('38', 41, 1, 4, 94269) The ghat is not as clean as I would wish it to be.
('38', 41, 1, 5, 94320) After bath, we went for the darshan of Kashi Vishwanath.
('38', 41, 1, 6, 94377) Mahadev will perhaps give you a description of other things there.
('38', 41, 1, 7, 94444) The German lady was with us.
('38', 41, 1, 8, 94473) It was doubtful whether she would be permitted to enter.
('38', 41, 1, 9, 94530) She is a Buddhist and hence can be regarded as a Hindu.
('38', 41, 1, 10, 94586) How could she be denied admittance?
('38', 41, 1, 11, 94622) I had decided that if she was stopped, I too would not go in.
('38', 41, 1, 12, 94684) But the priest kept quiet when he was told that she was a Hindu.
('38', 41, 1, 13, 94749) How can I describe the dirtiness of the street leading to the Kashi Vishwanath temple?

('38', 41, 5, 17, 94929) KASHI, Monday [January 10, 1927] 1
('38', 41, 6, 18, 94964) MANILAL, I have your letter.
('38', 41, 6, 19, 94993) There is no harm if Ba reads it.
('38', 41, 6, 20, 95026) I have not given it to her so far, but I intend to.
('38', 41, 6, 21, 95078) You would have done a good turn to Harilal if you had not given him even the ten rupees which you gave.
('38', 41, 6, 22, 95182) But dont mind, since you have given it.
('38', 41, 6, 23, 95222) I dont think you have made any big mistake.
('38', 41, 6, 24, 95266) Often strictness results in real kindness and kindness turns out to be cruelty.
('38', 41, 6, 25, 95346) If all people become strict with Harilal with a loving heart, his eyes would soon open.
('38', 41, 6, 26, 95434) But all of us are full of weaknesses and, therefore, cannot cultivate such loving strict ness.
('38', 41, 6, 27, 95529) Being ourselves in need of false kindness, we show such kindness to others.
('38', 41, 6, 28, 95605) I am not reproaching you for giving him ten rupees but am only trying to teach you wisdom.
('38', 41, 6, 29, 95696) You will still have many ordeals to pass through.
('38', 41, 6, 30, 95746) I have been trying to do something for you.
('38', 41, 6, 31, 95790) Have no worry on that account.
('38', 41, 6, 32, 95821) But make yourself worthy.
('38', 41, 6, 33, 95847) Do not waste a single moment.
('38', 41, 6, 34, 95877) If you have time, write an article about E. A. either for Young India or Navajivan and send it to me immediately.

('38', 42, 2, 3, 96199) January 10, 1927
('38', 42, 3, 4, 96216) MIRA, I have your letter describing the drive with Hakimji.
('38', 42, 3, 5, 96276) I do not mind either your tasting the dishes at Brijkishens or the pan from Hakimji.
('38', 42, 3, 6, 96361) The latters tempting you with pan distresses me.
('38', 42, 3, 7, 96410) It is bad stuff and he should never have offered it to you.
('38', 42, 3, 8, 96470) But opinions differ.
('38', 42, 3, 9, 96491) He evidently considers it to be harmless.
('38', 42, 3, 10, 96533) However, the reasoning that you have employed for justifying the tasting of the dishes and the pan is in my opinion faulty.
('38', 42, 3, 11, 96657) Why should one know the taste of what one does not need or wish to take?
('38', 42, 3, 12, 96730) Do you know that this is the reasoning that has been applied to justify every form of vice?
('38', 42, 3, 13, 96822) It is the million times told story of the forbidden apple: why should I not know the taste of the thing I am asked not to take or touch?
('38', 42, 3, 14, 96959) But you must not worry.
('38', 42, 3, 15, 96983) If you do not understand my reasoning, you must argue with me patiently.
('38', 42, 3, 16, 97056) If you appreciate my reasoning, it is to serve as warning in the future.
('38', 42, 3, 17, 97129) But it must not result in self reproach.
('38', 42, 3, 18, 97170) There is no cause for it.
('38', 42, 3, 19, 97196) The incident is trivial.
('38', 42, 3, 20, 97221) But trivialities possess deadly potentia lities.
('38', 42, 3, 21, 97270) Hence the paternal warning.
('38', 42, 3, 22, 97298) Now about your analysis of the Kanya Gurukul.
('38', 42, 3, 23, 97344) I hope you have spoken about it to Vidyavati.
('38', 42, 3, 24, 97390) But you must discuss it freely with Principals Ramdev and Sethi.
('38', 42, 3, 25, 97455) Principal Ramdev is her guide and if he is convinced, immediate improvement can be made.
('38', 42, 3, 26, 97544) I propose to send him the relevant extract from your letter.
('38', 42, 3, 27, 97605) That will make your position quite clear.
('38', 42, 3, 28, 97647) The insanitation, the indiscipline must go.
('38', 42, 3, 29, 97691) The anti Muslim feeling is a more difficult proposition.
('38', 42, 3, 30, 97748) But you have to do your duty.
('38', 42, 3, 31, 97778) Little girls minds must not be poisoned if we can help it.
('38', 42, 3, 32, 97837) But whilst you will talk about these things, you will remember your limits.
('38', 42, 3, 33, 97913) You have gone out to learn Hindi and to observe and gain experience, not to reform or teach.

('38', 43, 6, 8, 98596) I have your letter.
('38', 43, 6, 9, 98616) I feel that Dastanes demand is reasonable.
('38', 43, 6, 10, 98659) Just now I am touring for collecting funds.
('38', 43, 6, 11, 98703) Hence I should go in the main to places where I can expect to obtain some contributions.
('38', 43, 6, 12, 98792) But I think Akola is bound to be included in the itinerary.
('38', 43, 6, 13, 98852) There is no question of my not visiting a place which has a devoted lover of Khadi like you.
('38', 43, 6, 14, 98945) Formerly I used to tour with the idea which you have explained.

('38', 44, 3, 5, 99550) There is no reason to be unhappy about the resolution passed by the school committee with regard to Martand.
('38', 44, 3, 6, 99659) I personally feel that your decision to keep him there is best.
('38', 44, 3, 7, 99723) But if you wish to send him to Wardha there should be no difficulty.
('38', 44, 3, 8, 99792) It would be as well to know what Martand himself wants.

('38', 44, 6, 18, 100277) I may not write to you; but can I forget you?
('38', 44, 6, 19, 100323) I cannot forget you even if I want because the packet of cloves and the blankets you have given constantly remind me of you.
('38', 44, 6, 20, 100448) As for my experiences, what should I write and what not write?

('38', 45, 9, 12, 101470) DEAR FRIEND, I must apologize to you for the very long delay in acknow ledging your letter of 27th November, 1926. I duly received your first intimation which I thought was purely formal and as I had nothing effective to say, I did not send you a reply.
('38', 45, 9, 13, 101724) From your second letter, however, I observe that you were anxious to have my opinion.
('38', 45, 9, 14, 101810) But when I received it I was so overwhelmed with work that I had no time to collect my thoughts and give you a considered reply.
('38', 45, 9, 15, 101939) Even as it is, I am sending you this reply in the midst of my Bihar tour.
('38', 45, 9, 16, 102013) I hope you will accept these facts as sufficient excuse for the delay that has been caused in sending you my reply.
('38', 45, 9, 17, 102129) Probably now it is of no use, even so I gave myself the satisfaction of telling you that there was no discourtesy intended by me in the first instance in not replying and now in replying at a time when my reply may prove too late.
('38', 45, 9, 18, 102360) In matters of religion I am against any State interference, and the cow question is in India a mixed matter of religion and economy.
('38', 45, 9, 19, 102493) So far as economy is concerned, I have no doubt that it is the concern

('38', 46, 1, 2, 102674) of every State, whether Hindu or Mussalman, to conserve the cattle supply.
('38', 46, 1, 3, 102749) But, if I have understood your questionnaire rightly, the underlying note is whether the State would be justified in interposing itself between Hindus and Mussalmans and regulating cow slaughter even for purposes which Mussalmans consider to be religious.
('38', 46, 1, 4, 103005) In India which I consider to be as much the land of Hindus born in it as of Mussalmans, Christians and others born in it, even a Hindu State may not prohibit cow slaughter for purposes considered to be religious by any of its subjects without the consent of the intelligent majority of such subjects so long as such slaughter is conducted in private and without any intention of provoking or giving offence to Hindus.
('38', 46, 1, 5, 103423) That the very knowledge of any such slaughter would give offence to Hindus is inevitable.
('38', 46, 1, 6, 103513) But unfortunately we know that in India cow slaughter is often resorted to defy and wound Hindu senti ment.
('38', 46, 1, 7, 103621) This should be put down by every State that has the slightest regard for its subjects.
('38', 46, 1, 8, 103708) But in my opinion the economic side of the cow question, if it is properly handled, automatically provides for the delicate religious side.
('38', 46, 1, 9, 103848) Cow slaughter should be and can be made economically impossible, whereas unfortunately, of all the places in the world, it is the sacred animal of the Hindus which has become the cheapest for slaughter.
('38', 46, 1, 10, 104051) To this end I suggest the following: (1) The State should in the open market buy out every [head of] cattle offered for sale by outbidding every other buyer.
('38', 46, 1, 11, 104209) (2) The State should run dairies in all principal towns ensuring a cheap supply of milk.
('38', 46, 1, 12, 104298) (3) The State should run tanneries where the hides, bones, etc., of all dead cattle in its possession should be utilized and should offer to buy again in the open market all privately owned dead cattle.
('38', 46, 1, 13, 104501) (4) The State should keep model cattle farms and instruct the people in the art of breeding and keeping cattle.
('38', 46, 1, 14, 104613) (5) The State should make liberal provision .

('38', 47, 3, 4, 104836) DEAR FRIEND1, Your letter written on Christmas Day has followed me in my travels and I am able to overtake it only today.
('38', 47, 3, 5, 104958) I would ask you to believe me when I tell you that I have nothing against General Dyer or even Sir Michael ODwyer.
('38', 47, 3, 6, 105073) 2 They were both creatures 3 and symp toms of a deep seated disease of which I had not sufficient knowledge when I pleaded for co operation at Amritsar.
('38', 47, 3, 7, 105226) Whatever force there was in my plea was in my honest belief behind it.
('38', 47, 3, 8, 105297) The Rowlatt Act and the subsequent events having opened my eyes, I cannot summon to my aid the fervour of Amritsar.
('38', 47, 3, 9, 105413) My belief is shaken.
('38', 47, 3, 10, 105434) Nothing has happened to restore it, though I am eager for its restoration.
('38', 47, 3, 11, 105509) It gives me no pleasure to disbelieve men and measures.
('38', 47, 3, 12, 105565) But I shall be false if I shut my eyes to facts as I see them.
('38', 47, 3, 13, 105628) I think that non co operation is a fundamental fact in Gods plan, even as darkness is.
('38', 47, 3, 14, 105715) There is no such thing as co operation if there is no non co operation.
('38', 47, 3, 15, 105787) 4 If we give our co operation for the prosecution of that which is good, we must withdraw it from that which is evil.
('38', 47, 3, 16, 105905) I believe that the present British administration of India is on the whole not good but positively evil.

('38', 47, 4, 19, 106225) 2 Harvey had referred to a meeting at Bombay on December 21, at which Sir Chimanlal Setalwad and Jinnah had urged the policy of back to Amritsar , whereas Gandhiji, he recalled, has persuaded the Congress at Amritsar to adopt a policy of moderation and co operation.
('38', 47, 4, 20, 106492) Harvey had observed that Worse things were done on the nationalist side than that of the Government.
('38', 47, 5, 21, 106593) 3 The source has preachers.
('38', 47, 5, 22, 106621) 4 Criticizing the policy of non co operation as not being right in the light of the universal religion, Harvey had commended the policy of co operation, of friendly discussion, of getting together to talk over things, to explain viewpoints, quietly, sincerely and with desire to understand, as so ably exemplified by such men as Lord Reading, Lord Irwin.
('38', 47, 5, 23, 106976) Further, Harvey had described the policy of non co operation as not only negative and therefore barren, not only politically wrong, but also irreligious, contrary to the will of God.
('38', 47, 5, 24, 107159) He had appealed to Gandhiji to ponder over these words so that you may perhaps be helpful to them to give a right lead (S.N. 12094).

('38', 48, 6, 15, 108577) I could certainly call myself a votary of non violence, if in spite of the consciousness that I kill thousands of invisible creatures, I incessantly long to be free from the necessity of so killing and avoid every occasion possible for so doing.

('38', 49, 2, 3, 109270) January 12, 1927
('38', 49, 3, 4, 109287) He said that on an enquiry from Babu Rajendra Prasad about the inclement weather he had come to know that rains even in winter were not quite unusual in the province and that that was to some extent necessary too.
('38', 49, 3, 5, 109501) He was no doubt conscious of the immense difficulties the audience had to face on account of the rain; his own difficulties were no less.
('38', 49, 3, 6, 109639) But he was capable of working in the midst of all sorts of difficulties, his life had been only a prolonged story of his fight with difficulties of every description.
('38', 49, 4, 7, 109806) After announcing the meeting to be addressed by him at six next evening, he proceeded to explain the purpose of his visit.
('38', 49, 4, 8, 109929) He said that they were perhaps aware that his tour was specially intended to preach the message of the charkha and khaddar.
('38', 49, 4, 9, 110053) He admitted that there was enough field in the country for other activities with a view to the attainment of swaraj but he had taken to the charkha because he had found that that could be prescribed with equal force for allHindus and Muslims, males and females, men and boys, touchables and untouchables.
('38', 49, 4, 10, 110358) The charkha was the universal thing and as such it was to be taken up by all according to the capacity of each individual.
('38', 49, 4, 11, 110481) Working at the wheel was the sacred business of every Indian; everyone was required to join this universal yajna.
('38', 49, 4, 12, 110595) But if that was not possible for all, they could do one thing.
('38', 49, 4, 13, 110658) They could at least put on khaddar.
('38', 49, 5, 14, 110694) Continuing, he said that khaddar work to be conducted on a large scale throughout India demanded a large sum of money to be spent over it.
('38', 49, 5, 15, 110833) That money was to be supplied by the country.
('38', 49, 5, 16, 110879) Nearly 16 lakhs were already collected and spent and as a result, nearly 50 thousand women who had formerly nothing to do, and about 4,000 men who also formerly had alomst nothing to do, had got employment.
('38', 49, 5, 17, 111086) Weavers, many of whom were compelled to give up their profession on account of hard competition with Lancashire weavers, had once more found occupation, while large sums had already gone to the carders and ginners.
('38', 49, 5, 18, 111301) Spinning, therefore, was the saviour of the poor, while the middle class men also could derive much benefit from it.
('38', 49, 5, 19, 111418) Without humbly approaching the Government, without supplicating the rich, middle class young men could solve a good deal of their unemployment problem by taking to the charkha.
('38', 49, 5, 20, 111595) Riches were of course not to be expected from this work, but young men could very well earn an honest living by reverting to khaddar work.
('38', 49, 6, 21, 111734) Proceeding, he said that the fund, for which he was appealing for money, was called Deshbandhu Memorial Fund, started to commemorate the sacred memory of the late Deshbandhu.
('38', 49, 6, 22, 111909) Khaddar was very dear to his heart.
('38', 49, 6, 23, 111945) He had realized that the charkha was the thing for the whole of India and through that alone one could approach the masses for village reconstruction work which was the unrealized dream of his life.
('38', 49, 7, 24, 112144) 1 The meeting was held in a local hall.
('38', 50, 0, 1, 112184) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 51
('38', 50, 1, 2, 112226) few days before his death, he had expressed his wish to the speaker to accompany him (Mahatmaji) on his tour for khaddar work.
('38', 50, 1, 3, 112353) But man proposes God disposes.
('38', 50, 1, 4, 112384) Before he could begin to work according to his plan, he was snatched away by the cruel hand of death.
('38', 50, 1, 5, 112486) It was in order to fulfil his last wish, said Mahatmaji, that the All India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund, to be utilized by the All India Spinners Association, was inaugurated.
('38', 50, 1, 6, 112659) He referred to the circumstances under which the All Bengal Deshbandhu Memorial Fund was allowed to be spent over the Hospital, while at the very time he had appealed for money for the All India Memorial Fund for khaddar work.
('38', 50, 1, 7, 112886) It was time, said the speaker, that each one of them contributed his quota to fulfil the last wishes of Deshbandhu.
('38', 50, 1, 8, 113002) By contributing to this fund the donor might serve two useful purposes at the same time; firstly they would honour the sacred memory of Deshbandhu who lived and died for them, and, secondly, they would be helping the poor with work and money.
('38', 50, 2, 9, 113245) Proceeding, Mahatmaji said that to purchase one yard of khaddar was to help the poor men of their country to the extent of about four annas, whereas spending money over foreign cloth was to send the same abroad to the untold miseries of their own people.
('38', 50, 2, 10, 113500) To purchase Indian mill made cloth did not mean helping the poor, for it was the capitalists who used to enjoy the largest amount of profit, doling out a negligible amount to the labourers, which was not sufficient for them even to keep their body and soul together.
('38', 50, 2, 11, 113767) Three fourths of the money spent over Indian mill made cloths, said the speaker, filled the already overflowing coffers of the capitalists, while the labourers who were really in need of money did not get collectively more than one fourth of the profit.
('38', 50, 2, 12, 114021) The charkha was the only effective weapon to fight the poverty of the country to a successful close.
('38', 50, 3, 13, 114122) Mahatmaji then appealed for money.
('38', 50, 3, 14, 114157) He wanted everyone present to contribute his mite for this noble work and asked them to send the money to the proper authority if they had not it with them at that time.
('38', 50, 3, 15, 114327) He exhorted the audience to solemnly promise in that hall to put on khaddar habitually for all time to come.
('38', 50, 3, 16, 114436) He said that he would ask them even to burn their foreign clothes, if they had any.
('38', 50, 3, 17, 114520) But if they could not go so far as that, they must henceforward boycott all foreign clothes without the least hesitation.
('38', 50, 3, 18, 114642) Khaddar had become the burning passion of his life because he had found that and that alone could give food to the poor.
('38', 50, 3, 19, 114763) People might call him mad, but he could not give up that work for anything.
('38', 50, 3, 20, 114839) He asked everyone present in that hall to pay what little he could.
('38', 50, 3, 21, 114907) He did not want that people should pay money out of fear or shame; he wanted every one of them to feel the nobility of the cause and then do whatever lay in his power.
('38', 50, 4, 22, 115075) Referring to untouchability, he said that that was greatest blot upon Hindu society and that should be wiped out at the soonest possible date.
('38', 50, 4, 23, 115218) Hinduism never taught one man to consider another man as untouchable.
('38', 50, 4, 24, 115288) By observing the custom of
('38', 51, 0, 1, 115315) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 51, 1, 2, 115356) untouchability, Hindus were committing a sin.
('38', 51, 1, 3, 115402) Swami Shraddhanand gave his life for the sake of the removal of untouchability.
('38', 51, 1, 4, 115482) It was their duty to take up that work of service to the poor and the untouchables.
('38', 51, 2, 5, 115566) Incidentally he referred to the Hindu Muslim tension and deplored the murder of Swamiji.
('38', 51, 2, 6, 115655) But Sawamijis death could be turned to good account, if both the Hindus and the Muslims cleansed their hearts with his blood.
('38', 51, 2, 7, 115781) That would be the work of purfication, that would be a real shuddhi work.
('38', 51, 2, 8, 115855) What was the duty of the Hindus?
('38', 51, 3, 9, 115888) should not seek to retaliate.
('38', 51, 3, 10, 115918) The teaching of all religions was not to return evil for evil but good for evil.
('38', 51, 3, 11, 115999) All the religions taught that the greatest conquest was the conquest of ones own self.
('38', 51, 3, 12, 116086) The Hindus should attain that self possession.
('38', 51, 3, 13, 116133) Abdul Rashid was a poor creature; he alone was not responsible for this diabolical deed.
('38', 51, 3, 14, 116222) The bulk of the Muslim Press in Delhi and all those who had been holding up Swami Shraddhanand, Lala Lajpat Rai and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya as the enemies of Islam collectively contributed to the murder.
('38', 51, 3, 15, 116430) The results of those things were before them.
('38', 51, 3, 16, 116476) The whole atmosphere of the country demanded purificatin.
('38', 51, 3, 17, 116534) Enthusiasm like that of 1922 was necessary for their success in the battle they had undertaken, but that could not come until the process of purification had reached its completion.
('38', 51, 3, 18, 116716) Everyone should, therefore, concentrate all his attention upon self purification.
('38', 51, 3, 19, 116798) It was wholly unwise to be inimical to the enemies, one should rather pity them.

('38', 51, 4, 21, 116906) 40. INDEPENDENCE
('38', 51, 5, 22, 116923) Year after year a resolution is moved in the Congress to amend the Congress creed so as to define swaraj as complete independence and year after year happily the Congress throws out the resolution by an overwhelming majority.
('38', 51, 5, 23, 117149) The rejection of the resolution is proof of the sanity of the Congress.
('38', 51, 5, 24, 117221) The moving of the resolution betrays the impatience (pardonable in the circumstances) of some ardent Con gressmen who have lost all faith in the British intentions and who think that the British Government will never render justice to India.
('38', 51, 5, 25, 117463) The advocates of independence forget that they betray want of faith in human nature and therefore in themselves.
('38', 51, 5, 26, 117576) Why do they think that there can never be change of heart in those who are guiding the British people?
('38', 51, 5, 27, 117679) Is it not more correct and more dignified to own that there is no change of heart because we are weak?
('38', 51, 5, 28, 117782) Nature abhors weakness.
('38', 51, 5, 29, 117806) We want from the British people and the world at large not mercy but justice that is our due.
('38', 51, 5, 30, 117900) And justice will come when it is deserved by our being and feeling strong.
('38', 52, 0, 1, 117975) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 53
('38', 52, 1, 2, 118017) I am sure that the staunchest votary of independence does not mean that he will not have any British association on any terms whatsoever.
('38', 52, 1, 3, 118155) Even when he says so, he means, as one of the supporters of the resolution admitted in answer to my question, that the British people will never accept association on equal terms.
('38', 52, 1, 4, 118335) This is totally different from rejecting British association on any terms.
('38', 52, 1, 5, 118410) Indeed the word swaraj is all embracing.
('38', 52, 1, 6, 118451) It does include comp lete independence as it includes many other things.
('38', 52, 1, 7, 118524) To give it one definite meaning is to narrow the outlook, and to limit what is at present happily limitless.
('38', 52, 1, 8, 118633) Let the content of swaraj grow with the growth of national consciousness and aspirations.
('38', 52, 1, 9, 118723) We may be satisfied today with dominion status.
('38', 52, 1, 10, 118771) The future generations may not be, may want something better.
('38', 52, 1, 11, 118833) Swaraj without any qualifying clause includes that which is better than the best one can conceive or have today.
('38', 52, 1, 12, 118946) Swaraj means even under dominion status a capacity to declare independence at will.
('38', 52, 1, 13, 119030) So long as we have not achieved that capacity, we have no swaraj.
('38', 52, 1, 14, 119096) This is the least it should mean.
('38', 52, 1, 15, 119130) South Africa has achieved that status today.
('38', 52, 1, 16, 119175) It is a partnership at will of free peoples.
('38', 52, 1, 17, 119220) Between Britain and the Dominions there is a partnership at will on terms of equality and for mutual benefit.
('38', 52, 1, 18, 119330) What India will finally have is for her and her alone to determine.
('38', 52, 1, 19, 119398) This power of determination remains unfettered by the existing creed.
('38', 52, 1, 20, 119468) What therefore the creed does retain is the possibility of evolution of swaraj within the British Empire or call it the British Commonwealth.
('38', 52, 1, 21, 119610) The cryptic meaning of swaraj I have often described to be within the Empire if possible, with out if necessary.
('38', 52, 1, 22, 119723) I venture to think that it is not possible to im prove upon that conception.
('38', 52, 1, 23, 119800) It is totally consistent with national self respect and it provides for the highest growth of the nation.
('38', 52, 1, 24, 119906) After all, the real definition will be determined by our action, the means we adopt to achieve the goal.
('38', 52, 1, 25, 120011) If we would but concentrate upon the means, swaraj will take care of itself.
('38', 52, 1, 26, 120088) Our exploration should, therefore, take place in the direction of determining not the definition of an indefinable term like swaraj but in discovering the ways and means.

('38', 53, 2, 3, 120332) INDIANS IN PANAMA The Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Panama recently passed an Immigration Restriction Act prohibiting the entry of British Indians among others.
('38', 53, 2, 4, 120503) President Chiari had in a well considered message returned the Bill to the Assembly advising considerable amendments and reconsideration.
('38', 53, 2, 5, 120641) But the Assembly refused to make the amendments recommended except in matters that were inevitable.
('38', 53, 2, 6, 120741) The Assembly defended its restriction upon the liberty of British Indians on the ground of protection of the rights of posterity.
('38', 53, 2, 7, 120871) There are at present not more than perhaps thirity Sindhi Indian merchants of fancy goods.
('38', 53, 2, 8, 120962) It was acknowledged that their presence was no menace to the inhabitants of Panama.
('38', 53, 2, 9, 121046) Nevertheless the law is retrospective in its effect with the exception that those who can prove continuous previous domicile of ten years may receive exemption certificates.
('38', 53, 2, 10, 121220) I hardly think there are many settlers there who can prove continuous residence in Panama for such a long period.
('38', 53, 2, 11, 121334) If African experience is any guide, Indian settlers abroad are not in the habit of staying out of India for such a long period.
('38', 53, 2, 12, 121462) The matter is now, I understand, before the Foreign Office.
('38', 53, 2, 13, 121522) It remains to be seen how far that office is able to protect the rights of the resident Indian popu lation and of those who may choose to emigrate to Panama in search of an honest livelihood.

('38', 54, 2, 3, 121934) January 13, 1927
('38', 54, 3, 4, 121951) Mahatma Gandhi in replying thanked the commissioners for the welcome addresses they had presented him.
('38', 54, 3, 5, 122054) He thanked particularly the commissioners of the Municipality for frankly confessing that khaddar and charkha were not much in use in the jurisdiction of their municipality.
('38', 54, 3, 6, 122228) He said that he used to take keen interest in municipal affairs even when he was in South Africa.
('38', 54, 3, 7, 122326) He knew that towns played a prominent part in the affairs of the country and that almost all movements in the modern world sprang from the towns.
('38', 54, 3, 8, 122472) He was aware further that sense of civic responsibility was to be awakened in their young men.
('38', 54, 3, 9, 122567) But in the peculiar condition of India, towns were at the most only of secondary importance.
('38', 54, 3, 10, 122660) India lived in villages and towns, sank into insignificance when compared with seven lakhs of villages.
('38', 54, 3, 11, 122764) This importance of village life in India was not to be lost sight of by the commissioners of the municipalities.
('38', 54, 3, 12, 122877) There was a growing tendency in this country on the part of the educated men to cut off all their connection with villages and wipe them out of their memory.
('38', 54, 3, 13, 123035) This tendency was to be checked.
('38', 54, 3, 14, 123068) In Europe the villages depended for everything upon the towns which were the centres of all sorts of activites.
('38', 54, 3, 15, 123180) But in India it was the villages which nourished the towns and as such it was the duty of every townsman to see that the healthy growth of the villagers was not interfered with in any way.
('38', 54, 3, 16, 123369) One wondered how India could be so poor in spite of her exports exceeding her imports.
('38', 54, 3, 17, 123456) The reason was that crores of rupees went out of this country to add to the prosperity of other people while the majority of their own men did not know what it was to have two full meals a day.
('38', 54, 3, 18, 123650) Whatever little money was left in this country went to the coffers of merchants and middle men.
('38', 54, 3, 19, 123746) He (Mahatmaji) did not envy their lot but the poor villages were not to be forgotten.
('38', 54, 3, 20, 123832) They themselves were starving while they were supplying the townspeople not only with food but also with other luxuries.
('38', 54, 3, 21, 123953) It was to find out a few morsels of food for these hungry millions that he was asking them to take to the charkha.
('38', 54, 3, 22, 124068) The poor, weak, miserable villagers could eat and live if only they all used khaddar in preference to all other cloth.
('38', 54, 3, 23, 124187) He wished them all to work at the charkha as a sacred duty but if they could not do so they could wear khaddar at least.
('38', 54, 3, 24, 124308) He said that he was glad that they had introduced spinning on a small scale in their jurisdiction but the work remained still incomplete.
('38', 54, 3, 25, 124446) All their activities would remain incomplete until they perfected the khaddar organization.
('38', 54, 3, 26, 124538) He himself would not be satisfied till then.
('38', 54, 3, 27, 124583) To work for khaddar was to work for the poor.
('38', 54, 4, 28, 124629) 1 At the meeting, held in the morning in the Dhanbad town hall, Gandhiji was presented addresses by the Dhanbad Municipality and the Local Board.
('38', 54, 4, 29, 124775) Gandhiji addressed altogether five meetings at Dhanbad, Jharia and other places.
('38', 55, 0, 1, 124856) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 55, 1, 2, 124897) That was why he had been devoting all his time and energy to the work.
('38', 55, 1, 3, 124968) It was their duty to take up that work for the sake of the poor, for the country and for God.
('38', 55, 2, 4, 125062) Concluding, he thanked them once more for the warm reception they had accorded him.

('38', 55, 4, 7, 125212) January 13, 1927
('38', 55, 5, 8, 125229) He said that he was glad to see them there .
('38', 55, 5, 9, 125274) Last time when he was at Jharia, he had no opportunity to go to that place [Katras].
('38', 55, 5, 10, 125359) Jharia, he said, was a place which attracted people, both capitalists and labourers, from all parts of India.
('38', 55, 5, 11, 125469) Labourers were the chief inhabitants of that place and as such he wanted to speak a few words to them.
('38', 55, 6, 12, 125572) Continuing, he said that he used to call himself also a labourer.
('38', 55, 6, 13, 125638) If anybody enquired about his calling, he used to say that he was a weaver, or a cultivator.
('38', 55, 6, 14, 125731) He would rather like to be called a scavenger.
('38', 55, 6, 15, 125778) The profession of a scavenger was not to be looked down upon.
('38', 55, 6, 16, 125840) He did a great benefit to human society.
('38', 55, 6, 17, 125881) His profession was to cleanse the most dirty portion of a house.
('38', 55, 6, 18, 125946) Society was, therefore, highly indebted to him.
('38', 55, 6, 19, 125994) His was a profession of service and it was unwise to consider him low.
('38', 55, 6, 20, 126065) His (speakers) mother, in fact, every mother, did the same thing as a scavenger.
('38', 55, 6, 21, 126146) Did they hate their mothers for that reason?
('38', 55, 6, 22, 126191) If his own mother had not done the work of a scavenger for him in his boyhood, he could not have lived so long and come in their midst to address them.
('38', 55, 6, 23, 126343) It was not due to the profession that a scavenger should be looked down upon.
('38', 55, 6, 24, 126421) Unless the heart of a man was dirty, there was no reason why he should be considered low, no matter how low his profession might be.
('38', 55, 6, 25, 126554) His appeal, therefore, to the scavengers as a matter of fact, to all labourers, was that they should begin to cleanse themselves simultaneously with cleansing the household of other persons.
('38', 55, 6, 26, 126745) He was aware that the labourers were addicted to drinking, gambling, smoking and other evil habits.
('38', 55, 6, 27, 126845) They must be free of all these vices.
('38', 55, 6, 28, 126883) He was in favour of total prohibition, but as long as that could not be achieved, they should themselves try to get rid of that pernicious habit.
('38', 55, 6, 29, 127029) Credit lay in a mans abstinence in the midst of all sorts of temptations.
('38', 55, 6, 30, 127103) He appealed to them to give up drinking for Gods sake as well as for their own sake.
('38', 55, 7, 31, 127188) Referring to gambling, he said that was a most vicious practice.
('38', 55, 7, 32, 127253) The Pandavas lost their all on that account.
('38', 55, 7, 33, 127298) But they recovered at last because they were on the side of truth.
('38', 55, 7, 34, 127365) Yudhishthira was himself repentant for what he did.
('38', 55, 7, 35, 127417) Referring to their lustful

('38', 56, 1, 2, 127605) habit, he said that he was aware that there were people who used to leave their wives and destroy their health and wealth after vile prostitutes.
('38', 56, 1, 3, 127751) That was a very bad habit.
('38', 56, 1, 4, 127778) All women, other than ones wife, were to be considered as sisters.
('38', 56, 2, 5, 127845) Smoking of bidi and ganja was also to be given up.
('38', 56, 2, 6, 127896) He could not understand why people smoked ganja.
('38', 56, 2, 7, 127945) He knew that even rich and learned men smoked cigarettes and bidis.
('38', 56, 2, 8, 128013) But that was no reason why they also should be addicted to the same.
('38', 56, 3, 9, 128082) was no reason why one man should be addicted to vicious habits because another man was used to them.
('38', 56, 3, 10, 128183) His appeal to even the educated men was that they should give up smoking.
('38', 56, 4, 11, 128257) Continuing, he said that labourers should remember that there were men who were poorer than them.
('38', 56, 4, 12, 128355) They (the labourers) had money to spend over wine, gambling, smoking and all that, but there were people in villages who could not get even sufficient food and clothing to keep themselves alive.
('38', 56, 4, 13, 128550) They could at least earn about 15 to 20 rupees, but their brothers in villages could seldom see the face of a pice.
('38', 56, 4, 14, 128666) Had they any feeling for them?
('38', 56, 4, 15, 128697) They themselves were poor.
('38', 56, 4, 16, 128724) Was it not very reasonable, then, that they should realize the miseries of those who were poorer than even them, he asked, If they felt like that, it was their duty to wear khaddar exclusively.
('38', 56, 4, 17, 128918) They should clothe themselves with khaddar woven with pure yarn spun by their poor sisters in villages.
('38', 56, 4, 18, 129022) Whatever they paid for khaddar was paid to those poor creatures.
('38', 56, 4, 19, 129087) Women who could not earn even a penny were earning about two annas a day each.
('38', 56, 4, 20, 129166) He was appealing to them for that money to be paid to their poor fellow beings.
('38', 56, 4, 21, 129246) They could help them with that money by wearing khaddar.
('38', 56, 4, 22, 129303) The law of God was that man should sympathize with his fellow creatures in distress.
('38', 56, 4, 23, 129388) He appealed, therefore, in Gods name to them to exclude all clothes except khaddar and help him with money in cash, no matter how little it was, to carry on that work.
('38', 56, 4, 24, 129556) Khaddar worth Rs. 96 thousand was produced in Bihar the previous year and about 60 thousand worth was sold within a period of six months.
('38', 56, 4, 25, 129694) All this money went to the homes of the poor.
('38', 56, 4, 26, 129740) A good deal of money was now spent over the selling of khaddar.
('38', 56, 4, 27, 129804) If they purchased khaddar as they purchased foreign cloth, much of that money could be saved and utilized for the purpose of production.
('38', 56, 4, 28, 129941) If they decided to do that, the entire amount of khaddar required in the country could be produced here without any difficulty.
('38', 56, 4, 29, 130069) What was necessary was their sympathy and support; would they deny that?
('38', 56, 5, 30, 130142) Addressing the ladies he said that, if they wanted swaraj, which term was synonymous with Ramraj, they should each be like Sita.
('38', 56, 5, 31, 130271) Sita was pure of heart, she kept her body clean by wearing hand spun and hand woven khaddar.
('38', 56, 5, 32, 130364) She lived at a time when the charkha was to be found in every household and every woman used to spin.
('38', 56, 5, 33, 130466) That time was to be revived again.
('38', 56, 5, 34, 130501) The charkha should even now find as important a place as the household hearth.
('38', 56, 6, 35, 130580) Addressing others, the Mahatma said that, if they wanted freedom they would have to undergo considerable sacrifice.
('38', 56, 6, 36, 130696) The minimum they could do was to put on
('38', 57, 0, 1, 130736) 58 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 57, 1, 2, 130777) khaddar.
('38', 57, 1, 3, 130786) The khaddar movement must receive their whole hearted support; they must render every possible financial support to that cause.
('38', 57, 1, 4, 130914) He then narrated the circumstances in which the All India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund was inaugurated and appealed to the audience to honour the sacred memory of the departed great by contributing to that fund.
('38', 57, 2, 5, 131122) Continuing, he said that the Deshbandhu Memorial Fund was to be utilized for the purpose of spreading khaddar.
('38', 57, 2, 6, 131233) They had already got some money for the Fund but the work they had undertaken demanded more and more money.
('38', 57, 2, 7, 131341) Sixty crores of rupees annually went out of the country; their aim was to keep that money here.
('38', 57, 2, 8, 131437) A huge sum was, therefore, to be spent over that.
('38', 57, 2, 9, 131487) Their task was great, but he hoped to fulfil it with their help.
('38', 57, 2, 10, 131552) Everyone could pay to that fund without any difficulty; even Government servants could contribute to that.
('38', 57, 2, 11, 131659) He hoped that he would not go disappointed from that place.
('38', 57, 3, 12, 131719) Referring to untouchability, he said that Swami Shraddhanand sacrificed his life for that cause, They should remove this blot at least for the sake of Swamiji.
('38', 57, 3, 13, 131879) Hinduism had nothing to do with that pernicious system.
('38', 57, 3, 14, 131935) The Gita never taught a man to consider another as untouchable.
('38', 57, 4, 15, 131999) Referring to Hindu Muslim unity, he said that both the communities were to go through the process of purification before they could hope to attain that unity.
('38', 57, 4, 16, 132158) To the Muslims, he said that, if anyone of them considered the murder of Swamiji as a praiseworthy act on the part of the murderer, it was a great mistake.
('38', 57, 4, 17, 132314) He claimed to be a sanatani Hindu, but he had studied the Koran with as much reverence as the Gita.
('38', 57, 4, 18, 132414) But he had nowhere found in the Koran any approval of such dastardly deeds.
('38', 57, 4, 19, 132490) On the contrary, there were passages there distinctly against violence.
('38', 57, 4, 20, 132562) If violence was to be committed, it was to be committed upon ones own self for the purpose of fighting the evils in oneself, not upon another person.
('38', 57, 4, 21, 132712) Hindus had become weak and cowardly; how could they expect to rise in spite of their weaknesses?
('38', 57, 4, 22, 132809) The real shuddhi work was the work of self purification and it was the duty of everyone of them to go through that process.
('38', 57, 4, 23, 132933) He prayed to God to help them in their work.
('38', 57, 5, 24, 132978) The Searchlight, 19 1 1927
('38', 57, 6, 25, 133005) 45. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, JHARIA 2
('38', 57, 7, 26, 133044) January 13, 1927
('38', 57, 8, 27, 133061) Mahatma Gandhi, in addressing the meeting, said that he was glad that the president of the Employees Association had complied with his request and did not read the address written in English.
('38', 57, 8, 28, 133253) He had received two addresses in the morning
('38', 57, 9, 29, 133298) 1 At the meeting, a purse of Rs. 885 was presented to Gandhiji and some money collected on the spot.
('38', 57, 9, 30, 133399) 2 At the meeting an address of welcome was presented to Gandhiji by the members of the Indian Colliery Employees Association, Jharia.
('38', 58, 0, 1, 133533) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 59
('38', 58, 1, 2, 133575) which were written in English .
('38', 58, 1, 3, 133607) But he objected to the third, because there were few people in the meeting who could understand that language.
('38', 58, 1, 4, 133718) He would have very much appreciated the address if it was written either in Hindi or in Bengali.
('38', 58, 1, 5, 133815) He had no quarrel with the English language; it was, indeed, a good language.
('38', 58, 1, 6, 133893) He claimed to have some knowledge of it.
('38', 58, 1, 7, 133934) If he had any ill feeling against the English language, he would not have conducted an English paper.
('38', 58, 1, 8, 134036) But all occasions were not favourable for using that language.
('38', 58, 1, 9, 134099) They had their lingua franca, that is, Hindi.
('38', 58, 1, 10, 134145) They could very well use that language on interprovincial matters no matter if it was faulty.
('38', 58, 1, 11, 134239) A man was not to be judged by his words, they were to see whether his heart was sincere.
('38', 58, 1, 12, 134328) He himself might speak grammatically incorrect Hindi, hut his motive was honest and that was enough to recommend his speech to them.
('38', 58, 2, 13, 134461) Continuing, he said that Jharia was a place where people, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Marwaris, Gujaratis, Bengalis, Biharis, in fact, people from all provinces of India flocked together.
('38', 58, 2, 14, 134657) He hoped that they all lived together on friendly terms without bearing ill will to anyone.
('38', 58, 3, 15, 134749) Proceeding, he narrated the havoc caused to India by imported cloth.
('38', 58, 3, 16, 134818) He said
('38', 58, 4, 17, 134826) that it was but natural and desirable that man should try to do good to all, irrespective
('38', 58, 5, 18, 134916) of their nationality and religion.
('38', 58, 5, 19, 134951) But is was monstrous for a man to help others in
('38', 58, 6, 20, 135000) such a way as to incur irreparable loss to his own house.
('38', 58, 6, 21, 135058) Why did they put on foreign
('38', 58, 7, 22, 135086) cloth then?
('38', 58, 7, 23, 135098) Was it to help the weavers of Manchester?
('38', 58, 7, 24, 135140) Certainly not.
('38', 58, 7, 25, 135155) The one answer
('38', 58, 8, 26, 135170) he had found to this question was that is was a fashion to put on foreign clothes and
('38', 58, 9, 27, 135256) that khaddar was rough and coarse.
('38', 58, 9, 28, 135291) But would they refuse the bread prepared by their
('38', 58, 10, 29, 135341) mothers if it was bad and go begging from door to door for the better bread?
('38', 58, 10, 30, 135418) Khaddar
('38', 58, 11, 31, 135426) was the gift of their motherland and therefore sacred to them.
('38', 58, 11, 32, 135489) They might demand of
('38', 58, 12, 33, 135510) their mothers for better bread; but, as long as that was not ready, they had no other
('38', 58, 13, 34, 135596) alternative but to take that contentedly.
('38', 58, 13, 35, 135638) Similarly, they might try to improve the
('38', 58, 14, 36, 135679) quality of khaddar but as long as that could not be done, they had to remain content
('38', 58, 15, 37, 135764) with what was available, no matter how coarse it was.
('38', 58, 16, 38, 135818) Proceeding, he said that a characteristic feature of Indian civilization was that a man was to help his fellowmen in distress.
('38', 58, 16, 39, 135945) By wearing khaddar, they could perform their religious duty, namely, helping the poor.
('38', 58, 16, 40, 136032) Their Gita taught them that a man who did not perform yajna committed sin thereby.
('38', 58, 16, 41, 136115) Spinning at the wheel was yajna for
('38', 58, 17, 42, 136151) them; a spinning wheel was to be kept in every household as a sacred altar.
('38', 58, 17, 43, 136227) He said that he was just coming from the local khadi Bhandar.
('38', 58, 17, 44, 136289) He had seen that khaddar worth only Rs. 1,000 was kept in stock in that shop and even that could not be consumed.
('38', 58, 17, 45, 136403) He did not know how many rupees worth of foreign cloth was sold in Jharia, but he was sure that the sale of foreign cloth exceeded that of khaddar many times.
('38', 58, 17, 46, 136562) It was a matter of great regret to him that even such a small khaddar shop could not be
('38', 59, 0, 1, 136650) 60 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 59, 1, 2, 136691) conducted in Jharia.
('38', 59, 1, 3, 136712) He appealed to all to make it a point to wear khaddar.
('38', 59, 1, 4, 136767) He requested them to solemnly promise to discard all foreign cloth and habitually wear khaddar.
('38', 59, 2, 5, 136863) Addressing the labourers, he asked them to observe temperance and put on khaddar in preference to all other cloth.
('38', 59, 2, 6, 136978) They would thereby be giving food and clothing to hundreds of their own hungry men and women who could not earn even a single pice for want of occupation.
('38', 59, 2, 7, 137133) Mahatmaji next touched upon untouchability and Hindu Muslim tension.
('38', 59, 3, 8, 137202) Replying to the address, he said that he was glad that the work of the association was improving and he congratulated the organizers on their success.
('38', 59, 3, 9, 137353) As to the second, namely, the relations between the capitalist and the labourer, he assured them that his sympathy was always with the poor labourers and that his aim was to establish harmony and peace between the employer and the employee.
('38', 59, 3, 10, 137594) He said that he had, of course, done something for the labourers of Jamshedpur but he was not fully aware of local conditions.
('38', 59, 3, 11, 137721) In Jamshedpur the leaders of the labourers included some of his own men and even his friend and brother, Mr. Andrews.
('38', 59, 3, 12, 137839) Nevertheless, if his help was at any time necessary, he would try to do what little he could.
('38', 59, 3, 13, 137933) He, of course, did not believe that all capitalists were bad and oppressive; on the contrary, he knew many who had really the good of the employees at heart.
('38', 59, 3, 14, 138091) He was for equal and legitimate rights for all.
('38', 59, 3, 15, 138139) He advised the labourers to be on the right path and said that he was sure that truth would triumph at last.
('38', 59, 3, 16, 138248) He concluded his speech by once more appealing for money.
('38', 59, 4, 17, 138306) The Searchlight, 19 1 1927
('38', 59, 5, 18, 138333) 46. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, AURANGABAD 2
('38', 59, 6, 19, 138376) January 14, 1927
('38', 59, 7, 20, 138393) He said that when he toured in Bihar on a previous occasion he had not the
('38', 59, 8, 21, 138468) opportunity to come to that place.
('38', 59, 8, 22, 138503) He was glad, therefore, to meet them there and
('38', 59, 9, 23, 138550) thanked them for coming over to that place from distant villages.
('38', 59, 9, 24, 138616) He said that his
('38', 59, 10, 25, 138633) visit was intended to appeal to them to do some little work for India and for
('38', 59, 11, 26, 138711) themselves and hoped that they would not disappoint him.
('38', 59, 12, 27, 138768) India, he said, was a poor country.
('38', 59, 12, 28, 138804) Those who lived in the towns could scarcely imagine how poor the villagers were; even those villagers who had come to the meeting did not know that there were men living in far off villages who were poorer than them even.
('38', 59, 12, 29, 139026) These poor people lived in woeful obscurity dragging somehow or
('38', 59, 13, 30, 139090) 1 At the end of the speech Gandhiji was presented a purse of Rs. 1,001. 2 About 10,000 people were present at the meeting which was held in the open maidan near the Dak Bungalow and which Gandhiji addressed for about half an hour.
('38', 60, 0, 1, 139321) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 61
('38', 60, 1, 2, 139363) other their miserable existence to a melancholy close.
('38', 60, 1, 3, 139418) The people of the towns depended for their livelihood upon the villagers who, in their turn, got money from those miserable creatures.
('38', 60, 1, 4, 139553) They produced wealth for the whole country, while they themselves had no means to keep their bodies and souls together.
('38', 60, 1, 5, 139673) The railways of India might bring some amount of wealth to a fortunate few, but they deprived the real producers of wealth of even their means of livelihood.
('38', 60, 1, 6, 139831) He appealed to them in the name of God for those poor, wretched and miserable villagers who were the very backbone of Indian society.
('38', 60, 2, 7, 139965) Continuing, he described how the imports of foreign cloth had contributed to the misery and poverty of their people and explained how a check on that unlimited import might give an effective check to the growing poverty of the country.
('38', 60, 2, 8, 140201) The most effective weapon he had devised to fight the course of such unnatural events was the spinning wheel and he said he had come to recommend that to them.
('38', 60, 2, 9, 140361) He was confident that if they could effectively boycott foreign cloth and take exclusively to khaddar, they could proceed a long way towards their goal, namely, swaraj.
('38', 60, 2, 10, 140530) But if the political significance of khaddar was not recognized, there were other grounds strong enough to recommend it.
('38', 60, 2, 11, 140651) If khaddar was not to be used as a political weapon, they might use it with a view to helping thousands of their poor countrymen.
('38', 60, 2, 12, 140781) The charkha, he said, was their Annapurna because it had the power to give food and drink to almost an unlimited number of poor men.
('38', 60, 2, 13, 140914) The poverty of their people was a universally recognized fact; even English chroniclers had in their books testified to the fact that there were thousands of people in India who did not know what it was to have two full meals a day.
('38', 60, 2, 14, 141147) He himself had seen with his own eyes in Orissa what he had so long read only in books.
('38', 60, 2, 15, 141235) People in Orissa were so poor that they had really no means of subsistence.
('38', 60, 2, 16, 141311) Was it not their duty to help them?he asked.
('38', 60, 2, 17, 141356) If they could not help them in any other way, they might help them by wearing khadi.
('38', 60, 2, 18, 141441) The work of khaddar could be done by all Hindus and Muslims, males and females, men and boys.
('38', 60, 2, 19, 141535) The Bengalis and the Punjabis, all could join this work and contribute their mite to its success.
('38', 60, 2, 20, 141633) There was no ban even upon Government servants in respect of wearing khadi.
('38', 60, 2, 21, 141709) Khaddar produced by their own brothers and sisters in the peaceful atmosphere of villages situated far off from the din and bustle of modern industrialism, deserved every sympathy and encouragement from them.
('38', 60, 2, 22, 141918) It was sanctified with their memories of the past; it was their religious duty to put on khaddar in preference to every other kind of cloth.
('38', 60, 3, 23, 142059) Continuing, he said that money spent on foreign cloth went into the pockets of the weavers of Manchester and Lancashire, while that spent over Indian mill made cloth filled the already full coffers of the Ahmedabad merchants.
('38', 60, 3, 24, 142285) It pained him to think that in spite of there being expert manufacturers in India, Indians had to pay so much money to foreign manufacturers.
('38', 60, 3, 25, 142427) The East India Company might have been responsible for the extinction of their industry during the first period of their reign.
('38', 60, 3, 26, 142555) They might have put an end to their textile industry by violence and their undesirable methods.
('38', 60, 3, 27, 142651) But who was responsible for the continuance of that state of things, he
('38', 61, 0, 1, 142723) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 61, 1, 2, 142764) If they even now began to patronize khaddar, Indian cloth might once more become the observed of all observers of the world.
('38', 61, 1, 3, 142889) They should take to spinning and khaddar as a means of prayashchitta.
('38', 61, 1, 4, 142959) Even the rich men should begin to spin, not for money, but for setting an example to the credulous and imitative people of the villages.
('38', 61, 1, 5, 143096) Hinduism strictly enjoined upon everyone to perform yajna.
('38', 61, 1, 6, 143155) Yajna was that which was performed not in the interest of ones own self, but in the interest of others.
('38', 61, 1, 7, 143259) In the present circumstances of India, no other work could be more beneficial to the poor villagers than spinning and it was therefore the best possible yajna for the Indians.
('38', 61, 2, 8, 143435) Proceeding, the Mahatma said that in Bihar alone they had distributed Rs. 29,000 and Rs. 36,000 among the spinners and weavers, respectively.
('38', 61, 2, 9, 143577) It seemed to him that the people of Bihar had love for khaddar, but if all of them had patronized it they might have distributed more wealth among the poor inhabitants of the province.
('38', 61, 2, 10, 143762) About one hundred years ago, Patna used to produce very fine khadi which was exported to foreign countries and the people of those countries used that cloth as an object of luxury.
('38', 61, 2, 11, 143943) The wheel had turned and India instead of exporting fine cloth to foreign countries consumed imported cloth worth crores of rupees and the people of India felt proud to wear fine foreign cloth.
('38', 61, 2, 12, 144137) They as people of Bihar mush remember the progress that the textile industry had made in Patna in the past and it was their duty to revive those good old days.
('38', 61, 2, 13, 144297) They could do so by patronizing khaddar in every possible manner.
('38', 61, 2, 14, 144363) Khaddar had made progress; fine khaddar was now available and the price also had considerably gone down as compared with what it was in 1921. If the people made adequate response it might still be made cheaper.
('38', 61, 3, 15, 144574) He then appealed for funds for the All India Spinners Association and then dealt with the problem of untouchability and the problem of Hindu Muslim unity.
('38', 61, 4, 16, 144729) He said that swaraj which had ever been the dream of his life had almost come in 1921 22. The real shuddhi work, namely, the process of purification, had begun at that time.
('38', 61, 4, 17, 144903) A wave of enthusiasm had swept over the country and that was why they could come almost near their goal.
('38', 61, 4, 18, 145008) The same chapter was to be repeated again, but that could not be done till dissensions and disunions kept them hopelessly divided.
('38', 61, 5, 19, 145139) Proceeding, he said that those who entered the Councils did it with the sincere desire of doing good to the country and they might do some good work as well.
('38', 61, 5, 20, 145297) But how many could go to the Councils and how many were there who had right of voting, he asked.
('38', 61, 5, 21, 145394) Sixty lakhs of voters did not constitute the whole of India; his aim was to raise the thirty crores of Indian people.
('38', 61, 5, 22, 145512) Khaddar, he believed, might serve as a link between the rich and the poor; the spinning wheel might bring about unity and harmony among the entire population of India.
('38', 61, 5, 23, 145680) He appealed once more to the people to contribute to the funds of the All India Spinners Association and prayed to God to help them in doing their duty.

('38', 62, 11, 15, 146403) Mahatmaji, speaking in Hindi, regretted that the address presented to him on behalf of the municipality was written in English.
('38', 62, 11, 16, 146531) He said that whenever he found an opportunity he had repeatedly asked the people to present him addresses either in the vernacular of their province or in the national language of India, namely, Hindi.
('38', 62, 11, 17, 146733) He had no spite against the English language; he himself used that language on special occasions, but it was undesirable that they should use it while addressing their own men.
('38', 62, 11, 18, 146910) He requested the municipality to use Hindi whenever they presented any address, not merely to himself, but to any other Indian leader.
('38', 62, 12, 19, 147045) Continuing, he said that Gaya was really a sacred place to the Hindus, a place of pilgrimage for them.
('38', 62, 12, 20, 147148) But it pained him to see the deplorable state of the roads of that sacred city which was frequented by people from all parts of the country.
('38', 62, 12, 21, 147289) He had occasion that morning to see some of the roads in Gaya.
('38', 62, 12, 22, 147352) They surpassed in dirtiness even the roads of Ahmedabad, which was an old city and home of many poor people,
('38', 62, 13, 23, 147461) 1 Of the Munnalal Library at Gaya 2 There was no Pausa Sud 12 in this year.
('38', 62, 13, 24, 147537) Gandhiji was in Gaya on January 15, 1927 which corresponded to Pausa Sud 13.
('38', 62, 14, 25, 147614) 3 At the meeting, Gandhiji was presented addresses by the Municipality and the District Board.
('38', 63, 0, 1, 147709) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 63, 1, 2, 147750) which fact might be an excuse for the municipality of that place.
('38', 63, 1, 3, 147816) He regretted to say that he had never before seen such dirty roads in any part of India.
('38', 63, 1, 4, 147905) Gaya, being a place of all India interest, its municipality ought to have been an ideal one, but he was sadly disappointed.
('38', 63, 1, 5, 148029) He said that the commissioners should be up and doing in reforming the municipal arrangements of that great city.
('38', 63, 1, 6, 148143) How could they do so?
('38', 63, 1, 7, 148165) In order to achieve that end, the commissioners should themselves take up the work.
('38', 63, 1, 8, 148249) Mere dependence upon paid sweepers and scavengers would not better the situation.
('38', 63, 1, 9, 148331) He would rather request the chairman and the commissioners of the Board to take the broomsticks and buckets of water themselves and proceed to cleanse the roads and latrines of the city.
('38', 63, 1, 10, 148518) Towns were of considerable importance to the development of a country.
('38', 63, 1, 11, 148589) Growth of civic responsibilities in the people was an urgent necessity for their political emancipation.
('38', 63, 1, 12, 148694) He said that the case of Gaya was not an exception.
('38', 63, 1, 13, 148746) There were many other municipalities in India which were guilty of such bad administration.
('38', 63, 1, 14, 148838) But the exceptional character of Gaya city demanded it to be free from these evils.
('38', 63, 1, 15, 148922) There was nothing to be ashamed of in sweeping the streets; he himself had done it in many places; he had done it even in Bihar, in Champaran.
('38', 63, 1, 16, 149065) He was no lover of Western civilization; he would rather oppose all Western influences which tended to injure the vital interests of India.
('38', 63, 1, 17, 149205) But he would welcome all that was good in Western culture.
('38', 63, 1, 18, 149264) In respect of municipal administration, they had much to learn from the Western people.
('38', 63, 1, 19, 149352) Glasgow and Birmingham were formerly as dirty as Gaya, or perhaps even worse.
('38', 63, 1, 20, 149430) But the way in which the municipal administrators of those two places had reformed them was worthy to be imitated by the municipal commissioners of India.
('38', 63, 1, 21, 149585) He hoped that the Gaya Municipality will be prompt in reforming the state of that city.
('38', 63, 2, 22, 149673) Continuing, he regretted that the Chairman of the Municipality did not inform him in the morning that he and his colleagues could not agree on two points, namely khaddar and removal of untouchability.
('38', 63, 2, 23, 149874) In that case he might make time to try to convince them on those two points.
('38', 63, 2, 24, 149951) If they wanted to create a link between them and the villagers, the charkha and khaddar were unavoidable for them.
('38', 63, 2, 25, 150066) As regards untouchability, he did not think that there was any necessity of arguing on that point, after the death of Swami Shraddhanand.
('38', 63, 2, 26, 150204) He claimed to be sanatani Hindu.
('38', 63, 2, 27, 150237) But he had never found any of the Hindu scriptures sanctioning untouchability in the form in which it was practised by them.
('38', 63, 2, 28, 150362) If untouchability was not removed, Hindu society might altogether perish in the near future.
('38', 63, 2, 29, 150455) There were only three religions in the world, namely, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism.
('38', 63, 2, 30, 150543) He would regard Buddhism and Sikhism as branches of Hinduism, as the Hindu Mahasabha had defined it.
('38', 63, 2, 31, 150644) But the mighty Hindu society was fast disintegrating.
('38', 63, 2, 32, 150698) Christianity and Islam, in fact, the entire non Hindu population of the world, were keenly watching the movements of the Hindu society.
('38', 63, 2, 33, 150834) If they wanted to justify their existence and revive their old glory, it was their clear duty to remove that blot from Hinduism.
('38', 63, 3, 34, 150963) He had received that morning a cable from Mr. Andrews.
('38', 63, 3, 35, 151018) If they continued to tyrannize upon the so called untouchables, how could they expect to receive proper treatment at the hands of the white men in South Africa?
('38', 63, 3, 36, 151179) Gokhale had rightly said
('38', 64, 0, 1, 151204) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 65
('38', 64, 1, 2, 151246) in one of his addresses that it was but quite natural that the white people should look down upon the Indians who so inhumanly treated certain sections of their own people.
('38', 64, 1, 3, 151419) So long as the removal of untouchability was not achieved and the khaddar movement was not made to succeed, all their works would remain incomplete.
('38', 64, 1, 4, 151568) Continuing, he thanked the District Board for taking up khaddar work, although he was sorry that spinning could not be made popular with school children.
('38', 64, 1, 5, 151722) He was not surprised, for he knew the habit of children.
('38', 64, 1, 6, 151779) In order to make them spin regularly, the teachers should have to spin themselves.
('38', 64, 1, 7, 151862) The example of teachers might prompt the students to cling to the charkha as a plaything and they might create wonders while playing with the same.
('38', 64, 1, 8, 152010) He reminded the people of the good old days of their textile industry and asked them to endeavour their best to bring back those days.
('38', 64, 1, 9, 152145) The Searchlight, 21 1 1927
('38', 64, 2, 10, 152172) 50. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, RAMNA 1
('38', 64, 3, 11, 152210) January 15, 1927
('38', 64, 4, 12, 152227) He said that he was reminded by the chairman of the municipality as well as by the president of the Hindu Sabha that Gaya was a sacred place of pilgrimage, hallowed by the association of Lord Buddha.
('38', 64, 4, 13, 152427) But it pained him to see the miserable state of the latrines and the roads of Gaya dirtier than those which he had ever seen in his life.
('38', 64, 4, 14, 152565) He said that he had reminded the commissioners of their duty, but, if the people had not developed sufficient sense of responsibility, it was impossible for the municipality to discharge its duty.
('38', 64, 4, 15, 152762) Where the people were alert, the commissioners could not neglect their duty, for it was in the hands of the people themselves to replace those commissioners by new and better ones.
('38', 64, 4, 16, 152943) He had advised the commissioners to sweep and cleanse the roads, he would advise all the people to join them in their work.
('38', 64, 4, 17, 153067) Keeping the roads clean was as much the duty of the citizens as of the scavengers; the latter could not discharge their duty if the former did not heartily co operate with them.
('38', 64, 5, 18, 153245) Referring to the Hindu Sabha address, he said he was glad that the Sabha was trying to free the Hindus of cowardice.
('38', 64, 5, 19, 153362) But he had found that the Hindus alone were not cowards.
('38', 64, 5, 20, 153419) Cowardice had become the attribute of Indians as a whole.
('38', 64, 5, 21, 153477) If they could get rid of this evil, there could be no power on earth to check their forward march.
('38', 64, 5, 22, 153576) He thanked the Hindu Sabha for working for khaddar and removal of untou chability.
('38', 64, 5, 23, 153659) Untouchability, he had told them on a former occasion, was no part of Hinduism.
('38', 64, 5, 24, 153739) They should hang down their head in shame before the world for indulging
('38', 64, 6, 25, 153812) 1 Over 10,000 people attended the meeting at which an address of welcome was presented to Gandhiji by the local Hindu Sabha.
('38', 65, 0, 1, 153937) 66 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 65, 1, 2, 153978) in that sin.
('38', 65, 1, 3, 153991) The Gita taught them that man should not differentiate between a Brahmin and a Chandal.
('38', 65, 1, 4, 154079) The interpretation which he would give to that verse was that man should serve both Brahmin and Chandal alike and hate none.
('38', 65, 1, 5, 154204) According to Hinduism, there were only four varnas; there could not be a fifth one.
('38', 65, 2, 6, 154288) Proceeding, he said that shuddhi with him was synonymous with atmashuddhi, self purification.
('38', 65, 2, 7, 154382) They would work this shuddhi by loving the untouchables.
('38', 65, 2, 8, 154439) Swami Shraddhanand had died for religion.
('38', 65, 2, 9, 154481) The one burning passion of his life had been the regeneration of the untouchables.
('38', 65, 2, 10, 154564) They should do away with that evil at least for the sake of the great Swami.
('38', 65, 2, 11, 154641) He (the Mahatma) had of course his honest difference of opinion with Swamiji with regard to shuddhi as he (Swamiji) understood it.
('38', 65, 2, 12, 154772) He said: 1 I have made no secret of the fact that I did not approve of all aspects of the shuddhi work.
('38', 65, 2, 13, 154876) After much prayerful study of the Hindu Shastras I have come to the conclusion that there is no room in them for conversion such as they have in Islam and Christianity.
('38', 65, 2, 14, 155045) I am also certain on a prayerful reading of the Koran that there is no warrant for the tabligh that is being promoted today.
('38', 65, 2, 15, 155170) It is possible that I may be mistaken.
('38', 65, 2, 16, 155209) Let God correct me in that case.
('38', 65, 2, 17, 155242) I for myself would love to protect my religion with tapascharyathe way of prayerful suffering which is the royal road to success in any noble object.
('38', 65, 2, 18, 155392) The real memorial that the Hindus can raise to Swamiji is to rid Hinduism of the curse of untouchability.
('38', 65, 2, 19, 155498) Let both Hindus and Mussalmans cleanse their hearts with the purifying blood of Swamijis sacrifice.
('38', 65, 2, 20, 155598) I must be free to read the Gita or the Koran of my own accord.
('38', 65, 2, 21, 155661) Why should a Hindu compel me to read the one or a Mussalman to read the other?
('38', 65, 2, 22, 155740) Why should I need a Christian to compel me to read the Bible?
('38', 65, 2, 23, 155802) No one may stand between a man and his religion or God.
('38', 65, 2, 24, 155858) He who has no inkling of religion, whose heart is arid and purifiedhow dare he purify (by proselytizing) others?
('38', 65, 2, 25, 155971) But that is my opinion.
('38', 65, 2, 26, 155995) And as I am a votary of liberty I have in spite of my opinion insisted that Shraddhanandji had as much right to propagate the Vedic dharma as a Mussalman to propagate that of the Koran.
('38', 65, 2, 27, 156181) And if Shraddhanandji was assassinated for his shuddhi work, it did no credit to Islam.
('38', 65, 2, 28, 156269) Hinduism is proud of the sacrifice and has been enriched by it.
('38', 65, 2, 29, 156333) Let no Mussalman secretly approve of the act or believe that it has done any good to Islam.
('38', 65, 2, 30, 156425) Let not a single Hindu harbour any thought of retaliation.
('38', 65, 2, 31, 156484) If the Hindu and the Mussalman rid themselves of mutual distrust and fear, there is no power that can stop their freedom.
('38', 65, 3, 32, 156606) 1 The paragraph that follows has been extracted from Mahadev Desais Wee kly Letter in Young India.

('38', 66, 1, 2, 156747) the makers of our own slavery.
('38', 66, 1, 3, 156778) I had sealed my lips up to now on this burning topic.
('38', 66, 1, 4, 156832) It is Shraddhanandjis sacrifice that has compelled me to open them to a certain extent.
('38', 66, 1, 5, 156920) But I can give no guidance in this atmosphere.
('38', 66, 1, 6, 156967) I shall only send my prayers to God that He may rid us of fear and hatred and distrust, and make us rely solely on the strength of love.
('38', 66, 2, 7, 157104) Referring to the protection of cows, he observed that it was a non controversial matter and he was glad that they were doing so.
('38', 66, 2, 8, 157233) The Hindus themselves were responsible for the present condition of Indian cows.
('38', 66, 2, 9, 157314) If they did not sell their cows to the butchers for money, if they took proper care of the milch cows, their condition could not be so deplorable.
('38', 66, 2, 10, 157461) He had heard that there was a goshala in Gaya.
('38', 66, 3, 11, 157508) There were many such in India.
('38', 66, 3, 12, 157539) If they could properly conduct them, they could easily maintain old and decrepit cows out of the income derived from milk, milk products and hides of dead cows which could be made payable by establishing tanneries.
('38', 66, 4, 13, 157754) Continuing, Mahatmaji appealed to the people to help the poor villagers by habitually wearing khadi.
('38', 66, 4, 14, 157855) Charkha, he said, was their kamadhenu.
('38', 66, 4, 15, 157894) It had the power to
('38', 66, 5, 16, 157914) feed thousands of poor, starving villagers.
('38', 66, 5, 17, 157958) He regretted that even a small khaddar
('38', 66, 6, 18, 157997) shop could not be conducted in a town like Gaya.
('38', 66, 6, 19, 158046) It pained him to see a small khaddar
('38', 66, 7, 20, 158083) shop amidst a number of big shops full of foreign cloth.
('38', 66, 7, 21, 158140) He longed to see that day
('38', 66, 8, 22, 158166) when all the big shops in the market would be stocked with khaddar, while there
('38', 66, 9, 23, 158246) would remain only one or two small shops with foreign and Indian mill made cloth
('38', 66, 10, 24, 158327) and even those few not properly conducted.
('38', 66, 11, 25, 158370) Concluding, he appealed to the people in the name of God, to contribute what little they could to the Deshbandhu Memorial Fund for khaddar work and thus give financial help to the poor people of their country.

('38', 67, 6, 9, 159353) BHAISHRI DAHYABHAI, I got your letter.
('38', 67, 6, 10, 159392) There is no doubt that the condition of the cultivators is deteriorating in these times.
('38', 67, 6, 11, 159481) But the causes of that deterioration go deeper than you think.
('38', 67, 6, 12, 159544) Impatience will harm the cause.
('38', 67, 6, 13, 159576) Anger does not mend matters.
('38', 67, 6, 14, 159605) If you realize that the remedy lies not with the Government but with the cultivators, you will go ahead with your work without feeling unhappy all the time.
('38', 67, 6, 15, 159762) If I get even a moment free, I will write about the subject in Navajivan.
('38', 67, 6, 16, 159836) I got the cutting from the Prajabandhu 2. I did not get the one you say you sent before this.

('38', 68, 6, 12, 161220) Do you imagine she went about with Rama in his 14 years forest wanderings with heavy ornaments like you?
('38', 68, 6, 13, 161325) Do you think they add to your beauty?
('38', 68, 6, 14, 161363) Sita cared for the beauty of her heart and covered her body with pure khaddar.
('38', 68, 6, 15, 161442) The heavy ornaments you wear are not only ugly but harmful inasmuch as they are the permanent receptacles of dirt.
('38', 68, 6, 16, 161557) Free yourselves of these shackles and relieve the poverty of people who have no clothes, much less orna ments, to wear.

('38', 69, 2, 3, 162013) January 16, 1927
('38', 69, 3, 4, 162030) Mahatmaji made a joint reply.
('38', 69, 3, 5, 162060) After having thanked the Boards for kindly
('38', 69, 4, 6, 162103) presenting him the addresses, he said that although he would speak a few words on
('38', 69, 5, 7, 162185) other subjects also, his visit was mainly intended to preach the message of khaddar
('38', 69, 6, 8, 162269) and charkha.
('38', 69, 6, 9, 162282) He said that one of the addresses referred to his efforts to root out the
('38', 69, 7, 10, 162356) evil of untouchability.
('38', 69, 7, 11, 162380) It was the burning desire of his heart to wipe out that blot from
('38', 69, 8, 12, 162446) Hindu society.
('38', 69, 8, 13, 162461) Swami Shraddhanand, he said, who died in his attempts to do so, used
('38', 69, 9, 14, 162530) to say that unless one untouchable was kept as family member in the house of each
('38', 69, 10, 15, 162612) and every Indian leader, they could not say that untouchability was removed.
('38', 69, 10, 16, 162689) The fifth varna was their own creation; the Shastras never sanctioned it.
('38', 69, 10, 17, 162763) If the leaders kept the
('38', 69, 11, 18, 162787) untouchables in their houses, there was no reason why people should blame them.
('38', 69, 12, 19, 162867) Serve the untouchables was the lesson of Swami Shraddhanands life.
('38', 69, 12, 20, 162934) They should
('38', 69, 13, 21, 162946) learn further the lesson of fearlessness from his life and that of the evils of
('38', 69, 14, 22, 163026) communalism from his death.
('38', 69, 14, 23, 163054) He said that Hindu Muslim unity was a dire necessity
('38', 69, 15, 24, 163107) for them.
('38', 69, 15, 25, 163117) Unless that was attained they could not even dream of swaraj.
('38', 69, 16, 26, 163179) Continuing, he said that the poverty of their country was a universally admitted fact.
('38', 69, 16, 27, 163266) If they were true to their religion and true to their country, they could not but have sympathy with the poor.
('38', 69, 16, 28, 163377) The best way they could help the poor was by wearing khadi.
('38', 69, 16, 29, 163437) They should not spend even a cowrie over foreign or Indian mill made clothes.
('38', 69, 17, 30, 163515) He appealed once more to them to put on khaddar in preference to all other clothes.
('38', 69, 18, 31, 163599) He then announced that he would himself sell khaddar in that meeting, and, with a few pieces of Khadi in his hand, he stood on the dais and called for purchasers.

('38', 70, 1, 2, 164064) 56. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, SEWAN 1
('38', 70, 2, 3, 164102) [January 16, 1927] 2
('38', 70, 3, 4, 164123) I am glad you say that your sub division is better than other parts so far as Hindu Muslim unity is concerned.
('38', 70, 3, 5, 164234) But can you say that you are so united that your unity will stand the strain of anything happening elsewhere?
('38', 70, 3, 6, 164344) I wish there can be at least one province, one district, one sub division in this vast land which can proudly say that no power on earth can foment a Hindu Muslim quarrel there.
('38', 70, 3, 7, 164522) We may think we are living but disunited we are worse than dead.
('38', 70, 3, 8, 164587) The Hindu thinks that in quarrelling with the Mussalman he is benefiting Hindu ism, and the Mussalman thinks that in fighting a Hindu he is bene fiting Islam.
('38', 70, 3, 9, 164746) But each is ruining his faith.
('38', 70, 3, 10, 164777) And the poison has spread as among the members of the communities themselves.
('38', 70, 3, 11, 164855) And no wonder.
('38', 70, 3, 12, 164870) For one man cannot do right in one department of life whilst he is occupied in doing wrong in any other department.
('38', 70, 3, 13, 164986) Life is one indivisible whole.
('38', 70, 3, 14, 165017) I said at Comilla that the problem had passed out of human hands, and that God had taken it into His own.
('38', 70, 3, 15, 165123) Maybe the statement springs from my egotism.
('38', 70, 3, 16, 165168) But I do not think so.
('38', 70, 3, 17, 165191) I have ample reason for it.
('38', 70, 3, 18, 165219) With my hand on my breast, I can say that not a minute in my life am I forgetful of God.
('38', 70, 3, 19, 165308) For over twenty years I have been doing everything that I have done as in the presence of God.
('38', 70, 3, 20, 165403) Hindu Muslim unity I had made a mission of my life.
('38', 70, 3, 21, 165455) I worked for it in South Africa, I toiled for it here, I did penance for it, but God was not satisfied, God did not want me to take any credit for the work.
('38', 70, 3, 22, 165612) And so I have now washed my hands.
('38', 70, 3, 23, 165647) I am helpless.
('38', 70, 3, 24, 165662) I have exhausted all my effort.
('38', 70, 3, 25, 165694) But as I am a believer in God, as I never for a moment lose faith in Him, as I content myself with the joy and sorrow that He wills for me, I may feel helpless, but I never lose hope.
('38', 70, 3, 26, 165878) Something within me tells me that Hindu Muslim unity must come and will come sooner than we might dare to hope, that God will one day force it on us, in spite of ourselves.
('38', 70, 3, 27, 166051) That is why I said that it has passed into the hands of God.
('38', 70, 3, 28, 166112) This, I said, might be taken to be an arrogant utterancearrogant inasmuch as it implies that it is not in the power of any other man to
('38', 70, 4, 29, 166248) 1 Condensed summary of a speech delivered in Hindi 2 Sewan is a sub divisional town in the district of Saran, which, according to The Searchlight, 21 1 1927, Gandhiji covered on January 16.
('38', 71, 0, 1, 166438) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 71, 1, 2, 166479) achieve the work, as if no one has worked for it more than I. But there is no arrogance in the statement.
('38', 71, 1, 3, 166585) Hundreds may have done the work with the same earnestness, love and energy, but none with more.
('38', 71, 1, 4, 166681) And I believe that all of them must be feeling as helpless as I. In 1920, I said that not even the British Empire with all the resources of its armed strength, diplomacy and organization could efface us, make us slaves, or divide Hindus from Mussalmans.
('38', 71, 1, 5, 166935) But that was because I thought we were godfearing then.
('38', 71, 1, 6, 166991) We trusted one another and we relied on one anothers strength.
('38', 71, 1, 7, 167054) But how am I to prevail upon you today to cast off all fear, hatred and distrust?
('38', 71, 1, 8, 167136) Shraddhanandji was not the enemy of Mussalmans.
('38', 71, 1, 9, 167184) He was a warrior, he had the courage of his convictions.
('38', 71, 1, 10, 167241) Assassination was not the way to fight him.
('38', 71, 1, 11, 167285) Let us Hindus and Mussalmans both wash the sins of our heart with his blood.
('38', 71, 1, 12, 167362) And what is it that we should be fighting for?
('38', 71, 1, 13, 167409) We Hindus may be idol worshippers.
('38', 71, 1, 14, 167444) We may be mistaken.
('38', 71, 1, 15, 167464) But when God gave every man the right to make mistakes, when God suffers us to live although we are idol worshippers, why should not the Mussalmans suffer us too?
('38', 71, 1, 16, 167627) And if a Mussalman thinks that he must slaughter the cow, why should a Hindu stay his hands by force?
('38', 71, 1, 17, 167729) Why should he not fall on bended knees before him and plead with him?
('38', 71, 1, 18, 167799) But we will do no such thing.
('38', 71, 1, 19, 167829) Well then, God will one day make the Mussalman and the Hindu do what we will not do today.
('38', 71, 1, 20, 167920) If you are believers, I beseech you to retire into yourselves and pray to the In dweller to stay your hands from wrong and to make them do the right thing.
('38', 71, 1, 21, 168076) Let that be our prayer every morning and evening.
('38', 71, 1, 22, 168126) There is no other way.

('38', 71, 3, 25, 168195) January 17, 1927
('38', 71, 4, 26, 168212) MIRA, We are now on the north of the Ganges and therefore letters will for the time being take longer to reach you.
('38', 71, 4, 27, 168328) We are on Rajendra Babus ancestral property in a remote village 1 though not remote from the railway line.
('38', 71, 4, 28, 168435) What is your progress in Hindi now?
('38', 71, 4, 29, 168471) Are you speaking it with out reserve?
('38', 71, 4, 30, 168509) Do you get much time to talk in Hindi?

('38', 72, 1, 3, 168655) I hope you have continued your weekly Hindi letter to the Ashram.
('38', 72, 1, 4, 168721) It is fairly cold here.
('38', 72, 1, 5, 168745) It is never warm in the shade.
('38', 72, 1, 6, 168776) The weather is also damp but bracing.
('38', 72, 1, 7, 168814) One feels like walking all day long and yet I can get but little [time].
('38', 72, 1, 8, 168887) I am there somewhere about 20th March.
('38', 72, 1, 9, 168926) I suppose you would want to be there till then but in no case if the place does not suit you.
('38', 72, 1, 10, 169020) With love,
('38', 72, 3, 11, 169031) BAPU [PS.] I hope you have got the itinerary.
('38', 72, 3, 12, 169077) If not, address your letters Khadi Office, Muradpore, Patna.
('38', 72, 3, 13, 169138) It is incessant wandering.
('38', 72, 3, 14, 169165) By the [time you]r reply to this reaches me, it will be quite 10 days, I fear.
('38', 72, 3, 15, 169244) I reach Patna 30th inst.

('38', 72, 6, 18, 169347) Silence Day [January 17, 1927] 1
('38', 72, 7, 19, 169380) MANI, I got your letter.
('38', 72, 7, 20, 169405) There is nothing in your letter which you need keep back from others.
('38', 72, 7, 21, 169475) However, no one else except Mahadev has read it.
('38', 72, 7, 22, 169524) Surely, I will never force you to marry, nor will Father.
('38', 72, 7, 23, 169582) If I could have my way I would rather force girls to remain unmarried.
('38', 72, 7, 24, 169653) It is the girls themselves who compel me to force them to marry.
('38', 72, 7, 25, 169718) You are, therefore, safe so far as I am concerned.
('38', 72, 7, 26, 169769) I was being harassed by people who did not understand you and so I wrote to you to ascertain your desire and that too because I had observed your restlessness.
('38', 72, 7, 27, 169929) I do know of young women (girls) whose restlessness is due to their desire to get married, though they themselves are not aware of this.
('38', 72, 7, 28, 170066) I am sure that is cannot be so in your case.
('38', 72, 7, 29, 170111) Still it was my duty to draw your attention to the problem, and I also wished to suggest that there was no harm in thinking of getting married even after having expressed ones intention not to do so.
('38', 72, 7, 30, 170311) Of course it would be different if you had taken a vow.
('38', 72, 7, 31, 170367) In that case, the heavens may fall but the vow must not be violated.
('38', 72, 7, 32, 170436) Since, however, you have not taken a vow, even a person like me may ask you what you desire.
('38', 72, 7, 33, 170529) Others may even urge you to get

('38', 73, 0, 1, 170588) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 73, 1, 2, 170629) married.
('38', 73, 1, 3, 170638) This does not mean that I want you to take a vow.
('38', 73, 1, 4, 170688) That you may do when you feel that it is absolutely necessary.
('38', 73, 1, 5, 170751) I shall never feel compelled again to mention the subject of marriage to you; not only that, but I shall even prevent others from doing so.
('38', 73, 1, 6, 170891) You should, however, get over your restlessness and so live always that your unmarried state may win peoples respect.
('38', 73, 1, 7, 171009) Brahmacharya should be understood in a spiritual sense, and in order that it may bring you spiritual benefit, you should observe it in the manner recently complained by me in my autobiography in Navajivan.
('38', 73, 1, 8, 171215) You should, therefore, maintain a calm and cheerful temper, be industrious in your habits and cultivate a tolerant outlook.
('38', 73, 1, 9, 171339) Read Margopadeshika 1 several times over till you have mastered it.
('38', 73, 1, 10, 171407) Understand the meaning of every word in the Gita with the help of the rules explained in that book.
('38', 73, 1, 11, 171507) I have sent a wire to you asking you to master ginning and carding.
('38', 73, 1, 12, 171575) I have sent a wire to Narayandas too at Karachi.
('38', 73, 1, 13, 171624) But have not received a reply from him; whether or not I hear from him, I have received similar requests from others too.
('38', 73, 1, 14, 171746) I intend to send you to various places from time to time for teaching spinning.
('38', 73, 1, 15, 171826) I have asked for a salary of Rs. 50 and travelling expenses.
('38', 73, 1, 16, 171887) This will give you good experience too.
('38', 73, 1, 17, 171927) We shall think afterwards what to do then.
('38', 73, 1, 18, 171970) You should not take up any work there for the present.
('38', 73, 1, 19, 172025) You should, however, continue drawing Rs. 30/ .
('38', 73, 1, 20, 172073) You may save what you can from it.
('38', 73, 1, 21, 172108) I will ask for an account later on.

('38', 74, 2, 3, 172384) Silence Day, Pausa Sud 14 [January 17, 1927] 1
('38', 74, 3, 4, 172431) JAMNALAL, I have your letter.
('38', 74, 3, 5, 172461) I have sent you a telegram regarding the stores at Gondia and Amaravati.
('38', 74, 3, 6, 172534) If I have to visit Gondia, I may be able to go there too.
('38', 74, 3, 7, 172592) I have to leave Patna on the 31st evening.
('38', 74, 3, 8, 172635) I can catch the Bombay Mail at Mogulsarai on the 1st.
('38', 74, 3, 9, 172689) I shall be reaching Jabalpur .
('38', 74, 3, 10, 172720) 2 on the same day.
('38', 74, 3, 11, 172739) That means that I shall be arriving in Gondia on the 2nd.
('38', 74, 3, 12, 172797) I shall get a seat in the Bhusaval [Mail] at any rate on the 3rd.
('38', 74, 3, 13, 172863) Now about Manilal.
('38', 74, 3, 14, 172882) I have written to Kishorelal in that connec tion and have asked him to show the letter to you.
('38', 74, 3, 15, 172977) My suggestion just now is that either Gomatibehn or Vijayalakshmi should ask Sushila, without mentioning the name, whether she intends to get married.
('38', 74, 3, 16, 173128) I gather from Kishorelals letter that none of the girls is yet thinking of getting married.
('38', 74, 3, 17, 173220) If this is true, why should we persuade her to marry?
('38', 74, 3, 18, 173274) Kishorelal believes that, if at all, Sushila may be thinking of getting married.
('38', 74, 3, 19, 173355) That is why it seems to me that we can proceed further in the matter after ascertaining whether she wishes to get married.
('38', 74, 3, 20, 173478) Meanwhile I will definitely come there.
('38', 74, 3, 21, 173518) Perhaps we shall then know more clearly what to do.
('38', 74, 3, 22, 173570) My tour in these parts is going on at great speed .
('38', 74, 3, 23, 173622) 3 is arranged well.
('38', 74, 3, 24, 173642) Better arrangements .
('38', 74, 3, 25, 173664) 4 can be made though today we are in Rajendra Babus village.
('38', 74, 3, 26, 173725) Although Janakibehns complaint of piles has become less acute, it is better to consult a doctor and do as he suggests.
('38', 74, 3, 27, 173844) I should not like you to postpone consulting a doctor.
('38', 74, 3, 28, 173899) I hope Vinoba is keeping good health.

('38', 75, 3, 4, 174408) DEAR SISTERS, I have your letter.
('38', 75, 3, 5, 174442) I always write to you on Mondays; but as I keep moving from town to town, the day on which you receive my letters may vary.
('38', 75, 3, 6, 174566) Till now I was to the south of the Ganga.
('38', 75, 3, 7, 174608) Yesterday I came over to the north, crossing the river.
('38', 75, 3, 8, 174664) From Patna we crossed over to the other side by means of a boat.
('38', 75, 3, 9, 174729) A car awaited us there and took us to Sonepur.
('38', 75, 3, 10, 174776) Soil here is not sticky like mud; it has a mixture of sand in it.
('38', 75, 3, 11, 174842) It, therefore, feels soft to the feet like velvet.
('38', 75, 3, 12, 174893) Ba and I walked for about a mile.
('38', 75, 3, 13, 174927) We were not wearing sandals.
('38', 75, 3, 14, 174956) We liked to walk on the sand very much indeed.
('38', 75, 3, 15, 175003) Mother Ganga prepares new soil every year in this part of the country.
('38', 75, 3, 16, 175074) For hundreds of miles she carries mud and silt with her and, depositing them here, she runs along to the sea as though she wanted to avoid feeling embarrassed by being told by anyone of the great good she was doing to the land.
('38', 75, 3, 17, 175302) Today we are in Rajendra Babus village.
('38', 75, 3, 18, 175342) Rajbansi Devi is here.
('38', 75, 3, 19, 175365) Chandramukhi and Vidyavati are at present in Chhapra, the town where he (i.e., Rajendra Babu) lives.
('38', 75, 3, 20, 175466) We met them in Chhapra.
('38', 75, 3, 21, 175490) Both are in relatively good healthChandramukhi slightly worse than she was in the Ashram and Vidyavati slightly better.
('38', 75, 3, 22, 175610) In a womens meeting yesterday I started educating them on a new subject.
('38', 75, 3, 23, 175683) The women here wear heavy silver ornaments; they keep their children dirty and do not comb their hair.
('38', 75, 3, 24, 175786) I, therefore, criticized their habit of wearing ornaments.
('38', 75, 3, 25, 175845) The result was that some of them gave away their anklets, necklaces and so on to me, and promised that they would neither buy nor wear others in future.
('38', 75, 3, 26, 175998) While doing this, I thought of all of you.
('38', 75, 3, 27, 176041) Ba is giving me great help in this work, but that is because she agrees with me in this.
('38', 75, 3, 28, 176130) You can do work of this kind better than I. But that requires self sacrifice, enthusiasm, and opportunities.
('38', 75, 3, 29, 176239) All this you can have there.
('38', 75, 3, 30, 176268) Do we not sing atmavatsa rvabhuteshu 1?
('38', 75, 3, 31, 176308) We should regard all as ourselves.
('38', 75, 3, 32, 176343) Then, on finding somebodys children dirty, we would feel as if our own children were
('38', 75, 4, 33, 176428) 1 ( He sees rightly who) in all things sees himself.

('38', 76, 1, 2, 176523) dirty and so would feel ashamed; on finding someone else suffer would ourselves suffer and seek a remedy for the suffering.
('38', 76, 1, 3, 176647) But I have exceeded my limit.
('38', 76, 1, 4, 176677) Much as I like to exceed, I feel nervous when I look at the pile of correspondence lying before me.
('38', 76, 1, 5, 176777) Find out from a map where Patna, Sonepur, and Chhapra are situated.
('38', 76, 1, 6, 176845) This is the land where King Janaka lived.
('38', 76, 2, 7, 176887) Blessings from
('38', 76, 3, 8, 176902) BAPU [PS.] With whose permission did Gangabehn Zaveri let her foot be sprained?
('38', 76, 3, 9, 176982) Well, Gods will be done!
('38', 76, 3, 10, 177007) If one is negligent, one deserves punishment.

('38', 76, 6, 13, 177120) [January 18, 1927] 1
('38', 76, 7, 14, 177141) MIRA, I have two more letters from you.
('38', 76, 7, 15, 177181) Yes, you may go to Hardwar as soon as you wish.
('38', 76, 7, 16, 177229) You need not stay there for teaching carding and spinning unless it is a help to learning Hindi.
('38', 76, 7, 17, 177326) As you do not seem to be getting much Hindi, it is better to go away at once.
('38', 76, 7, 18, 177404) In no case must you endanger your health.
('38', 76, 7, 19, 177446) You will therefore judge for yourself and do what you think is best.
('38', 76, 7, 20, 177515) You will of course tell Vidyavati exactly as you feel.
('38', 76, 7, 21, 177570) Your letter about the assassination makes me sad.
('38', 76, 7, 22, 177620) I am hoping that you probably did not understand what your informers were saying or feeling.
('38', 76, 7, 23, 177713) Hatred is of course there or there would have been no strife.
('38', 76, 7, 24, 177775) But to think that youngsters can be infected makes one shudder.
('38', 76, 7, 25, 177839) Did you go to Swamijis house?
('38', 76, 7, 26, 177869) With love,

('38', 77, 1, 2, 177990) 62. KHADI IN BIHAR
('38', 77, 2, 3, 178009) Rajendra Prasad has sent me the report on the work of the Bihar branch of the A.I.S.A. for the year ending September 1926. It is a record of steady progress.
('38', 77, 2, 4, 178167) After mentioning the vicissitudes the organization had to pass through in the early stages, the report says: 1
('38', 77, 3, 5, 178278) There are 8 production and sale centres and 11 sale depots.
('38', 77, 3, 6, 178338) Besides these there are sale agencies at 6 places and more are being established.
('38', 77, 3, 7, 178420) The agency has 65 wholetime workers including two honorary workers.
('38', 77, 3, 8, 178488) Their average earnings are Rs. 25 per month.
('38', 77, 3, 9, 178533) During the year under review 2,698 spinners earned Rs. 29,519; 489 weavers, Rs. 36,862; 6 tailors, Rs. 230 during two months; 8 dyers and printers Rs. 2,273 during six months including the cost of dyes; and 40 washermen Rs. 1,951 during six months.
('38', 77, 3, 10, 178782) It goes without saying that the spinners and weavers too were not wholetime workers.
('38', 77, 3, 11, 178867) They worked only during their spare time and irregularly.
('38', 77, 3, 12, 178925) The report then says:
('38', 77, 4, 13, 178947) The progress that has been made is not only in regard to increased production and sale but also in regard to the quality of khaddar and reduction in its price.
('38', 77, 4, 14, 179107) The average price in 1923 was Rs. 1 0 5 per yard of fine cloth.
('38', 77, 4, 15, 179171) It was reduced to As.
('38', 77, 4, 16, 179193) 13 in 1926. When the yarn was very weak the weaving charge was 3 annas 3 pies per yard of 45 inches width.
('38', 77, 4, 17, 179300) On account of the improvement in the yarn, it has now been reduced to 2 annas 3 pies per yard of the same width.
('38', 77, 4, 18, 179413) Nor is there any difficulty about getting sufficient weavers to weave hand spun yarn.
('38', 77, 4, 19, 179499) Some of these weavers weave even up to 72 inches width and the variety of weaving includes twills, coatings of various designs, etc.
('38', 77, 4, 20, 179632) Dyeing and printing is being developed under the special care of a graduate of the Bihar Vidyapith.
('38', 77, 4, 21, 179732) The report, after mentioning the work in different branches of the organization, says:
('38', 77, 5, 22, 179819) If we could dispose of our present stock, it is expected that we shall be
('38', 77, 6, 23, 179893) able to reduce our prices still further by about 10 p.c.
('38', 77, 7, 24, 179950) 1 The statement, which gave figures of the production and sale of khaddar, is not reproduced here.
('38', 78, 0, 1, 180049) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 79
('38', 78, 1, 2, 180091) It naturally dwells upon the successful peripatetic exhibitions that were held during the year, of which a detailed account has appeared from time to time in these pages.
('38', 78, 1, 3, 180262) The interesting report contains the following pregnant reflections:
('38', 78, 2, 4, 180330) The province of Bihar is particularly suited for khaddar work.
('38', 78, 2, 5, 180393) The population is agricultural; there is no industry in the province worth the name, outside the coalfields of Chhotanagpur and apart from the great Tata Iron and Steel Works at Jamshedpur.
('38', 78, 2, 6, 180583) The tradition of spinning is still extant in most parts of it and the number of weavers and looms is large enough to supply almost the entire requirement of cloth of the province.
('38', 78, 2, 7, 180763) Cotton, though of an inferior quality, is also produced in many parts of it.
('38', 78, 2, 8, 180840) The work of production of khaddar is, therefore, not very difficult, although it requires organization and technical skill to improve its quality.
('38', 78, 2, 9, 180987) It can be extended almost indefinitely, if sufficient capital and organizing and technical skill are forthcoming.
('38', 78, 3, 10, 181101) The above narrative will show the progress made in reviving the ancient but practically all but dead industry of spinning in Bihar.
('38', 78, 3, 11, 181233) We have succeeded in touching but the merest fringe of the vast area in which spinning can be revived and made to furnish a much needed occupation for the idle hours of our great agricultural population.
('38', 78, 3, 12, 181437) That its possibilities are vast can hardly be denied.
('38', 78, 3, 13, 181491) That some supplementary occupation, not to speak of income, is necessary for the population will be apparent from the fact that the average quantity of land actually cultivated with food and non food crops is less than three quarters of an acre per head.
('38', 78, 3, 14, 181746) It is the yield of this small quantity of land, nearly four fifths of which are unirrigated and depend upon the freaks of the monsoon, that is expected not only to keep the body and soul together of every individual but also to supply him with cloth and other necessaries of life and to meet among others all demands of the zamindar, the society and the State.
('38', 78, 3, 15, 182107) Looked at from this point of view the admittedly scanty earning of 7 pies per day by charkha is not after all so small and does afford, as experience has shown, substantial relief to a class of people who need such relief but cannot get it through forced unemployment.
('38', 78, 3, 16, 182376) It is believed that agriculture does not require more than a hundred days labour in the year but the work is so distributed that the agriculturist cannot leave his farm and seek work elsewhere at a distance.
('38', 78, 3, 17, 182584) In fact, the nature of the work is such that it allows plenty of leisure but at short intervals and a supplementary industry, which is not capable of being taken up and put aside to be resumed later at the stage at which it was left, cannot be usefully taken up.
('38', 78, 3, 18, 182847) Experience has shown that the charkha alone can serve the purpose.
('38', 78, 3, 19, 182914) It is hoped that the appeal made in the report to the public for the purchase of khaddar will meet with the liberal response it deserves.

('38', 79, 1, 2, 183116) 63. HINDI V. ENGLISH
('38', 79, 2, 3, 183137) Organizers of meetings seem to require constant reminders that not English but Hindi or Hindustani is the common medium of expression among the masses.
('38', 79, 2, 4, 183289) I have observed that unlike as in 1921 the addresses hitherto presented to me during the tour have been in most cases in English.
('38', 79, 2, 5, 183419) The absurdity became patent when an address in English on behalf of the employees of Jharia collieries was sought to be read to me and that, at a big mass meeting attended by thousands, hardly fifty of whom could possibly understand English.
('38', 79, 2, 6, 183661) The vast majority could have easily followed Hindi and a very large number could have understood Bengali.
('38', 79, 2, 7, 183767) The officers of the associ ation were from Bengal.
('38', 79, 2, 8, 183818) If the English drafting was meant for me, it was wholly unnecessary.
('38', 79, 2, 9, 183887) They might have written the address in Bengali and given me a translation in Hindi or even in English.
('38', 79, 2, 10, 183990) But to inflict English on that big audience would have been an insult to them.
('38', 79, 2, 11, 184069) I hope that the time is coming when, if the proceedings are conducted in a language the majority cannot understand, they would leave such meetings.
('38', 79, 2, 12, 184217) Be it said to the credit of the chairman at this meeting that he saw the absurdity as soon as I drew his attention to it and very courteously allowed the address to be taken as read.
('38', 79, 2, 13, 184400) May the incident serve as a warning to all the organizers but more especially those in the Andhradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnatak.
('38', 79, 2, 14, 184536) I know their difficulty.
('38', 79, 2, 15, 184561) But they have had now for six years in their midst an efficient organization for the spread of Hindi.
('38', 79, 2, 16, 184663) Their addresses should be in the vernaculars of their respective provinces with a Hindi translation for my benefit.
('38', 79, 2, 17, 184779) I have always made an exception in Dravida land and delivered my speeches in English wherever they have so desired.
('38', 79, 2, 18, 184895) But I do think that the time has come when they should dispense with English for big public meetings.
('38', 79, 2, 19, 184997) Really it is the English speaking leaders who are blocking the way to our rapid progress among the masses by their refusal to learn Hindi which can be easily picked up inside of three months even in Dravida land, if the learners will give three hours per day.
('38', 79, 2, 20, 185257) Let those who doubt give a trial to the Hindi Prachar Karyalaya conducted in Madras under the aegis of the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Prayag.
('38', 79, 2, 21, 185396) They will find at the head office in Triplicane and the branches in Andhradesh and elsewhere books and teachers that will satisfy them.
('38', 79, 2, 22, 185532) There is no excuse save

('38', 80, 2, 4, 185750) ALL INDIA DESHBANDHU MEMORIAL
('38', 80, 3, 5, 185780) I hope the readers of Young India have not forgotten the All India Deshbandhu Memorial.
('38', 80, 3, 6, 185868) When I suspended touring after the Cawnpore Congress for one year, I knew that the collection of funds for the All India Deshbandhu Memorial to which I had pledged myself would be suspended.
('38', 80, 3, 7, 186059) But it was inevitable.
('38', 80, 3, 8, 186082) At the time of suspension I had stated that, if God willed it, at the end of the year I would resume my tour for the collection.
('38', 80, 3, 9, 186211) I resumed it at Calcutta and all the collections that I am now making will be for the All India Deshbandhu Memorial except where the donors otherwise specify the object of their donations.
('38', 80, 3, 10, 186400) And since the object of the All India Deshbandhu Memorial is village organization and that through the spinning movement, all these collections automatically become part of the All India Spinners Association which is the agency through which the Memorial collections are to be utilized for the purpose.
('38', 80, 3, 11, 186703) A resolution to this effect was passed by the All India Deshbandhu Memorial Committee at Cawnpore in 1925. I trust, therefore, that those who are in charge of the organization of meetings in connection with my tour will take good care to inform those who may attend meetings of the object of the tour.
('38', 80, 3, 12, 187005) There should be no desire to spring a surprise upon those who attend meetings by asking for subscription.
('38', 80, 3, 13, 187111) The honest course is to let them know beforehand that they will be asked to pay.
('38', 80, 3, 14, 187192) No one need pay unless he believes in the Memorial and its object.
('38', 80, 3, 15, 187259) I know, too, that a man may revere the memory of Deshbandhu and still not believe in the spinning movement.
('38', 80, 3, 16, 187367) But I would venture to remind such people of what were Deshbandhus last wishes expressed to his wife, his sister and his trusted lieutenants and Satis Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan and to me almost exactly 7 days before his death.
('38', 80, 3, 17, 187607) He said that as soon as he descended from Darjeeling, he would throw himself heart and soul into the spinning movement.
('38', 80, 3, 18, 187727) He could see that that was the greatest constructive movement we could undertake and that it was the most effective method of village organization and village reconstruction.
('38', 80, 3, 19, 187902) It was for that reason that he had asked me to send for Satis Babu with
('38', 81, 0, 1, 187974) 82 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 81, 1, 2, 188015) whom he had discussed the plan of working the spinning movement and it was for the spinning movement that he had intended to spend the largest part of the money that had been collected for village reconstruction.
('38', 81, 1, 3, 188228) The Spinners Association, therefore, is the natural outcome, if I may say so, of Deshbandhus wishes.
('38', 81, 2, 4, 188329) TO ORGANIZERS
('38', 81, 3, 5, 188343) If all goes well, I hope during the year to cover, besides Bihar, part of Maharashtra, Madras Presidency including Karnatak, U.P., Bengal and Orissa.
('38', 81, 3, 6, 188493) I should love to visit the other provinces also if time and health permit and if they intend to subscribe to the Memo rial, that is, khadi work.
('38', 81, 3, 7, 188638) To Orissa I have promised to go and pass there, so far as it is humanly possible, the month of November, not because I expect to make large collections but because it is to my mind an epitome of our distressful condition.
('38', 81, 3, 8, 188860) Orissa regenerate is to me the regeneration for the whole of India.
('38', 81, 3, 9, 188928) It is a land which need not be the poorest in the country.
('38', 81, 3, 10, 188987) Its people are in no way inferior to those of the other parts of India.
('38', 81, 3, 11, 189059) They have a fine history all their own.
('38', 81, 3, 12, 189099) They have magnificent temples.
('38', 81, 3, 13, 189130) They have the Lord of the Universe in their midst who knows no distinction between his creatures.
('38', 81, 3, 14, 189228) And yet, sad to relate, under the very shadow of the mighty temple people die of hunger in their thousands.
('38', 81, 3, 15, 189336) It is a land of chronic poverty, chronic famine, and chronic disease.
('38', 81, 3, 16, 189406) Nowhere have I seen in the eyes of people so much blankness, so much despair, so much lifelessness as in Orissa.
('38', 81, 3, 17, 189519) I therefore look forward to my stay in November with sad pleasure.
('38', 81, 3, 18, 189586) It is a province that can be, ought to be, easily organized for spinning, because the people have no work.
('38', 81, 3, 19, 189693) The whole of Orissa cannot be transplanted to the factories of Bengal or the factories of all India put together.
('38', 81, 3, 20, 189807) It would be wrong even if it was possible.
('38', 81, 3, 21, 189850) Happily it is not possible.
('38', 81, 3, 22, 189878) The people must live on their own land and learn to be resourceful, industrious, and learn even to be happy.
('38', 81, 3, 23, 189987) They have forgotten what happiness can be.
('38', 81, 3, 24, 190030) Let the workers in Orissa, therefore, understand their responsibility.
('38', 81, 3, 25, 190101) I expect them to throw themselves heart and soul into the spinning movement.
('38', 81, 3, 26, 190178) Let them not think of the whole of Orissa.
('38', 81, 3, 27, 190221) Let them think of single villages where they will establish themselves, and where they may, by prayerful and persistent effort, lift the people out of the Slough of Despond into which they have stuck.
('38', 82, 0, 1, 190422) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 83
('38', 82, 1, 2, 190464) And though, as I have said, I do not expect to make large collections, I shall welcome the only pies of the people who will attend meetings, even as I welcomed them when I travelled in 1921. The sight of old people with their trembling fingers untying the knots which firmly held their pies and willingly surrendering them to me is never to be forgotten.
('38', 82, 1, 3, 190819) I want to see it again and renew, if a renewal is necessary, the determination that this winter of despair is to be changed into the summer of hope and happiness within a measurable distance of time.
('38', 82, 1, 4, 191019) May I ask the organizers also to bear in mind that the tour is to be almost incessant and that I must do my editing and attend to my correspondence during the hours they may leave for me and in the trains?
('38', 82, 1, 5, 191225) Besides Mondays, at least three hours should be left for me in addition to the time required for ablutions and meals.
('38', 82, 1, 6, 191343) All night demonstrations must be avoided.
('38', 82, 1, 7, 191385) It is impossible after a strenuous days work to stand the strain of disturbance during sleeping hours.
('38', 82, 1, 8, 191488) And as this is to be a purely business tour, the meetings should be so arranged and the audiences should be so seated as to leave passages for collectors to pass to and fro.
('38', 82, 1, 9, 191662) All shoutings and noises should be avoided.
('38', 82, 1, 10, 191706) I have observed that where management is effi cient, collections mount up.
('38', 82, 1, 11, 191781) The audiences have invariably been found by me to be responsive.
('38', 82, 1, 12, 191846) Though the thousands of the rich are welcome, I know that it is the coppers and the single rupees of the poor people that bless the movement.
('38', 82, 1, 13, 191988) It is theirs and let them freely contribute to it their mite.
('38', 82, 2, 14, 192050) Young India, 20 1 1927
('38', 82, 3, 15, 192073) 65. THE CENTRAL FACT
('38', 82, 4, 16, 192094) During my tour in so far as it has progressed up to now, I have observed that spinning organizations have not an accurate register of spinners and that the figures supplied and published by me from time to time in these pages were based upon the deductions drawn from the actual wages paid to the spinners.
('38', 82, 4, 17, 192401) For statistical information the calculation is sound enough because it must err on the right side, i.e., of understatement.
('38', 82, 4, 18, 192525) But it is not good enough for the movement itself.
('38', 82, 4, 19, 192576) The spinning movement depends for its permanence upon a vital and direct contact being established between the workers and the spinners; for then and then only shall we be able to understand the wants,
('38', 83, 0, 1, 192778) 84 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 83, 1, 2, 192819) aspirations and limitations of the spinners.
('38', 83, 1, 3, 192864) The object is to penetrate the remotest Indian homes in the innumerable villages of India and to introduce a ray of hope and light into these homes.
('38', 83, 1, 4, 193013) This we shall never do, if we do not establish a living touch with the spinners.
('38', 83, 1, 5, 193094) We cannot, therefore, be satisfied with the work of middlemen whom we may not and do not know.
('38', 83, 1, 6, 193189) We must be able to trace the course of every pie till it is safely deposited in the hands of the spinners.
('38', 83, 1, 7, 193296) And let it be remembered that spinning is the central fact of the movement, not weaving, not dyeing, not printing, not even carding and ginning, anterior though the last two processes are to spinning.
('38', 83, 1, 8, 193497) For the economic solution depends upon a supplementary employment being found for the largest number of the semi starved millions.
('38', 83, 1, 9, 193628) That employment by far the best is spinning and that alone, as will be seen by a study of the figures for the various provinces given in these pages.
('38', 83, 1, 10, 193778) The Bihar figures reproduced in this issue show 489 weavers against 2,698 spinners.
('38', 83, 1, 11, 193862) My own observation is that ten spinners are required to feed one weaver both working for the same amount of time.
('38', 83, 1, 12, 193976) The ultimate ambition is to teach the spinners carding and ginning so as to enable them to increase their earnings as spinners without much effort and without much training.
('38', 83, 1, 13, 194150) This is being done on a fairly large scale in Bihar, Bengal and the Madras Presidency.
('38', 83, 1, 14, 194237) The Spinners Association can justify its existence therefore only upon its achieving a progressive amelioration in the economic condition of the vast masses who can be reached in no other way in a shorter time.
('38', 83, 1, 15, 194448) The movement depends also for its increasing influence and vitality upon this fact of its tender care for the millions of whom it has as yet only touched but a small part.
('38', 83, 1, 16, 194620) Workers have suggested to me that, if an accurate register is to be kept of every spinner, it would involve extra cost.
('38', 83, 1, 17, 194740) Possibly, it will.
('38', 83, 1, 18, 194759) Not being in charge of a single centre, I am unable fully to under stand the difficulty of keeping such registers.
('38', 83, 1, 19, 194874) But I can say without any fear of challenge that, whatever the cost may be, a complete register of spinners is an absolute necessity until spinning has become an automatically working movement beyond risk of destruction.
('38', 83, 1, 20, 195095) The extra cost that the keeping of such a register may involve will be worth undertaking if we are to put the movement on a stable foundation.
('38', 83, 1, 21, 195238) What an accurate and simultaneous entry of every pie received and spent in a banking corporation is to its honest existence and steady
('38', 84, 0, 1, 195373) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 85
('38', 84, 1, 2, 195415) growth, an accurate register of spinners is to the honest existence and steady growth of the spinning movement.
('38', 84, 1, 3, 195527) I hope therefore that every spinning organization will without any loss of time set about keeping a full and up to date register of its spinners.
('38', 84, 1, 4, 195673) Needless to say that the workers who will be incharge of the registers and who will come in contact with the spinners must be menand how nice if they were women?of unimpeachable character and purity.
('38', 84, 1, 5, 195873) The discovery of this flaw in the movement was made by me through the hypersen sitiveness of the workers of Bengal.
('38', 84, 1, 6, 195989) In my notice of the Abhoy Ashram report, 1 I made an incidental observation that our statements of figures must not contain abouts and nearlies and then I made a general observation about the necessity of purity of character.
('38', 84, 1, 7, 196215) I had in making that observation no one in particular in mind but owing to the juxtaposition of the general remark to the mention of the work of the Abhoy Ashram some of its inmates suspected that my remarks were aimed at them.
('38', 84, 1, 8, 196443) I had no difficulty in disabusing their minds of the suspicion; but the conversation enabled me to under stand and convince the members of the Ashram of the necessity of keeping an accurate up to date register of spinners.
('38', 84, 1, 9, 196666) I am therefore not sorry for the paragraph that I wrote in my notice of the Abhoy Ashram, if only because it has led to the discovery of the flaw in our human account keeping.
('38', 84, 1, 10, 196842) But let me reiterate for the information of all concerned that in this spinning movement which is fraught with tremendous consequences, we cannot put too much stress upon the absolute necessity of members of our organizations being and remaining beyond suspicion, and if we are to attain this standard of purity, we will have to develop a thick skin enough to stand and take in good part well meant suggestions, criticisms and observations.

('38', 84, 3, 13, 197326) I must not withhold the following letter from the readers :
('38', 84, 4, 14, 197386) I have perused your article Swamiji the Martyr with the care and reverence it deserves.
('38', 84, 4, 15, 197474) I have read it five times before attempting to criticize it.
('38', 84, 4, 16, 197535) This is to avoid hasty criticism.
('38', 84, 5, 17, 197569) The article is undoubtedly written in fascinating language.
('38', 84, 5, 18, 197629) I envy your style.
('38', 84, 5, 19, 197648) It attracts, but to me it appears, that it is rather dangerously attractive.
('38', 84, 6, 20, 197725) 1 Vide Abhoy Ashram Khadi Work, 30 12 1926.
('38', 85, 0, 1, 197769) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 85, 1, 2, 197810) My criticism is based on my estimation of your character.
('38', 85, 1, 3, 197868) I have often debated with some friends on this subject.
('38', 85, 1, 4, 197924) They hold that you are a statesman in the garb of a saintready to forgo truth in the cause of your country.
('38', 85, 1, 5, 198032) I have on the contrary maintained that you are a saintwho has entered politics in fulfilment of your mission, to practise truth in the face of most trying and perplexing circumstances.
('38', 85, 1, 6, 198217) I shall be very obliged to know if my estimation is correct.
('38', 85, 1, 7, 198278) For if it is not, the criticism that follows has little value.
('38', 85, 1, 8, 198341) I am of the opinion that a man of policy is within his rights to write in the manner you have done.
('38', 85, 2, 9, 198441) You will agree with me that to suppress truth is a form of falsehood; to refuse to call a spade a spade when you feel it like that is cowardice; and that fearlessness and truth go together.
('38', 85, 3, 10, 198631) Do you feel, Mahatmaji, that the murder of Swamiji was an inhuman, barbarous and cruel act of a Muslim ruffian and that the entire Muslim community should be ashamed of it?
('38', 85, 3, 11, 198804) Why do you refuse to characterize it as such?
('38', 85, 3, 12, 198850) Instead of condemning the deed and the doer, and those who are responsible for this act (those who describe Hindu leaders as Kafirs the hot Muslim propagandists and the mad Muslim priests), you have begun to defend the murderer and hold an apology for the community.
('38', 85, 3, 13, 199117) You never defended Dyer.
('38', 85, 3, 14, 199142) Is not a European a brother too?
('38', 85, 4, 15, 199175) You say further, Islam means peace.
('38', 85, 4, 16, 199211) Is this truth?
('38', 85, 4, 17, 199226) Islam as taught by the Koran and practised by Muslims ever since its birth never meant peace.
('38', 85, 4, 18, 199320) What makes you write a thing so patently wrong?
('38', 85, 4, 19, 199368) Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism of course teach peace, but not Islam.
('38', 85, 4, 20, 199439) May I know what makes you think and write like this?
('38', 85, 5, 21, 199492) You never minced matters when condemning the wrongs of the Government, you never minced matters when you condemned Arya Samaj, why fear to condemn Muslims for even proved wrongs?
('38', 85, 6, 22, 199671) I am sure if such a black act had been committed by a Hindu against a
('38', 85, 7, 23, 199741) Muslim leader (which Heaven forbid!), you would have condemned the murderer
('38', 85, 8, 24, 199817) and the community in unsparing terms.
('38', 85, 8, 25, 199855) You would have asked Hindus to repent
('38', 85, 9, 26, 199893) in sack cloth and ashes, to offer fasts, hold hartal, raise memorial to the
('38', 85, 10, 27, 199969) departed Muslim and many other things.
('38', 85, 10, 28, 200008) Why do you accord preferential
('38', 85, 11, 29, 200039) treatment to your blood brothersthe Muslims?
('38', 85, 12, 30, 200084) A truth teller knows no fear, not even of the sword of Islam and I trust
('38', 85, 13, 31, 200157) you will oblige me by giving reply to above in the columns of your esteemed
('38', 85, 14, 32, 200233) weekly.
('38', 85, 14, 33, 200241) The writer is frank and obviously in earnest and reflects the prevalent mood.
('38', 86, 0, 1, 200319) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 87
('38', 86, 1, 2, 200361) To clothe me with sainthood is too early even if it is possible.
('38', 86, 1, 3, 200426) I myself do not feel a saint in any shape or form.
('38', 86, 1, 4, 200477) But I do feel I am a votary of Truth in spite of all my errors of unconscious omission and commission.
('38', 86, 1, 5, 200580) The correspondent has judged rightly that I am not a statesman in the garb of a saint.
('38', 86, 1, 6, 200667) But since Truth is the highest wisdom, sometimes my acts appear to be consistent with the highest statesmanship.
('38', 86, 1, 7, 200780) But I hope I have no policy in me save the policy of truth and ahimsa.
('38', 86, 1, 8, 200851) I will not sacrifice truth and ahimsa even for the deliverance of my country or religion.
('38', 86, 1, 9, 200941) This is as much as to say that neither can be so delivered.
('38', 86, 1, 10, 201001) In writing about the assassination of Swamiji, I have not suppressed truth.
('38', 86, 1, 11, 201077) I do believe the act to be all that the correspondent describes.
('38', 86, 1, 12, 201142) But I feel pity for the murderer even as I felt for General Dyer.
('38', 86, 1, 13, 201208) Let not the correspondent forget that I refused to be party to any agitation for the prosecution of General Dyer.
('38', 86, 1, 14, 201322) I do claim that a European is just as much brother to me as a Mussalman Indian or a Hindu.
('38', 86, 1, 15, 201413) What I do feel about the assassin is that he is himself a victim of foul irreligious propaganda in the name of religion.
('38', 86, 1, 16, 201534) Hence it is that I have held the newspapers that have corrupted the public mind to be responsible for the murder.
('38', 86, 1, 17, 201648) I do hold the maulvis and all those who have indulged in exciting hatred against Swamiji to be responsible.
('38', 86, 1, 18, 201756) But I do regard Islam to be a religion of peace in the same sense as Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism are.
('38', 86, 1, 19, 201866) No doubt there are differences in degree, but the object of these religions is peace.
('38', 86, 1, 20, 201952) I know the passages that can be quoted from the Koran to the contrary.
('38', 86, 1, 21, 202023) But so is it possible to quote passages from the Vedas to the contrary.
('38', 86, 1, 22, 202095) What is the meaning of imprecations pronounced against the Anaryas 1?
('38', 86, 1, 23, 202165) Of course these passages bear today a different meaning but at one time they did wear a dreadful aspect.
('38', 86, 1, 24, 202270) What is the meaning of the treatment of untouchables by us Hindus?
('38', 86, 1, 25, 202337) Let not the pot call the kettle black.
('38', 86, 1, 26, 202376) The fact is that we are all growing.
('38', 86, 1, 27, 202413) I have given my opinion that the followers of Islam are too free with the sword.
('38', 86, 1, 28, 202494) But that is not due to the teaching of the Koran.
('38', 86, 1, 29, 202544) That is due in my opinion to the environment in which Islam was born.
('38', 86, 1, 30, 202614) Christianity has a bloody record against it, not because Jesus was found wanting, but because the
('38', 86, 2, 31, 202712) 1 Non Aryans
('38', 87, 0, 1, 202725) 88 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 87, 1, 2, 202766) environment in which it spread was not responsive to his lofty teaching.
('38', 87, 1, 3, 202839) These two, Christianity and Islam, are after all religions of but yesterday.
('38', 87, 1, 4, 202916) They are yet in the course of being interpreted.
('38', 87, 1, 5, 202965) I reject the claim of maulvis to give a final interpretation to the message of Mahomed as I reject that of the Christian clergy to give a final interpretation to the message of Jesus.
('38', 87, 1, 6, 203149) Both are being interpreted in the lives of those who are living these messages in silence and in perfect self dedication.
('38', 87, 1, 7, 203271) Bluster is no religion nor is vast learning stored in capacious brains.
('38', 87, 1, 8, 203343) The seat of religion is in the heart.
('38', 87, 1, 9, 203381) We Hindus, Christians, Mussalmans and others have to write the interpre tation of our respective faiths with our own crimson blood and not otherwise.

('38', 87, 3, 12, 203580) January 20, 1927
('38', 87, 4, 13, 203597) Mahatmaji in replying thanked the Boards for presenting him addresses.
('38', 87, 4, 14, 203668) He thanked the boys of the Brahmacharya Ashram also for singing before him the sweet Vedic hymns.
('38', 87, 4, 15, 203766) He said that there was neither any necessity, nor had he so much time at his disposal to reply separately to all the addresses presented to him.
('38', 87, 4, 16, 203911) But one thing had drawn his attention.
('38', 87, 4, 17, 203950) He said that he was told in three or four addresses that attempts were being made to start Ayurvedic dispensaries in many parts of the province.
('38', 87, 4, 18, 204095) It seemed to him that the people of Bihar were interesting themselves in the Ayurvedic system of treatment.
('38', 87, 4, 19, 204203) He had expressed his opinion on the subject on many occasions and he would like to draw their attention to that.
('38', 87, 4, 20, 204316) He believed that there was a good deal of truth in that system, but he believed none the less that the practitioners of that system had their own defects and joined the profession without proper training.
('38', 87, 4, 21, 204521) He admitted that the Western system of medical treatment was very defective, but he knew this also that the Indians did not do even half of what the people of Europe were doing for the success of their medical science.
('38', 87, 4, 22, 204740) But they had great opportunity to work for the improvement of that science.
('38', 87, 4, 23, 204816) He requested the Municipalities and District Boards to see to this matter.
('38', 87, 4, 24, 204891) He further requested the vaidyas to make a scientific study of the system.
('38', 87, 4, 25, 204966) If there were defects in the system,
('38', 87, 5, 26, 205003) 1 At the meeting, addresses were presented to Gandhiji on behalf of the Mun icipality, the District Board, the goshalas, the Youngmens Debating Club and the Arya Samaj.
('38', 88, 0, 1, 205172) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 89
('38', 88, 1, 2, 205214) and defects there certainly were, they should not try to conceal them; on the contrary, every effort should be made to remove them.
('38', 88, 2, 3, 205346) Continuing, he said that he was glad to learn that the organizers of the Madhubani goshala agreed with his views on the utilization of the hides of dead cattle
('38', 88, 3, 4, 205506) for the improvement of the cattle themselves.
('38', 88, 3, 5, 205552) Goshalas, he said, had two aspects, one
('38', 88, 4, 6, 205592) economic and the other religious.
('38', 88, 4, 7, 205626) The question of cow protection was a non 
('38', 88, 5, 8, 205668) controversial matter.
('38', 88, 5, 9, 205690) He did not understand why there should be any quarrel with the Muslims on that point.
('38', 88, 5, 10, 205776) His views on kurbani, he said, remained unchanged.
('38', 88, 6, 11, 205827) Continuing, he said that the existing line of work of the goshala had also
('38', 88, 7, 12, 205902) many defects in it.
('38', 88, 7, 13, 205922) They should be maintained in the right and proper way.
('38', 88, 7, 14, 205977) The organizers of these houses should be thoroughly acquainted with the treatment of animal diseases.
('38', 88, 7, 15, 206079) They should know how to house and feed the cows, how to make milk cheaper for the poor village purchasers; in fact, the conductors of goshalas
('38', 88, 8, 16, 206222) must thoroughly study the science of cattle keeping and then alone could the purpose of goshalas be served.
('38', 88, 9, 17, 206330) Proceeding, he said that he had done all he could for the attainment of Hindu Muslim unity but had failed.
('38', 88, 9, 18, 206437) For that reason he had given up reading newspapers even.
('38', 88, 9, 19, 206494) He had no time to read them either.
('38', 88, 9, 20, 206530) His condition, he said, had become like king Janaka of Mithila who had looked indifferently when his own city was burning, for he had done all he could to prevent the fire.
('38', 88, 9, 21, 206703) Similarly his (Mahatmajis) attitude towards Hindu Muslim differences was that of indifference for he knew that it was not in his power to remedy it.
('38', 88, 9, 22, 206852) He said he did not know how or when Hindu Muslim unity would come.
('38', 88, 9, 23, 206919) The people of this country had gone mad; they were unhesitatingly cutting the throats of each other.
('38', 88, 9, 24, 207020) He could not be a party to it.
('38', 88, 9, 25, 207051) His religion was of non violence, his faith in non violence remained as unshaken as it was before, although attempts were made by his friends to convince him of the utility of violence on special occasions.
('38', 88, 9, 26, 207258) To him all things were not as they seemed and he believed firmly that non violence was the religion through which alone one could triumph ultimately.
('38', 88, 9, 27, 207408) For all those reasons, he said, he had stopped dealing with the subject altogether.
('38', 88, 9, 28, 207492) But he believed that the unity would certainly come one day, if not through the agency of man, through the agency of God.
('38', 88, 10, 29, 207614) Referring to khaddar, he said that he was glad that a purse was presented to him for khaddar work.
('38', 88, 10, 30, 207713) But from Madhubani he expected much more.
('38', 88, 10, 31, 207755) Madhubani, he said, was a big khaddar centre.
('38', 88, 10, 32, 207801) He saw that many poor spinners of the place came four or five miles walking on foot with their yarn to take cotton or money from the workers.
('38', 88, 10, 33, 207943) He knew that there were people who were even poorer than they.
('38', 88, 10, 34, 208006) While he was at Champaran he had heard a lady complain that she could not take her bath in the Ganges and clean her clothes because she had no additional clothes to spare.
('38', 88, 10, 35, 208178) This might have been an exaggeration but such cases were not absent.
('38', 88, 10, 36, 208247) There was no other
('38', 89, 0, 1, 208266) 90 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 89, 1, 2, 208307) way to relieve the poverty of those people except by giving them an occupation and the best possible occupation they could give them was spinning.
('38', 89, 2, 3, 208454) Continuing, he said that he had just heard a hymn from the Isopanishad which
('38', 89, 3, 4, 208531) meant that those who did not work stole other mens property.
('38', 89, 3, 5, 208592) What did it mean, he asked.
('38', 89, 3, 6, 208620) It did not mean that he actually stole other mens property but it meant that he lived on the food earned by other mens labour.
('38', 89, 3, 7, 208747) As a matter of fact, no man had any right to live, unless he worked not only for himself but for all men alike, for an individual is but a drop in the great ocean of humanity.
('38', 89, 3, 8, 208923) Similarly, the Gita taught him that no man should eat unless he had performed yajna and of the many yajnas
('38', 89, 4, 9, 209030) sanctioned by that sacred book, that of working for others was the best.
('38', 89, 4, 10, 209103) Spinning, then, was the only work which could help thousands of people; it was the universal yajna which could be performed by all.
('38', 89, 5, 11, 209235) Addressing the ladies, he said that to him all who were clad in foreign clothes were naked, for nothing but khaddar could cover the nakedness of Indians.
('38', 89, 6, 12, 209389) Mahatmaji appealed to the people to look into the affairs of the local national school and of the goshala and help them with money if they deserved it.
('38', 89, 6, 13, 209541) It was the
('38', 89, 7, 14, 209552) duty of a citizen, he said, to help his fellow beings and institutions in distress.
('38', 89, 8, 15, 209636) He concluded by appealing once more for money for khaddar work and asking people to purchase khadi which was stocked at the meeting.

('38', 89, 10, 18, 209837) January 20, 1927
('38', 89, 11, 19, 209854) He said that he was glad to see them once more.
('38', 89, 11, 20, 209902) It was impossible for him to forget the people of Samastipur who had once brought him there in a special train with Bapu Brajkishore Prasad and others.
('38', 89, 11, 21, 210054) He had, therefore, come to Samastipur with great hope.
('38', 89, 11, 22, 210109) His tour, he said, was intended to preach the message of khaddar.
('38', 89, 11, 23, 210175) It pained him very much to see that most of the people who had come to see him had not put on khaddar.
('38', 89, 11, 24, 210278) He had preached the message of khaddar for five long years from thousands of platforms but still the people were reluctant to use khadi.
('38', 89, 11, 25, 210415) Bihar had the capacity to produce as much khaddar as could be consumed in the province and if only the people patronized that great cottage industry, thousands of their unemployed men and womenginners, carders, spinners, weavers, and even bleachers and washermen could be provided with food and clothing.
('38', 89, 11, 26, 210720) Every farthing that they could spend on khadi would go to the homes of their poor countrymen.
('38', 89, 11, 27, 210814) It was their religious duty, therefore, to put on khadi and khadi alone.
('38', 89, 12, 28, 210887) Continuing, he said that by purchasing mill made cloth they were helping only the rich mill owners of either Lancashire or Ahmedabad.
('38', 89, 12, 29, 211021) He was intimately acquainted

('38', 90, 1, 2, 211092) with the condition of labourers through Anasuyabehn.
('38', 90, 1, 3, 211145) He knew it definitely that the labourers were little benefited by the huge amount of money that people spent over mill made cloth.
('38', 90, 1, 4, 211276) The rich mill owners were not in need of money and they had a wide market even outside India, but the poor countrymen of theirs were dying for a bit of rough bread.
('38', 90, 1, 5, 211441) He knew how poor the people of Bihar were, for he had been in Champaran for a long time.
('38', 90, 1, 6, 211530) Would they not be kind and sympathetic to these poor people, he asked.
('38', 90, 2, 7, 211601) Proceeding, he said that money was necessary for the furtherance of khaddar work.
('38', 90, 2, 8, 211683) In order to save crores of money permanently in the country, crores of money were to be invested in the beginning.
('38', 90, 2, 9, 211798) He had come to their door to beg of them that money.
('38', 90, 2, 10, 211851) He regretted that no khaddar was stocked at the place of the meeting, although he was told on his arrival that there were khaddar shops in the town and that some khaddar would surely be stocked on the spot.
('38', 90, 2, 11, 212058) Nevertheless he requested the people to go at once to the khaddar shop and clothe themselves in khadi.
('38', 90, 3, 12, 212161) Concluding, Mahatmaji spoke a few words on the evils of untouchability and paid an eloquent tribute to Shraddhanand, the martyr, who had embraced death in his attempt to regenerate the untouchables.
('38', 90, 4, 13, 212360) An address of welcome on behalf of the Municipality was then read by Babu Giriwardhar, Chairman, to which Mahatmaji made a short reply.
('38', 90, 4, 14, 212496) He expressed his satisfaction that there was no ill feeling between the Hindu and the Mussalmans of Samastipur.
('38', 90, 4, 15, 212608) It was a great thing.
('38', 90, 4, 16, 212630) He hoped that that state of things would continue to exist.
('38', 90, 5, 17, 212690) Referring to their desire to have a khaddar producing centre at Samastipur, he said that if they sincerely desired such an organization, Rajendra Babu would surely look into the matter.
('38', 90, 5, 18, 212876) He hoped that if requisite amount of money was advanced by the people themselves, Rajendra Babu would be coming to their help with all the energy he possessed.
('38', 90, 6, 19, 213036) Referring to the national school, he regretted that it was not what it ought to have been.
('38', 90, 6, 20, 213127) He saw there certain charkhas and the students were also seen sitting by them, but it was all a mockery, a mere show.
('38', 90, 6, 21, 213245) Neither the teacher nor the students knew anything about spinning.
('38', 90, 6, 22, 213312) He had given proper instructions to the head master and he (the head master) had agreed to work according to that plan.
('38', 90, 6, 23, 213432) He hoped that they would send him a satisfactory report within a month.
('38', 90, 7, 24, 213504) Continuing, he said that the municipalities could do a good deal of work if they so desired.
('38', 90, 7, 25, 213597) They could push on the khaddar work to the great profit of not only the work but of themselves also.
('38', 90, 8, 26, 213698) A purse of Rs. 2,000 was then presented to him on which he remarked that Samastipur should not have contributed such a small amount.

('38', 91, 3, 5, 214005) Of course you had great success in Kathiawar.
('38', 91, 3, 6, 214051) Ramdas told all about it.
('38', 91, 3, 7, 214077) Sohaila 2 certainly will have my blessings, if she and hers will behave themselves and wear khadi.
('38', 91, 3, 8, 214176) Here is the letter you want for Dr. Mehta.
('38', 91, 3, 9, 214219) But must you go to Rangoon for the amount?
('38', 91, 3, 10, 214262) Why can you not collect what you can locally and the rest may be collected without your going to Rangoon, seeing that you will allow Hindus to participate in the contributions?
('38', 91, 3, 11, 214439) Of course if you go to Rangoon you will collect the small amount you mention in a few days.

('38', 91, 8, 17, 214651) MAGANLAL, I got your letter and Radhas, and also other letters, acquainting me with Rukhis progress.
('38', 91, 8, 18, 214752) Now we need not worry on her account.
('38', 91, 8, 19, 214790) We are crushed under the triple burden of the doctors services as also those rendered by others.
('38', 91, 8, 20, 214887) We ought not to think of repaying it.
('38', 91, 8, 21, 214925) Even the thought of a token payment would be sinful.
('38', 91, 8, 22, 214978) We can return their kindness only with a general awakening of our conscience.
('38', 91, 8, 23, 215056) How can we make our young men and women see this?
('38', 91, 8, 24, 215106) Had we been house holders, even a single such illness would have consumed what ever Santok might have kept back.
('38', 91, 8, 25, 215219) But there is no end to the illnesses

('38', 92, 1, 3, 215456) Why, even amongst those whom Santok regards as her own there is no less misery.
('38', 92, 2, 4, 215536) I expect that separate accounts of all these matters are properly maintained; I mean they ought to be.
('38', 92, 2, 5, 215639) I would say they are correctly maintained only if the rent and other items are correctly entered.
('38', 92, 2, 6, 215737) I see you have been carrying rather a heavy burden.
('38', 92, 2, 7, 215789) You alone know how it should or could be lightened.
('38', 92, 2, 8, 215841) How are things going on at Vijapur?
('38', 92, 2, 9, 215877) How much khadi has been lying with us?

('38', 93, 2, 3, 216996) AKOLA, Silence Day [February 7, 1927]
('38', 93, 3, 4, 217034) SISTERS, Today I am observing my day of silence in the midst of the members of our Ashram family.
('38', 93, 3, 5, 217132) Kishorelalbhai, Gomatibehn, Nathji, Tulsi Maher and Taraare not all these to be regarded as belonging to our Ashram?
('38', 93, 3, 6, 217249) And who would regard Nanabhai, his wife and Sushila as outsiders?
('38', 93, 3, 7, 217315) So do not expect me to write anything except about them this week.
('38', 93, 3, 8, 217382) Gomatibehn is still having a little fever, and is confined to bed.
('38', 93, 3, 9, 217449) But she is cheerful; no one could say from her face that she was suffering from a long and serious illness.
('38', 93, 3, 10, 217557) The reason for this cheerful ness is her faith.
('38', 93, 3, 11, 217605) May we all have such faith!
('38', 93, 3, 12, 217633) Kishorelalbhai is getting on as usual.
('38', 93, 3, 13, 217672) It cannot be said that he has acquired more strength.
('38', 93, 3, 14, 217726) He even had fever and shivering last night.
('38', 93, 3, 15, 217770) The fever lasted for a short time and subsided.
('38', 93, 3, 16, 217818) Whenever there is illness among the dear ones, Nathji cannot but be in their midst.
('38', 93, 3, 17, 217902) Nanabhai is perpetually ill.

('38', 95, 6, 27, 220521) Sushilas brother is to be operated upon.

('38', 95, 6, 29, 220670) If the operation is not successful marriage would be postponed on account of the mourning.

('38', 97, 2, 3, 222956) MATHURADAS, I have your letter.
('38', 97, 2, 4, 222988) You are always in my thoughts but I just do not find time to write.
('38', 97, 2, 5, 223056) I did not know that Mahadev too had not been able to write to you.
('38', 97, 2, 6, 223123) I have sent your letter to Pattani Saheb and asked him to reply to you direct.
('38', 97, 2, 7, 223202) The only reply he will send is that you should stay there.
('38', 97, 2, 8, 223261) Devdas has sent you Dr. Ansaris letter.
('38', 97, 2, 9, 223301) Let me know your decision after reading it.
('38', 97, 2, 10, 223345) Perhaps you do not know that Revashankarbhai is going to Ceylon, taking Dhiru 2 along with him.
('38', 97, 2, 11, 223441) Even if you do not write letters, Pyarelal must.
('38', 97, 2, 12, 223490) Even other wise Pyarelal should write to me as a rule.

('38', 97, 6, 19, 223843) February 8, 1927 The reason why I have taken the trouble to carry out this examination 4 is that I have heard much praise of you, and what I am saying now is not to criticize you, but because I appreciate your effort and wish to help you.
('38', 97, 6, 20, 224082) I must inform you that I am not satisfied if this is the standard of the most brilliant boy of the school.
('38', 97, 6, 21, 224189) I am not satisfied either with his pronunciation or with the translation.
('38', 97, 6, 22, 224263) English pronunciations were also bad.
('38', 97, 6, 23, 224301) Only teachers who can teach correct pronunciation, whether of Sanskrit or English, should be employed.
('38', 97, 6, 24, 224404) If such teachers are not available, then we should stop teaching.
('38', 97, 6, 25, 224470) But we have forsaken satyagraha and so plan our work to please the people anyhow.
('38', 97, 6, 26, 224552) Let us follow truth in our system of education too.
('38', 97, 6, 27, 224604) I will now
('38', 98, 0, 1, 224615) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 99
('38', 98, 1, 2, 224657) suggest a little modification in your attitude to the charkha.
('38', 98, 2, 3, 224720) I see that the charkha has a place on your programme, but it is one out of the four or five things you teach here.
('38', 98, 2, 4, 224835) Now I want you to understand that the charkha has a place all its own, for reasons that should be obvious to you.
('38', 98, 2, 5, 224949) For charkha is not one of the professions that you teach.
('38', 98, 2, 6, 225007) A profession is for earning a livelihood, and if charkha was to be taught as a profession it should have no place on your syllabus.
('38', 98, 2, 7, 225139) But it has a special purpose.
('38', 98, 2, 8, 225169) When you put it in line with carpentry, clay modelling, etc., you are guilty of a confusion of thought.
('38', 98, 2, 9, 225273) Charkha is an instrument of service.
('38', 98, 2, 10, 225310) In a national school therefore where the nation expects us to train national servants, the scheme of studies will centre round the charkha.
('38', 98, 2, 11, 225450) It is a science in itself and it is a science which gives us a knowledge of the means of ameliorating the condition of the masses.
('38', 98, 2, 12, 225581) Devotion to a cause is no longer a strong point in our life.
('38', 98, 2, 13, 225642) A true brahmachari is one who is devoted to his ideal and single minded in his pursuit of the Brahman.
('38', 98, 2, 14, 225745) If you at all want to give a place to the charkha, then it ought to have a special place.
('38', 98, 2, 15, 225835) The distinctive quality of our national schools should be that we treat them as a great yajna and should train ourselves to run them accordingly.
('38', 98, 2, 16, 225981) You must always think how much the knowledge of English helps in the propagation of the charkha, what support the Gita gives to the charkha, and what improvement you can effect in it if you learn carpentry and smithy.
('38', 98, 3, 17, 226199) Do you know that we have not a national institution where mechanical engineering is taught and where good spindles are made?
('38', 98, 3, 18, 226324) If therefore you learn mechanics, concentrate on learning how to make a true spindle and how to mend a wrong one.
('38', 98, 3, 19, 226438) You should be able to tell the circumference of an ideal wheel, the distance between the axle and the poles, the number of revolutions of your spindle, etc.
('38', 98, 3, 20, 226595) A carpenter in a national school will not have as his ambition the making of an ideal cabinet, but of an ideal charkha.
('38', 98, 3, 21, 226715) In short, you should study the charkha scientifically and with religious zeal, i.e., with a view to making it the mightiest lever of the nations salvation.

('38', 99, 2, 3, 227038) February 8, 1927 If I could think of anything that is untouchable it is foreign clothes.
('38', 99, 2, 4, 227127) Anything that is prejudicial to the welfare of the nation is untouchable.
('38', 99, 2, 5, 227201) Anything that is calculated to do the nation a disservice is untouchable.
('38', 99, 2, 6, 227275) Liquor therefore is untouchable, foreign cloth is untouchable, but no human being is untouchable, and I regard it as fiendish or satanic to regard a fifth of the land as untouchable.

('38', 99, 4, 9, 227522) February 8, 1927
('38', 99, 5, 10, 227539) Mahatmaji addressed the meeting emphasizing the need for khaddar and the removal of untouchability.
('38', 99, 5, 11, 227639) Some questions were put to him and he answered them.
('38', 99, 5, 12, 227692) The important question was as to how the one crore of rupees collected for the Tilak Swaraj Fund had been spent.
('38', 99, 6, 13, 227805) In replying to this question at length, Mahatmaji invited the curious to study the audit accounts published by the All India Congress Committee.
('38', 99, 6, 14, 227950) Every pie had been properly accounted for.
('38', 99, 6, 15, 227993) Did they distrust the honesty of the treasurers like Seth Revashanker Jagjivan Zaveri and Seth Jamnalal Bajaj?
('38', 99, 6, 16, 228104) The fact was that some people had given their contributions specially earmarked for certain purposes and they were being spent for them.
('38', 99, 6, 17, 228241) For example, Seth Revashankerbhai had himself given Rs. 40,000 for educational purposes in Kathiawar.
('38', 99, 6, 18, 228343) A gentleman in Bombay had given two to three lakhs for the removal of untouchability and they were being properly used.
('38', 99, 6, 19, 228463) Both the treasurers as well as Mr. Shankerlal Banker, the Secretary of the All India Spinners Association, had given magnificent donations and it was not likely that they would be careless in the management of the funds.
('38', 99, 6, 20, 228684) Capable business man as every one of them was, he was, however, ready to admit that there were some losses in some cases, but the total could not in any case exceed Rs. 50,000. They were due to the inevitable risk that every business man has to face.
('38', 99, 6, 21, 228935) In Bihar, for instance, khadi was sold on credit to a number of people who had failed to satisfy the obligations.
('38', 99, 6, 22, 229049) In Andhra, good Konda Venkatappayya was imposed upon by certain people.
('38', 99, 6, 23, 229121) He had disbursed certain amounts, which could not be readily realized.
('38', 99, 6, 24, 229192) He had put undue trust in them and they had deceived him.
('38', 99, 6, 25, 229250) Everyone knew that he had not taken a single pie for himself.
('38', 99, 6, 26, 229312) Then there were cases of loss, which the greatest carefulness on ones part does not always succeed in avoiding.
('38', 99, 6, 27, 229424) Recently Sjt.

('38', 100, 1, 3, 229633) Could he ask him to repay the amount?
('38', 100, 1, 4, 229671) He was bound to enter it in the accounts as being lost, though Mahadev Desai himself was looking forward to make good the loss as soon as possible.
('38', 100, 2, 5, 229819) These things were bound to happen in the regular course of business and he would even warn the audience that on rare occasions there might be even frauds.
('38', 100, 2, 6, 229974) But, knowing all these things, if they thought that good work was being done, they might give whatever they could.
('38', 100, 2, 7, 230089) He for himself was bound to trust the workers, whom the people trusted.
('38', 100, 2, 8, 230161) Dastane, for instance, was their worker.
('38', 100, 2, 9, 230202) If he commanded their trust, why should Gandhiji distrust him?
('38', 100, 2, 10, 230265) Mahatmaji assured them that every pie would be credited and accounted for and every loss accurately shown.
('38', 100, 3, 11, 230372) Knowing all these things, if they wanted to subscribe to the Deshbandhu Memorial Fund, which is the same as the Khaddar Fund, let them subscribe; and he assured them that whatever they gave would be carefully spent and accounted for in the best manner possible.

('38', 100, 5, 14, 230670) The eventful month of April will be soon on us with its memories of the birth of the nation accompanied by unparalleled rejoicings in which lakhs upon lakhs of people took part and which showed the possibilities of what the nation, if it could only act with one mind, could do.
('38', 100, 5, 15, 230948) It is a month which showed also what haughty, revengeful and merciless Imperialism could do to save itself.
('38', 100, 5, 16, 231056) The 6th and the 13th of April 1 are never to be forgotten days in the life of the nation.
('38', 100, 5, 17, 231146) Since then the nation has been struggling not to return evil for evil, not to act in a spirit of retaliation, but to use for self purification the mingled crimson stream that flowed in Jallianwala.
('38', 100, 5, 18, 231344) The nation has been struggling to express itself in a non violent spirit expressed by the spinning wheel and khadi, the removal of untouchability and solidarity of the different sects and creeds.
('38', 100, 5, 19, 231540) It is clear, however, that khadi is the only thing in which the whole nation can take part.
('38', 100, 5, 20, 231632) If we want to act non violently, we must act constructively, patiently and with quiet and quenchless confidence in ourselves and in our method.
('38', 100, 5, 21, 231776) We must evolve unity, strength and iron discipline.
('38', 100, 5, 22, 231828) We must learn to give effect to our views in spite of the vast odds against us.
('38', 100, 5, 23, 231908) Let us realize that the British rule is imposed upon us because British commerce is forced upon us.
('38', 100, 5, 24, 232008) If we could but purify British commerce, we would purify the British connection.
('38', 100, 5, 25, 232089) Our commercial
('38', 101, 0, 1, 232104) 102 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 101, 1, 2, 232146) transactions with the British as with the world should be on our terms and should therefore be mutually beneficial and absolutely voluntary.
('38', 101, 1, 3, 232287) But Lancashire cloth is a symbol of our helpless exploitation, whereas khadi is the symbol of self help, self reliance and freedom, not merely of individuals or groups, sects or clans, but of the whole nation.
('38', 101, 1, 4, 232497) It is a movement in which the prince and the pauper, men and women, boys and girls, Hindus and Mussalmans, Christians, Parsis and Jews, Englishmen, Americans and Japanese, if they wish well to India and get rid of the spirit of exploitation, can also take part.
('38', 101, 1, 5, 232759) Thus it is a unique movement.
('38', 101, 1, 6, 232789) It is good not merely for some, not merely for the vast majority, hut it is good for all.
('38', 101, 1, 7, 232879) We may do many other and many more things during the forthcoming National Week.
('38', 101, 1, 8, 232959) But let us at least organize khadi.
('38', 101, 1, 9, 232995) Here are the ways: 1. We can, every one of us, buy as much khadi as we can.
('38', 101, 1, 10, 233071) 2. We can sell as much khadi as we can.
('38', 101, 1, 11, 233111) 3. We can spin as much yarn as we can.
('38', 101, 1, 12, 233150) 4. We can give as much as we can to the All India Spinners Association and collect from others.
('38', 101, 1, 13, 233246) 5. Lastly, if we have the will and the opportunity, we can dedicate ourselves wholly to khadi work.
('38', 101, 1, 14, 233346) As I write this, the question arises in my own mind: But what about the immediate present, what about the Bengal detenus who are pining away in their prison cells without any knowledge of charges against them, without any trial and without knowing how long they are to be detained? My answer however is quite clear.
('38', 101, 1, 15, 233662) If I could think of any other more expeditious method of setting them free, I would adopt it and suggest it today; but there is not.
('38', 101, 1, 16, 233795) Slow, as this may seem, it is, in my humble opinion, the surest and the quickest method.
('38', 101, 1, 17, 233884) Let those therefore who have belief in khadi or who have no belief in anything else, do their best bit during the National Week.
('38', 101, 1, 18, 234013) A true soldier does not argue as he marches how success is going to be ultimately achieved.
('38', 101, 1, 19, 234105) But he is confident that if he only plays his humble part well, somehow or other the battle will be won.
('38', 101, 1, 20, 234210) It is in that spirit that every one of us should act.
('38', 101, 1, 21, 234264) It is not given to us to know the future, But it is given to every one of us to know how to do our own part well.
('38', 101, 1, 22, 234378) Let us then do that which we know is possible for us if we only will.

('38', 102, 2, 3, 234536) In reply to my innocent paragraph about the evil habit of using English at our public meetings, a habit happily growing less day by day, a correspondent writes: 1
('38', 102, 3, 4, 234699) The Hindu of 28th January quotes in extenso your article 2 in Young India suggesting that in your proposed tour to the Southern Presidency, any address that may be presented to you should be in the vernacular of the place.
('38', 102, 3, 5, 234922) You suggest also that a Hindi translation of the address should be supplied for your benefit.
('38', 102, 3, 6, 235016) I observe further that you think that the time has come when South India should dispense with English for large public meetings.
('38', 102, 3, 7, 235145) According to you, it is the English speaking leaders who are blocking the way to our rapid progress among the masses by their refusal to learn Hindi.
('38', 102, 3, 8, 235295) But the truth seems to be that, had it not been for this language, there would have been no active political life in India as we have it today.
('38', 102, 3, 9, 235439) .Just as you say it would be an insult to inflict English on an audience composed of colliery workmen, I contend that to inflict any other language but English on an audience composed of people collected from various parts of India will be an affront to the latter.
('38', 102, 3, 10, 235705) You will remember that the President 3 of this years Congress was in the first instance called upon to speak in Hindi.
('38', 102, 3, 11, 235824) It was only his rare courage and his rarer wit that saved him from what looked to be a very embarrassing situation.
('38', 102, 3, 12, 235940) Supposing the President addressed that body in his own vernacular, how many in the audience would have understood him?
('38', 102, 3, 13, 236059) Or for the matter of that, how many of the delegates assembled would have sat through the whole speech?
('38', 102, 3, 14, 236163) So long therefore as a common Indian language suitable to India and Burma is not agreed upon, English is bound to be and will be the only medium of communication among the Indian people.
('38', 102, 3, 15, 236350) Instead of therefore setting your face against the use of the English language, and until such time as a common language is evolved for India, a man situated in your position should not add to the existing difficulties of the people by calling upon them to learn altogether a different language.
('38', 102, 3, 16, 236646) You remark in your article that it would be difficult to approach the masses if English is used as the medium.
('38', 102, 3, 17, 236757) I quite agree with you there.
('38', 102, 3, 18, 236787) But the masses should in the first instance be approached by people belonging to themselves and who live in their midst.
('38', 102, 3, 19, 236908) It is, of course, understood that when approaching them their own language will be used.
('38', 102, 4, 20, 236997) I publish the letter because it reflects an attitude with which one

('38', 103, 1, 2, 237203) has to reckon.
('38', 103, 1, 3, 237218) The correspondent in his eagerness to defend his own laziness, for it is difficult otherwise to characterize his mentality, has missed the following fundamental facts: English is known hardly to one per cent of the population.
('38', 103, 1, 4, 237445) It will never be learnt by the masses and we have to reckon daily more and more with the masses in all our political transactions The Congress every year has delegates and visitors the majority of whom do not know and understand English, and when it becomes a thoroughly democratic body, whose delegates are scavengers, cobblers, farmers, washermen, tailors and such others, there will be very few to know English.
('38', 103, 1, 5, 237860) As against hardly one per cent of the total population knowing English, over 60 per cent of the total population of India at the present moment understand the ordinary rustic Hindustani.
('38', 103, 1, 6, 238047) For an Indian it is any day infinitely easier to learn Hindustani than English.
('38', 103, 1, 7, 238127) These are the facts, but the correspondent has overlooked them.
('38', 103, 1, 8, 238191) Moreover, in his zeal to make English the official language of the Congress, the correspondent has forgotten the agitation that has been going on in the Congress ever since its inception for a wider recognition of Hindustani as the common medium and that there is now already a resolution of the Congress making Hindustani the common medium.
('38', 103, 1, 9, 238533) The correspondent seems to think that I decry the use of even learning English, which I have never done.
('38', 103, 1, 10, 238638) That the English speaking Indians have rendered immense service to the country nobody can deny, but unfortunately it is equally undeniable that further progress is being blocked by us English speaking Indians refusing to learn the language of the masses and to work amongst them in accordance with methods best suited to them.
('38', 103, 1, 11, 238965) The instance given by the correspondent of Mr. Chen is beside the point.
('38', 103, 1, 12, 239038) I do not know what he is doing, but I do know that he is not speaking to the Chinese masses through English.
('38', 103, 1, 13, 239147) And all I have claimed is that at our mixed mass meetings where the language of the province will not be understood by all, if any other language is to be adopted, it must be Hindustani.
('38', 103, 1, 14, 239334) Surely, it is a proposition which does not admit of any challenge.

('38', 104, 2, 3, 239497) I tender heartiest welcome to Sir Habibullah Deputation on its return home.
('38', 104, 2, 4, 239573) The public have not yet sufficient knowledge for form ing a definite opinion about the results of the Deputation.
('38', 104, 2, 5, 239687) 1 One thing is however certain that they have by their tact, ability and cohesion contributed not a little to the peaceful atmosphere that reigned supreme whilst the Round Table Conference was going on.
('38', 104, 2, 6, 239890) One can only hope that the atmosphere will be reflected in the result of their deliberations.
('38', 104, 2, 7, 239984) Not much importance need be attached to the cable gram from South Africa attributing the opinion on the part of a section of the Indian settlers, rejecting the conclusions of the Round Table Conference.
('38', 104, 2, 8, 240187) It is as yet too early.
('38', 104, 2, 9, 240211) The opinion can only be based upon conjecture, for nobody knows what the conclusions are.
('38', 104, 2, 10, 240301) We are therefore bound to suspend judgment till we have the full text before us of the agreement said to have been arrived at between the parties.
('38', 104, 2, 11, 240448) The ever vigilant Mr. Andrews is there to watch Indian interests.
('38', 104, 2, 12, 240514) In this connection an Indian settler sends me the following appropriate reflections on the deliberations: 2
('38', 104, 3, 13, 240622) Recent messages from South Africa through Reuters agency and Mr. C. F. Andrews suggest that with the enhanced status acquired by the Union of South Africa.
('38', 104, 3, 14, 240778) she has begun to view the Indian question.
('38', 104, 3, 15, 240821) in a more generous spirit.
('38', 104, 4, 16, 240848) The Round Table Conference too according to the Hon.
('38', 104, 4, 17, 240901) Mr. Sastri 3 has terminated successfully and Mr. Sastri has expressed his thorough satisfaction with the agreement arrived at between the Union and the Indian Government delegates.
('38', 104, 4, 18, 241082) We can only wish that his high hopes may be fulfilled.
('38', 104, 4, 19, 241137) Mr. Sastri has further advised the Indian settlers: If you, our people from India, play the game, it will not be long before you get your due.
('38', 104, 4, 20, 241280) even in the measure that you expect. Mr. Sastri has thus given the Indian settlers the hope that they would even be granted full civic rights.
('38', 104, 4, 21, 241423) Whether Indians are given full civic rights or not, even if the present policy of persecuting and driving Indians from pillar to post is abandoned and they are allowed to earn

('38', 105, 1, 3, 241850) It were well to give the advice to play the game to the Union 1
('38', 105, 2, 4, 241914) Government.
('38', 105, 2, 5, 241926) Even while we are given the hope of a satisfactory settlement of the Indian question and while we are being told that a change of heart has taken place, we find that the policy of depriving Indians of their means of livelihood and ousting them is being persistently pursued by the Provincial Governments with the sanction of the Union Government.
('38', 105, 2, 6, 242273) The Town Council of Pietermaritzburg is clearing what it has chosen to term the European locality of every single Indian trader by refusing to grant him a renewal of his licence.
('38', 105, 2, 7, 242452) Many old established firms have thus already had to close down their businesses in those places without any compensation whatsoever.
('38', 105, 2, 8, 242585) From a report published in Indian Opinion dated December 31, we find that several tailors, shoemakers and barbers who were carrying on their respective occupations for the last ten, fifteen and twenty years have been refused licences on the only ground that they were Indians, and on appeal the decision of the Licensing Officer was upheld by the Town Council in every case, That this should happen just when the Conference was deliberating is not a little surprising and it is a glaring illustration of who has not been playing the game.

('38', 106, 1, 4, 244109) You may even demonstrate the right method of doing things for a couple of days, but you must not get mixed up with it every day.

('38', 106, 5, 12, 244610) JAMNALAL, Tulsi Maherji tells me that I should let you know my opinion about [supplying] cotton to him, and that you propose to act accor dingly.
('38', 106, 5, 13, 244756) I am on my way to the station and will therefore write only this.
('38', 106, 5, 14, 244822) I think we should make up the deficit by drawing on the Charkha Sangh or from the Ashram.
('38', 106, 5, 15, 244912) If you have no objection to drawing on the Charkha Sangh and obtaining the Councils sanction later, you may do so.
('38', 106, 5, 16, 245027) Or else debit it to the Ashram account and let him have the cotton.
('38', 106, 5, 17, 245095) He has Rs. 300. He wants to have a wagonload of cotton packed in gunny bags.
('38', 106, 5, 18, 245172) You may let him have that much if it would not cost more than Rs. 800, over and above the Rs. 300. I would think it advisable to send less cotton if there could be a saving on railway freight.
('38', 106, 5, 19, 245365) He has asked for 50 Bengali maunds presuming that transport charges up to Raxaul will be the same for 50 maunds as for 25. If it is so it appears advisable to send 50 maunds.
('38', 106, 5, 20, 245540) Now if I have left anything unsaid you should do as you think fit.

('38', 107, 5, 8, 246051) February 10, 1927
('38', 107, 6, 9, 246069) One of the special features of the tour was the auctioning of the caskets containing addresses at the meetings where they were given.
('38', 107, 6, 10, 246203) The beginning was made at Jalgaon and the process was continued until Dhulia.
('38', 107, 6, 11, 246281) Gandhiji said: You must know, friends, that excepting things which have a special artistic value and which I can hand over to Prof.
('38', 107, 6, 12, 246413) Malkani 2 who is collecting such things at the Gujarat Vidyapith, I cannot afford to carry these caskets with me.
('38', 107, 6, 13, 246527) For one thing I carry no steel trunks with me, nor have I any provision at the Ashram to keep them.
('38', 107, 6, 14, 246627) The only course left for me therefore is to sell them.
('38', 107, 6, 15, 246682) Dont you think that in doing so I am in any way disregarding or belittling the love with which they are being given.
('38', 107, 6, 16, 246799) On the contrary, I propose to return the love in the best manner I can, and that is by converting the caskets into money for the work which is nearest my heart and for which you are showering your love on me.
('38', 107, 7, 17, 247008) The sentiment was appreciated everywhere, with the result that at a village like
('38', 107, 8, 18, 247089) Shahade a trifling casket fetched as much as Rs. 300, and at Dondaiche the plate and
('38', 107, 9, 19, 247174) other things fetched over Rs. 200. Young India, 24 2 1927

('38', 108, 3, 4, 247395) BHIAISHRI FULCHAND, I have your letter.
('38', 108, 3, 5, 247435) The Parishads stars, it appears, are not favourable.
('38', 108, 3, 6, 247488) We might therefore have to make some [propitiatory] sacrifice.
('38', 108, 3, 7, 247551) We have not yet been able to get a site for setting up the pandal; surely we cannot afford to be so dependent.
('38', 108, 3, 8, 247662) Why can we not hold the convention in some private premises?
('38', 108, 3, 9, 247723) Why not at Umar sheths or some other farm?
('38', 108, 3, 10, 247766) Why not at Ranavav?
('38', 108, 3, 11, 247786) But a player always sees more than an onlooker.
('38', 108, 3, 12, 247834) It is no use my arriving at any decision when I am so far away.
('38', 108, 3, 13, 247898) Please do whatever you think proper.
('38', 108, 3, 14, 247935) Devchandbhai asks for some dates during April or May.
('38', 108, 3, 15, 247989) But it cannot be done.
('38', 108, 3, 16, 248012) The position at the moment is that a date once cancelled is finally cancelled.
('38', 108, 3, 17, 248091) From April to July all days are engaged.
('38', 108, 3, 18, 248132) A few days in August are free.
('38', 108, 3, 19, 248163) After that I shall be free only in early December.
('38', 108, 3, 20, 248214) I shall certainly be at the Ashram in the beginning of March.
('38', 108, 3, 21, 248276) We shall meet then.

('38', 109, 5, 7, 249112) February 12, 1927
('38', 109, 6, 8, 249130) At Amalner for instance a doubt was expressed as to the utility of carrying the message of khaddar to a mill area like that place.
('38', 109, 6, 9, 249261) There are 2,000 labourers here and they form the bulk of the population.
('38', 109, 6, 10, 249334) Do you expect them to wear khadi?
('38', 109, 6, 11, 249368) Do you expect the mill owners to wear khadi?
('38', 109, 7, 12, 249413) Gandhiji gave a lengthy reply.
('38', 109, 7, 13, 249444) It is a question that you may well ask, and yet should not need to ask at this time of the day.
('38', 109, 7, 14, 249540) Truth has to be repeated a million times if it is not understood by all.
('38', 109, 7, 15, 249613) If only a single expression of truth was sufficient everyone should have been a believer in God by now.
('38', 109, 7, 16, 249717) The fact is that the truth that God is one has a million times been told, but the hearts of only a few have been able to receive it.
('38', 109, 7, 17, 249850) The 330 rupees that the labourers have contributed to the purse are for me worth their weight in gold.
('38', 109, 7, 18, 249953) But it is not for the first time that labourers are giving concrete expression to their sympathy.
('38', 109, 7, 19, 250051) Even the mill owners have done so and will do so in the conviction that they are helping a good cause, and the labourers are doing so because of their sympathy for a fellow labourer like myself.
('38', 109, 7, 20, 250246) But an understanding of ones duty and the observance thereof are different things.
('38', 109, 7, 21, 250329) If they went together we should have Ramarajya.
('38', 109, 7, 22, 250377) There are for instance those who know the value of brahmacharya but who cannot observe it.
('38', 109, 7, 23, 250468) Even so there are those who appreciate the message of khadi but who are not able to conquer their love of ease and comfort and exclusively wear khadi.
('38', 109, 7, 24, 250619) Many come and tell me: We value your message, but show us the way to carry it out. And as honest conviction is bound to be followed by practice sooner or later this attitude fills me with more hope.
('38', 109, 7, 25, 250818) You may be employing 2,000 labourers here but do not forget that you tear them from the soil, do

('38', 110, 0, 1, 250951) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 111
('38', 110, 1, 2, 250994) not forget that your mills can provide only a handful with labour, and can never find employment for the millions who must be rooted to the soil and who want more work.
('38', 110, 1, 3, 251163) The question has been before the Royal Commission of Agriculture, the question is before the Viceroy and I challenge any one to find a better solution than the one I have placed before the country.
('38', 110, 1, 4, 251361) Dr. Roy 1 could not carry his chemical works to the famine areas in Bogra and Khulna; he had to fall back on the spinn ing wheels.
('38', 110, 1, 5, 251492) Let not your ambition be to concentrate thousands of spindles in a mill, but to convert every home into a spinning mill.
('38', 110, 1, 6, 251613) Do I seek to destroy the mill industry? I have often been asked.
('38', 110, 1, 7, 251678) If I did I should not have pressed for the abolition of the excise duty.
('38', 110, 1, 8, 251751) I want the mill industry to prosperonly I do not want it to prosper at the expense of the country.
('38', 110, 1, 9, 251850) On the contrary if the interests of the country demand that the industry should go, I should let it go without the slightest compunction.
('38', 110, 1, 10, 251988) The mill owners who support me understand my attitude and many want this movement to prosper, even if its prosperity should mean their loss.
('38', 110, 1, 11, 252129) And you ask how those who produce mill cloth may wear anything else.
('38', 110, 1, 12, 252198) Do you know that in Manchester the manufacturers do not wear their own products?
('38', 110, 1, 13, 252279) You need not mind your inability to use cloth produced by your own mills.
('38', 110, 1, 14, 252353) The good Duchess of Sutherland saw the miserable plight of the poor islanders of Hebrides and placed spinning wheels and looms at their disposal.
('38', 110, 1, 15, 252499) The citizens of Man chester, including mill owners, do wear the hand spun stuffs prepared by the Hebrides people, even at three times the cost of the mill stuff.
('38', 110, 1, 16, 252661) Do not hanker after cheapness and fineness.
('38', 110, 1, 17, 252705) If you want cheap and fine stuffs you must spin fine yarn as the late Jogesh Chatterji did or you must spend more money for it.
('38', 110, 1, 18, 252833) Those who talk of swaraj can not have both cheapness and fineness.
('38', 110, 1, 19, 252900) Think of the sacrifices all fighters have to make.
('38', 110, 1, 20, 252951) In Queen Elizabeths time heavy duties were imposed on foreign stuffs and heavy penalties were prescribed for the purchase of Holland laces.
('38', 110, 1, 21, 253091) Am I asking for much when I ask you to remember your poor and to purchase their khadi?
('38', 110, 1, 22, 253178) Do not say you will maintain the poor on charity.
('38', 110, 1, 23, 253228) Only two classes of people are entitled to charity and no one elsethe Brahmin who possesses not hing and whose business it is to spread holy learning, and the cripple

('38', 112, 4, 7, 254888) DHULIA, February 13, 1927
('38', 112, 5, 8, 254914) MY DEAR KSHITISH BABU, I have your two letters redirected to me at Dhulia.
('38', 112, 5, 9, 254989) I am glad that Anil is better and entirely out of danger.
('38', 112, 5, 10, 255047) I send you a copy of my itinerary.
('38', 112, 5, 11, 255082) Please continue to advise me upon his progress.
('38', 112, 5, 12, 255130) I have just learnt that Tarini Babu has left Wardha.
('38', 112, 5, 13, 255183) I am myself more anxious about him than Anil because Tarini Babus disease has made a home in his body whereas Anils was a temporary crisis.
('38', 112, 5, 14, 255323) Tarini Babu therefore requires the best attention possible.
('38', 112, 5, 15, 255383) I suggest your taking him to Dr. Bidhan Roy or Sir Nilaratan, if necessary, with a note from Sir P. C. Roy.
('38', 112, 5, 16, 255491) We must not hesitate to take the best advice available if we are to save him.
('38', 112, 5, 17, 255569) The samples sent by you have not been forwarded to me.
('38', 112, 5, 18, 255624) I shall he writing to the people at Jalgaon about it.
('38', 112, 5, 19, 255678) I value the note you have sent me about Mr. Chatterjee.
('38', 112, 5, 20, 255734) I am going to make use of it for Young India.
('38', 112, 5, 21, 255780) 1 Please give my respectful condolences to the family of the deceased.
('38', 112, 5, 22, 255851) I hope you and other members are keeping well and that the work at Sodepur is progressing.
('38', 112, 5, 23, 255942) I know that the whole brunt now falls upon your shoulders, but thank God they are broad enough to bear it.

('38', 113, 5, 11, 256623) DEAR FRIEND, I have your illuminating letter.
('38', 113, 5, 12, 256669) Everything coming from you commands my attention because I like your straightforward and popular exposition of a subject which has been [made] unnecessarily abstruse by economists.
('38', 113, 5, 13, 256850) I am taking the liberty in anticipation of your permission of sending your letter to Prof.
('38', 113, 5, 14, 256941) Wadia so that he may understand and appreciate your viewpoint.
('38', 113, 5, 15, 257004) I would love to constitute myself a bridge over the gulf that, without cause as it seems to me, separates economists and that makes it difficult for a layman to study this very important subject.
('38', 113, 5, 16, 257200) If all the principal economists of our country will agree on the fundamentals and issue a brief, reasoned joint statement, it will prove very useful to students like me who have opportunities of educating the popular mind.
('38', 113, 5, 17, 257423) What is this thunderbolt that Mr. Shroff has hurled in our midst?
('38', 113, 5, 18, 257489) It is occasionally that I get a peep at the newspapers.
('38', 113, 5, 19, 257545) Whenever there fore you get a moment and have anything to pass on to a busy man like me, please do not hesitate.
('38', 113, 5, 20, 257658) For, though I am saying nothing in the Press, I am watching everything with an absolutely open mind.

('38', 114, 3, 5, 257960) These speak for themselves.
('38', 114, 3, 6, 257988) I therefore add nothing beyond saying that I know that I can implicitly rely upon your doing everything possible to put this controversy 2 on a high and moral level.
('38', 114, 3, 7, 258154) I send you my itinerary up to the end of the month so that in the event of your wanting to say to me anything urgently you can put yourself in direct touch with me without the intervention of my permanent address.

('38', 115, 5, 9, 259403) [February 13, 1927] 1
('38', 115, 6, 10, 259425) BHAISHRI NANABHAI, I got your letter at Jalgaon.
('38', 115, 6, 11, 259474) Please go through the telegram from Manilal, which I got at Amalner, a copy of my letter to him and my letter 2 to Sushila and then pass them on to Chi.
('38', 115, 6, 12, 259627) Sushila.
('38', 115, 6, 13, 259636) Now that Chi.
('38', 115, 6, 14, 259650) Shanti is not to be operated upon for the time being, it would suit me if the marriage is solemnized at an early date and then the eight days of Holi 3 will not come in the way.
('38', 115, 6, 15, 259828) I am likely to reach Sabarmati on the 6th which will be Phagan Sud 3. I would suggest we discontinue consulting an astrologer for choosing a date.
('38', 115, 6, 16, 259975) For an auspicious thing the sooner the better.
('38', 115, 6, 17, 260022) But in these matters I would not insist on my own views.
('38', 115, 6, 18, 260079) I can appreciate your wish to have Akola as the venue.
('38', 115, 6, 19, 260134) All my tour dates are fixed.
('38', 115, 6, 20, 260163) Only this change could be made: Since the Kathiawar [Political] Conference has been postponed I am free from the 4th to the 8th; on the 4th I reach Bombay.
('38', 115, 6, 21, 260319) From Bombay I can straight away come up to Akola alongwith Manilal.
('38', 115, 6, 22, 260387) Thus we can have the marriage on the 6th when I reach there and having spent there Monday the 7th, my silence day, I can leave for Ahmedabad.
('38', 115, 6, 23, 260529) I must reach Ahmedabad by the 10th at the latest.
('38', 115, 6, 24, 260579) I would like to put you to the minimum inconvenience.
('38', 115, 6, 25, 260633) If you would have the date some time before the 6th that could be done if the marriage is performed wherever I happen to be.
('38', 115, 6, 26, 260758) The other alternative is that you should

('38', 116, 1, 3, 260981) You would all like me to be there.
('38', 116, 1, 4, 261016) I know Ba would desire it, so would Manilal.
('38', 116, 1, 5, 261061) But I do not consider my presence indispensable.
('38', 116, 1, 6, 261110) If you agree to this and if you can find out a date that suits you and falls before March 11 you can have a day of your choice.
('38', 116, 1, 7, 261238) I do not regard marriage as always indispensable.
('38', 116, 1, 8, 261288) When it becomes indispensable it could only be a religious rite which may be performed with or without the presence of elders.
('38', 116, 1, 9, 261415) And it could be done any time.
('38', 116, 1, 10, 261446) This is why I do not insist on my being there.
('38', 116, 1, 11, 261493) I impor tune you for an early date because Manilals work in Natal suffers, and I want to send him off at the earliest opportunity.
('38', 116, 1, 12, 261624) Please consider all this and fix any day that suits you, and, if possible, send me a wire.

('38', 116, 5, 17, 261976) February 13, 1927
('38', 116, 6, 18, 261994) The programme at Dhulia was heavy, but everything was so ordered and quiet that Gandhiji could address six meetings during the day, spinning on his charkha throughout the speeches!
('38', 116, 6, 19, 262175) He said: You will not regard me as impertinent if I go on spinning whilst I address you.
('38', 116, 6, 20, 262264) I do so because of the wonderful stillness here, and because I think I can best respond to your affection by giving you an object lesson in the thing I most believe in.
('38', 116, 6, 21, 262433) When Dr. Tagore came to our Ashram some years ago, 2 I asked him, after the morning prayers
('38', 116, 7, 22, 262525) 1 From Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter; the first speech is from the issue of February 24 and the other two from that of March 3. 2 In 1920.
('38', 117, 0, 1, 262663) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 117, 1, 2, 262705) were over, to address a few words to our boys.
('38', 117, 1, 3, 262752) He said nothing, spoke nothing by way of apology, but sang one of his sweetest songs in his sweetest way and was quiet.
('38', 117, 1, 4, 262872) That to my mind was the acme of his courtesy.
('38', 117, 1, 5, 262918) He satisfied us with the best that his soul could give.
('38', 117, 1, 6, 262974) I am simply following him in turning my wheel before you, which is my only lyre and through which I think I can render the greatest service to India.
('38', 117, 2, 7, 263124) There have been everywhere addresses from the local bodies.
('38', 117, 2, 8, 263184) Let me summarize
('38', 117, 3, 9, 263201) Gandhijis reply to the Local Board address at Dhulia.
('38', 117, 3, 10, 263255) During my wanderings throughout the land I have not yet come across a single local body which has been fanctioning of its own independent initiative and which I could point to as an ideal body.
('38', 117, 3, 11, 263449) Mr. Lionel Curtis remarking on the contrast between an Indian village and an English village said that whereas the one gives you an impression of general untidiness and reminds you of a village built on a dunghill, the other gives an impression of cleanliness and health and beauty all around.
('38', 117, 3, 12, 263743) Of course he knew nothing of the condition of the Indian villager, he did not know that his daily income was five per cent of that of the English villager.
('38', 117, 3, 13, 263899) But let us not ignore one substratum truth in his remark.
('38', 117, 3, 14, 263957) There is no gainsaying the fact that our villager betrays a woeful ignorance of even the rudiments of village sanitation.
('38', 117, 3, 15, 264079) One could deplore the race prejudice amongst the South African Europeans, but their attempts to keep their towns healthy and sanitary were heroic and worthy of imitation.
('38', 117, 3, 16, 264250) Do not say that politics occupy all your time and that you have no time for other things.
('38', 117, 3, 17, 264340) It is a lame excuse.
('38', 117, 3, 18, 264361) The capacity to look after the village and town sanitation is included in our capacity for swaraj and when we demonstrate it, nothing on earth can stand between us and swaraj.
('38', 117, 3, 19, 264537) You may be sure that we shall be able to retain only as much as our capacity has won for us.
('38', 117, 3, 20, 264630) Some of our local bodies keep only those roads clean as are likely to be used by Government officials, but they have no regard for the roads which are used day and night by poor villagers and their bullocks, and which are always and everywhere ill kept.
('38', 117, 3, 21, 264884) Cant we make the roads more easy and better negotiable and make the villagers and the bullocks lot a little less irksome?
('38', 117, 4, 22, 265006) At Dhulia the merchants had insisted on voting him an exclusive address and an exclusive purse, and in the address Gandhiji as one of them, as belonging to the Vaisya class.
('38', 117, 4, 23, 265180) And in his reply they got more than they had bargained for.
('38', 118, 0, 1, 265240) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 119
('38', 118, 1, 2, 265283) As I said at Jalpaiguri in 1925 1, it is not the Brahmins, nor the Kshatriyas nor the Sudras that lost India; it is the Vaisyas who lost India, and it is the Vaisyas alone who can regain it.
('38', 118, 1, 3, 265474) Indian history is replete with instances of Banias who helped and served the English shopkeeper to the prejudice of India.
('38', 118, 1, 4, 265597) The shopkeepers who came here in search of trade became warriors to protect their trade and became Brahmins too to maintain their dominion based on trade.
('38', 118, 1, 5, 265752) Our varna sharma dharma does not say that a Bania may not be a Kshatriya and fight for the honour of his mother and sister, nor does it say that a Bania may not acquire knowledge like the Brahmin and serve like the Sudra.
('38', 118, 1, 6, 265974) The Englishman combined all the qualities in himself; and dazzled at his feat we forgot our dharma, we became cowards, we forgot the real work of the Baniaagriculture, cow pro tection and tradeand became traitors to the motherland.
('38', 118, 1, 7, 266206) You can retrieve the situation today by becoming true Banias again, by capturing again the whole of the national trade.
('38', 118, 1, 8, 266326) Our black caps, our mill dhotis and our womens fine saris are the badges of our shame and slavery.
('38', 118, 1, 9, 266425) Instead of keeping the raw produce in the country and manufacturing it we looked to our narrow interests of the hour, sold the raw produce, and helped the Englishman to tighten his grip on us.
('38', 118, 1, 10, 266618) We are engaged in our immoral trade today to the eternal ruin of our motherland.
('38', 118, 1, 11, 266699) Doctors may heal if we are ill, lawyers may help us in law courts, but only merchants can win swaraj.
('38', 118, 1, 12, 266801) I want us to be the Vaisya of the Bhagavad Gita, the Vaisya whose natural calling is protection of the cow, agriculture and trade, for his own country.
('38', 118, 1, 13, 266953) If we were true to our calling why should a scrap of foreign cloth come to our country, why should a cow be sold to a butcher, why should nine crore rupees worth of hides be sent out abroad?
('38', 118, 1, 14, 267144) What is it that has so deadened our sense to our obvious duty?
('38', 118, 1, 15, 267207) We think we must trade in foreign cloth, we refuse to listen if someone asks us to keep our dead cattle and treat their hides ourselves.
('38', 118, 1, 16, 267344) We turn away in disgust when we are asked to convert our dairies into good milk producing centres and tanneries.
('38', 118, 1, 17, 267457) I cannot tell you the deep agony of my soul.
('38', 118, 1, 18, 267502) Do you think I am mistaken?
('38', 118, 1, 19, 267530) Do you think I am in my dotage?

('38', 119, 4, 12, 268229) You need not feel the least embarrassment.
('38', 119, 4, 13, 268272) You should not even hesitate to call each other by your names.
('38', 119, 4, 14, 268335) In later life this kind of reserve comes in our way.
('38', 119, 4, 15, 268388) I see no sense in it.
('38', 119, 4, 16, 268410) Manilal too has become tongue tied.
('38', 119, 4, 17, 268446) I shall write to him to shake off his bashfulness.
('38', 119, 4, 18, 268497) Write to me about Gomatibehns health.
('38', 119, 4, 19, 268535) I do hope Kishorelal wont have fever again.

('38', 119, 8, 23, 268690) Unrevised DHULIA, February 14, 1927
('38', 119, 9, 24, 268726) MIRA, I wrote yesterday a brief letter.
('38', 119, 9, 25, 268766) You need not worry about sending me your account 2. You should certainly keep an account of every pice spent, and that not on scraps of paper, but in a properly kept account book.
('38', 119, 9, 26, 268946) It is incredibly simple.
('38', 119, 9, 27, 268971) There are credit entries and debit entries.
('38', 119, 9, 28, 269015) Cash is debtor to the extent of moneys received by it, creditor to the extent paid out.
('38', 119, 10, 29, 269103) 1 Vide Letter to Sushilabehn Mashruwala, 13 2 1927.
('38', 119, 11, 30, 269155) 2 Account keeping was always a nightmare for me, and I finally reduced it to writing down everything and giving it to others to add up and balance. (Mirabehn)

('38', 120, 2, 6, 269657) A ledger is an index for the different accounts in a cash book and a day book.
('38', 120, 2, 7, 269736) A day book contains all transactions where no cash passes.
('38', 120, 2, 8, 269795) Thus sales on credit and purchases on credit will be entered in a day book.
('38', 120, 2, 9, 269871) This is in practice the whole of account keeping.
('38', 120, 2, 10, 269921) I am surprised you had no wheel there.
('38', 120, 2, 11, 269960) I must give you a travelling charkha such as I have.
('38', 120, 2, 12, 270013) I am asking Khadi Pratishthan to send one to you.
('38', 120, 2, 13, 270063) If you cannot manage it yourself, I must teach you when I come there.
('38', 120, 2, 14, 270133) Dhulia is a very restful place.
('38', 120, 2, 15, 270165) We are accommodated in the house of a worker who joined me when I was working in Champaran.
('38', 120, 2, 16, 270257) And here too lives a gentleman who wears a face gentler even than Andrews, if it is possible.
('38', 120, 2, 17, 270351) Akola was another such place.
('38', 120, 2, 18, 270381) And Akola has given me a bride for Manilal.
('38', 120, 2, 19, 270425) She is Kishorelals niece, 19 years old.
('38', 120, 2, 20, 270465) Marriage will take place almost immediately.
('38', 120, 2, 21, 270510) She will accompany Manilal when he leaves for South Africa.
('38', 120, 2, 22, 270570) She belongs to a godly family.

('38', 121, 5, 10, 271180) 1 could not bear to see you crying when I was at Sodepur.
('38', 121, 5, 11, 271238) It is good if God would let our dear ones be with us, nor is it bad if He takes them away.
('38', 121, 5, 12, 271329) They belong to Him; and what is it to us if He takes away his own?
('38', 121, 5, 13, 271396) Surely, He is going to take away everyone.
('38', 121, 5, 14, 271439) Being the greatest of all actors we call Him Natavar, the Supreme Actor.
('38', 121, 5, 15, 271512) He tosses us as He pleases.
('38', 121, 5, 16, 271540) We are after all puppets.
('38', 121, 5, 17, 271566) Is it not better to dance in tune with Him than with the world?

('38', 122, 3, 7, 272410) I do not know if Nanabhai will have Panditji or someone else to perform the rites; I have left it to him.

('38', 122, 8, 18, 272935) SISTERS, I am in receipt of your letter written by Chi.
('38', 122, 8, 19, 272991) Manibehn.
('38', 122, 8, 20, 273001) What you write to me in regard to women who intend to visit the Ashram is quite right.
('38', 122, 8, 21, 273088) For the present, I cannot expect any of you to keep them with you.
('38', 122, 8, 22, 273155) I wish only that you will mix freely with them, will look after them if they are ill, will not keep away from them, and you will invite them off and on to your midst.
('38', 122, 8, 23, 273322) You might have known that Taras elder sister Chi.
('38', 122, 8, 24, 273372) Sushila has been betrothed to Chi.
('38', 122, 8, 25, 273407) Manilal.
('38', 122, 8, 26, 273416) The marriage will take place at Akola on the 6th of March.
('38', 122, 8, 27, 273475) I shall, therefore, reach the Ashram on the evening of the 8th or on the morning of the 9th.
('38', 122, 8, 28, 273568) 14th is Monday.

('38', 123, 1, 3, 273759) So I shall have only a few days in the Ashram.
('38', 123, 1, 4, 273806) Whether I will or no, I get involved thus in marriages.
('38', 123, 1, 5, 273862) And yet the more I am drawn into such activities, the more I see that it is very necessary for men and women to observe brahmacharya.
('38', 123, 1, 6, 273996) Manilal remained unmarried for 32 years, merely in order to develop self control.
('38', 123, 1, 7, 274078) He then expressed a desire to marry, and so I began looking for a good match.
('38', 123, 1, 8, 274156) As he is to marry in a family of persons devoted to God, I expect nothing but good to result from this alliance.
('38', 123, 1, 9, 274269) We should not feel bashful to talk about marriage.
('38', 123, 1, 10, 274320) But whether married or unmarried, we should not become a prey to passion by such talk.
('38', 123, 1, 11, 274407) One who cannot control ones passions should certainly marry.
('38', 123, 1, 12, 274468) But one who can control them, should do so and seek to obtain moksha in this very life.

('38', 123, 6, 18, 274733) I am glad that the 6th suits you.
('38', 123, 6, 19, 274767) Please get either Gopalrao from Wardha or Sahasrabuddhe there for the marriage ceremony; or shall we ask Panditji to come over from the Ashram?
('38', 123, 6, 20, 274911) Or if there is some particular person in your view, that makes no difference for me.
('38', 123, 6, 21, 274996) Nothing suits me better than if Nath himself performs the rites.
('38', 123, 6, 22, 275061) If you would have Panditji, let me know by wire.
('38', 123, 6, 23, 275110) We shall have no ceremony other than the strictly religious.
('38', 123, 6, 24, 275171) You must not incur expenditure by putting up pandals and other things.
('38', 123, 6, 25, 275242) Please have no sweets in the meals.
('38', 123, 6, 26, 275278) Our new relationship is not going to make you my in laws nor is Sushila going to be my daughter in law; she will still be a daughter to me, and you will all be my cousins as always.
('38', 123, 6, 27, 275460) You must not give away with the bride so much as a grain of gold.
('38', 123, 6, 28, 275526) Indeed, she must not wear any jewellery on the occasion.
('38', 123, 6, 29, 275583) If afterwards she has a liking for them I shall be helpless.
('38', 123, 6, 30, 275644) Because she has as much freedom as you and I.

('38', 124, 1, 3, 275889) Of course I am going to present her a takli, the Gita and a copy of the Bhajanavali, if available.
('38', 124, 1, 4, 275988) In South Africa Manilal wears foreign dress; he had asked my permission for it, but Sushila would not need it.
('38', 124, 1, 5, 276099) In her khaddar sari she will be as resplendent as the celebrated Sita.
('38', 124, 1, 6, 276170) Please do not gather a crowd, nevertheless do not hesitate to invite those whom you ought to.
('38', 124, 1, 7, 276264) I shall leave Bombay along with Manilal by the Nagpur Mail and reach Akola on the 6th morning.
('38', 124, 1, 8, 276359) The 7th being a Monday, I shall stay on there.
('38', 124, 1, 9, 276406) On the 7th if there is a convenient train in the evening I shall straight away leave for Ahmedabad.
('38', 124, 1, 10, 276506) Ramdas and Devdas may arrive there either with me or direct.

('38', 125, 1, 3, 277374) I have written to Nanabhai asking him not to put up any show.
('38', 125, 1, 4, 277436) He should give the bride not even the most insignificant jewels.
('38', 125, 1, 5, 277501) I am giving her nothing.
('38', 125, 1, 6, 277526) In South Africa, you use foreign dress with my permission but Sushila need do nothing of the sort; in her khaddar sari she will look as resplendent as Sita.
('38', 125, 1, 7, 277683) Let me know if you want any change in these arrangements.
('38', 125, 1, 8, 277741) After you are married you are both free to live as you like.
('38', 125, 1, 9, 277802) But I certainly wish that you should give no jewels to Sushila and that there too she should wear no cloth other than khadi.
('38', 125, 1, 10, 277927) The more I think the more I feel that you are going to have a jewel.
('38', 125, 1, 11, 277996) My only fear is whether you would be able to take care of her.
('38', 125, 1, 12, 278059) Please keep your passion under control; let her study.
('38', 125, 1, 13, 278114) The girl would be helpful in many of your activities.
('38', 125, 1, 14, 278168) She can even learn composing.
('38', 125, 1, 15, 278198) If she tries she can improve her Gujarati but it all depends upon you whether you would make a doll or a companion out of her.
('38', 125, 1, 16, 278325) After all, she is just a child.
('38', 125, 1, 17, 278357) She does not know the ways of the world.
('38', 125, 1, 18, 278398) If, henceforth, you will observe more restraint than hitherto I see a blissful future for both of you.
('38', 125, 1, 19, 278501) May God grant strength and wisdom to both of you.
('38', 125, 1, 20, 278551) Now you can easily go to South Africa in March.
('38', 125, 1, 21, 278599) You can make the necessary preparations.
('38', 125, 1, 22, 278640) You should start from there on the 4th and meet me in Bombay on the morning of the 5th.
('38', 125, 1, 23, 278728) I am writing to Ramdas and Devdas that they may come along if they want to.

('38', 126, 10, 15, 279604) Yes I did receive the Schreiner volumes.
('38', 126, 11, 16, 279645) You must not give up the struggle against lifes temptations.
('38', 126, 11, 17, 279706) I do indeed expect you one fine day in India.

('38', 126, 11, 19, 279793) Manilal is to be married on 5th March.
('38', 126, 11, 20, 279832) 3 He will take his wife with him.
('38', 126, 11, 21, 279866) You will look after both please.
('38', 126, 11, 22, 279899) I dare not give you a long love letter as I have to work against time.
('38', 126, 11, 23, 279970) Incessant travelling is my lot this year.

('38', 127, 4, 7, 280649) MANI, I have got your letter.
('38', 127, 4, 8, 280679) It looks as if I shall reach there on the 8th at the earliest.
('38', 127, 4, 9, 280742) There is no news from Karachi.
('38', 127, 4, 10, 280773) How is it that Gangadevi falls ill every now and then?
('38', 127, 4, 11, 280828) We shall arrange for her to go somewhere else for a change of climate if she wants to.
('38', 127, 4, 12, 280915) Ask her as well as Totaram.
('38', 127, 4, 13, 280943) Does she have a restricted diet?
('38', 127, 4, 14, 280976) I will subject you to a test in Sanskrit, carding, spinning, etc., when I come.
('38', 127, 4, 15, 281056) Improve still more your Gujarati handwriting and make further progress in Gujarati grammar.
('38', 127, 4, 16, 281148) The programme for perfecting the Ashram kitchen which has been engaging their attention much must now be brought to an end.
('38', 127, 4, 17, 281272) Do your bit.

('38', 128, 2, 3, 281449) Wednesday [February 16, 1927] 1
('38', 128, 3, 4, 281481) NARANDAS, I got all your letters.
('38', 128, 3, 5, 281515) I have asked Mahadev to reply to them as well as to take the necessary action.
('38', 128, 3, 6, 281594) Something has already been done.
('38', 128, 3, 7, 281627) I still have to write about the laxity in spinning.
('38', 128, 3, 8, 281679) I shall take out some time and attend to it.
('38', 128, 3, 9, 281724) I am writing this on a moving train.
('38', 128, 3, 10, 281761) The schedule was such that I could do nothing.
('38', 128, 3, 11, 281808) But now I have asked the programmes to be so arranged that I may get some more margin.
('38', 128, 3, 12, 281895) Who else but the Charkha Bhandar is to make up the losses resulting from the transfer to Jerajani when the two stores are amalgamated?
('38', 128, 3, 13, 282030) I do not very well understand it as I have forgotten many of the facts.
('38', 128, 3, 14, 282102) Anyway we shall finally decide about it in the Conference which is to be held at Belgaum on the 25th or 26th.
('38', 128, 3, 15, 282212) Are you supposed to attend it?
('38', 128, 3, 16, 282243) Take over into the Charkha Sangh the yarn we got from South Africa.
('38', 128, 3, 17, 282311) I am very glad that you examine the strength of all the yarn.
('38', 128, 3, 18, 282373) Whatever time is spent in it is only .
('38', 128, 3, 19, 282412) 2 for us because we get to learn much out of it.
('38', 128, 3, 20, 282461) Whatever experiences you have, whatever there is worth know ing, do write out in Gujarati and send over to me so that it can be published in Navajivan and we can also take out of it whatever we want for Young India.
('38', 128, 3, 21, 282677) Other things you will learn there and so I do not write about them.

('38', 129, 2, 3, 283125) NASIK, February 16, 1927
('38', 129, 3, 4, 283150) MIRA, I had first thought of asking the Khadi Pratishthan people to debit the Ashram with the price of the travelling charkha that will he sent to you.
('38', 129, 3, 5, 283302) But I reconsidered my decision and I saw that it would be cheaper to have the charkha by value payable parcel.
('38', 129, 3, 6, 283413) If therefore you receive a parcel from Calcutta by value payable post, please discharge the bill there.
('38', 129, 3, 7, 283517) On the 6th and 7th of March, I shall be at Akola for Manilals marriage.
('38', 129, 3, 8, 283589) From the 8th to 14th March I am at the Ashram, 15th to 17th Bardoli.
('38', 129, 3, 9, 283658) I entrain at Surat on the evening of the 17th for the Gurukul.
('38', 129, 3, 10, 283721) With love,

('38', 129, 8, 15, 283931) JAMNALAL, I have your letter.
('38', 129, 8, 16, 283961) I shall reach Bombay some time on the 4th or by the morning of the 5th.
('38', 129, 8, 17, 284033) Dastane wants me to be in Poona on the 4th.
('38', 129, 8, 18, 284077) Jaisukhlal Mehta wants me to devote a few hours to Santa Cruz.
('38', 129, 8, 19, 284140) If I can satisfy him by spending the 5th morning at Santa Cruz I can allot the evening of the 4th to Poona and leave there on the same night for Bombay from where I can proceed to Akola.

('38', 130, 1, 3, 284540) If Nath is there please ascertain from him if he would perform the wedding rites.
('38', 130, 1, 4, 284622) I would like to have the ceremony performed by him, if it is no inconvenience to him.
('38', 130, 1, 5, 284708) I think it would not matter if you could not come because of Janakibehns operation or something else.
('38', 130, 1, 6, 284810) I have to proceed to Sangamner this very evening.

('38', 130, 4, 9, 284924) 111. SPEECH AT NASIK 1
('38', 130, 5, 10, 284947) February 16, 1927 Some youths handed over to me several questions as soon as I arrived here; my replies to them will be my speech today.
('38', 130, 6, 11, 285084) [1.] Dont you think as a Hindu you should concentrate on collecting for the Shraddhanand Fund rather than for any other fund?
('38', 130, 6, 12, 285210) I am an imperfect mortal and my capacities are limited.
('38', 130, 6, 13, 285266) I know the theory and practice of economy, and whilst all my time and energy are given to the country, I am not vain enough to think that I should do all things myself.
('38', 130, 6, 14, 285435) The work you refer to is engaging the attention and energies of men like Malaviyaji and Lalaji and there is no reason why I should also put in my oar.
('38', 130, 6, 15, 285586) At the first meeting held in Calcutta 2 to collect funds for raising a fitting memorial to Shradd hanandji, I was asked to be present by Pandit Malaviyaji and I did so.
('38', 130, 6, 16, 285755) I do not think he expects more from me.
('38', 130, 6, 17, 285795) I claim to follow in daily life the teachings of the Gita and I know that, humble as is the work that I am doing, it is better for me than much other work which may be quite as good and even better but which is not my work.
('38', 130, 7, 18, 286019) [2.] The collections you make today are only for khadi, are they not so?
('38', 130, 7, 19, 286092) If they are, how will you utilize them?
('38', 130, 7, 20, 286132) Yes, of course, this fund is only for khadi because it is being collected for the All India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund.
('38', 130, 8, 21, 286250) 1 From Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.
('38', 130, 8, 22, 286287) The introductory paragraph, questions 2, 5 and 6, and their answers are from Navajivan, 27 2 1927.
('38', 130, 9, 23, 286386) 2 Vide Speech at Public Meeting, Calcutta, 31 12 1926.
('38', 131, 0, 1, 286441) 132 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 131, 1, 2, 286483) Deshbandhus name has been associated with this fund because hehad drawn up, a few days before his death, a scheme for the organization of villages through khadi.
('38', 131, 1, 3, 286645) Khadi work was dear to him.
('38', 131, 1, 4, 286673) The All India Spinners Association has been set up only to collect funds for khadi and use them to organize work.
('38', 131, 1, 5, 286787) Accounts of its funds are being maintained to a pie and everyone has a right to inspect them.
('38', 131, 1, 6, 286881) The Association has an executive committee, auditors and inspectors.
('38', 131, 1, 7, 286950) This Association has now placed before the country a scheme for an organization of khadi service.
('38', 131, 1, 8, 287048) You will ask what effective work this association can do, paying as it will be only thirty rupees a month to each worker.
('38', 131, 1, 9, 287170) Of course, ours is a poor Association, for it has been established with money collected from the poorest of the poor.
('38', 131, 1, 10, 287288) It is not another Indian Civil Service, so that it can afford to pay salaries of thousands of rupees.
('38', 131, 1, 11, 287390) The Indian Civil Service is maintained with taxes paid by the people and is meant to rule the people; our poor little association is meant to serve them.
('38', 131, 2, 12, 287544) [3.] Are you partial to the Mussalmans?
('38', 131, 2, 13, 287584) Why dont you answer the charges some of the Mussalman leaders level against you?
('38', 131, 2, 14, 287665) I can do justice to people of other faiths by appearing to be partial to them, and I know that I am protecting my own faith by showing if you will a reasoned partiality for other faiths.
('38', 131, 2, 15, 287852) I do not, I cannot, wish to harm the Hindu religion, for I am after all a drop in the ocean of Hinduism.
('38', 131, 2, 16, 287957) If Mussalmans call me kaffir, what then?
('38', 131, 2, 17, 287998) What can be the answer to it?
('38', 131, 2, 18, 288028) In South Africa, a nephew of mine was staying with me.
('38', 131, 2, 19, 288083) It was only when people said that I was partial to him that he realized, and I realized, that I was only just to him.
('38', 131, 2, 20, 288201) The fact that the Mussalmans are finding fault with me possibly suggests that I am not yet sufficiently partial to them to convince them that I am just to them.
('38', 131, 2, 21, 288362) Why should I answer their charges?
('38', 131, 2, 22, 288397) All my twenty four hours are consecrated to the service of Lord Krishna who is ever with me, who guides my footsteps, and whom I always pray to do whatever is needed for me.
('38', 131, 2, 23, 288571) He will answer for me, if there be any need.
('38', 131, 3, 24, 288616) [4.] If you fought for the Khilafat, why do you not fight for the Hindu sangathan 1 today?
('38', 131, 3, 25, 288707) The question is well asked.
('38', 131, 3, 26, 288735) I had pledged myself to lay down my life for the Khilafat and I knew that I was indirectly helping thereby the cause of the cow.
('38', 131, 3, 27, 288864) How much cow protection have you

('38', 132, 0, 1, 288918) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 133
('38', 132, 1, 2, 288961) achieved?you will ask.
('38', 132, 1, 3, 288984) Very little, I admit.
('38', 132, 1, 4, 289006) But what does that matter to me?
('38', 132, 1, 5, 289039) To work you have the right and duty and not to fruit thereof, says the Gita.
('38', 132, 1, 6, 289116) 1 It was at the bidding of the Lord that I offered my co operation to the Ali Brothers and rendered whatever help I could.
('38', 132, 1, 7, 289239) I have never had reason to regret it.
('38', 132, 1, 8, 289277) I would do the same thing should another occasion arise.
('38', 132, 1, 9, 289334) That is the teaching of all our religious books.
('38', 132, 1, 10, 289383) Let the people rail at me, insult me if they like.
('38', 132, 1, 11, 289434) I am not going to pay them back in their coin.
('38', 132, 1, 12, 289481) Mine is the religion of tapascharya, the way of penance taught by the scriptures and by Tulsidas.
('38', 132, 1, 13, 289579) That is the law of my being and I cannot do otherwise.
('38', 132, 1, 14, 289634) The whole creation, says the Gita, follows the law of its being.
('38', 132, 1, 15, 289699) How will restraint then avail? 2 My joy is in the fulfilment of my duty and the confidence that when some day the Mussalmans join hands with the Hindus in protecting the cow, everyone will say that the good result is due to the efforts of that mad Gandhi who died working for the cause.
('38', 132, 1, 16, 289986) In my opinion, there is no sanction in Hinduism, Islam or Christianity for the shuddhi, tabligh or proselytizing (respectively) as it is going on today.
('38', 132, 1, 17, 290139) How then can I take part in the shuddhi?
('38', 132, 1, 18, 290180) The Gita and the Tulsi Ramayana teach me to resort to self purification whenever I or my religion is in danger.
('38', 132, 1, 19, 290292) And what is true for me is true for all.
('38', 132, 1, 20, 290333) That process of self purification I am going through all the twenty four hours of my day.
('38', 132, 1, 21, 290423) Parvati, Narada had foretold, would have an ominous looking husband.
('38', 132, 1, 22, 290492) She knew that only Siva was as blissful as he was ominous looking and she performed penance for winning Siva and won him.
('38', 132, 1, 23, 290614) So the lesson of penance and self purifi cation is writ large everywhere in our scriptures and the Himalayas are the living witness to itthe Himalayas where countless rishis ground their bodies to dust for self purification The Vedas, to me, are not the texts writ on paper, but my very conscience and the In dweller.
('38', 132, 1, 24, 290932) They tell me to observe yama and niyama (the cardinal and the causal virtues) and trust everything to Lord Krishna.
('38', 132, 1, 25, 291048) In all humility I claim that all my work is conducive to the service of Hinduism.
('38', 132, 1, 26, 291130) As a Hindu, I could do nothing else.
('38', 132, 1, 27, 291167) The way of doing it is of course my own.
('38', 132, 2, 28, 291208) [5.] Do you know that most of the donors of the money that will be presented to you today are dealers in foreign cloth, and they give you money for the love they bear you, not for the love of khadi?
('38', 132, 3, 29, 291407) 47 2 III.
('38', 133, 0, 1, 291417) 134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 133, 1, 2, 291459) I do not want a single pice offered through love for me; I want people to appreciate my mission and help it with money.
('38', 133, 1, 3, 291579) Through love you can give me another thing.
('38', 133, 1, 4, 291623) Through it you can give me your foreign clothes, but not money.
('38', 133, 1, 5, 291687) The truth is that business men give me money in the belief that, if my business thrives, it will harm neither them nor the country.
('38', 133, 1, 6, 291819) They know that ultimately they will have to deal in khadi.
('38', 133, 1, 7, 291878) They understand the position correctly but today they lack strength of will.
('38', 133, 1, 8, 291955) They ask me to pray to God that He may grant them that strength.
('38', 133, 1, 9, 292020) Meanwhile, they donate money and help this movement.
('38', 133, 1, 10, 292073) They do not give me money in order to deceive me.
('38', 133, 2, 11, 292123) [6.] Why do you confine yourself to khadi work alone and neglect other important or even more important political activities?
('38', 133, 2, 12, 292249) I have already said that the sphere of my work is limited.
('38', 133, 2, 13, 292308) Duryodhana described how his warriors had taken up their due positions on the battle field.
('38', 133, 2, 14, 292400) He had asked everyone to remain in his place and protect Bhishma.
('38', 133, 2, 15, 292466) The varnashrama dharma taught in the Gita also says the same thing.
('38', 133, 2, 16, 292534) It asks everyone to know his own sphere of work.
('38', 133, 2, 17, 292583) If India wants me to serve it, it must understand my limita tions.
('38', 133, 2, 18, 292650) Although it is possible that 1 can do other jobs well, there are people doing them.
('38', 133, 2, 19, 292734) As I believe that no one else can do khadi work as well as I can and since I regard khadi work as my supreme duty, I have confined myself to that work.
('38', 133, 2, 20, 292886) I favour satyagraha, I want to start it, but I want to create a suitable atmosphere for it through khadi.
('38', 133, 2, 21, 292992) Satyagraha is like my very breath, but I regard it as impossible without khadi.
('38', 133, 3, 22, 293072) [7.] What is the extent of the help you are getting from the Mussalmans during this tour?
('38', 133, 3, 23, 293162) I admit that for my khadi work I have been having not much help from them.
('38', 133, 3, 24, 293237) But what does that matter?
('38', 133, 3, 25, 293264) I do not bargain with my brother or wife in my domestic affairs.
('38', 133, 3, 26, 293329) I do my duty and leave the rest to do theirs.
('38', 133, 3, 27, 293375) In the same way I will not bargain with the Mussalmans, as I will not with Pandit Motilalji or Kelkar.
('38', 133, 3, 28, 293478) Why should we fear the Mussalmans?
('38', 133, 3, 29, 293513) We need fear only God and no man.
('38', 133, 3, 30, 293547) Even if men should play you false, do not be deterred from doing your duty, in the confidence that God will take care of you.

('38', 134, 2, 3, 293777) [Before February 17, 1927] 1
('38', 134, 3, 4, 293806) DEAR SATIS BABU, You must be well.
('38', 134, 3, 5, 293841) Now that you have gone out of Calcutta, you must give yourself prolonged rest and be thoroughly restored.
('38', 134, 3, 6, 293947) You will not be anxious about Pratishthan affairs.
('38', 134, 3, 7, 293998) Leave them in Gods hands in so far as your share of the work is concerned.
('38', 134, 3, 8, 294073) After all khadi is not and cannot be one mans affair.
('38', 134, 3, 9, 294127) If it is pleasing in the eye of God, He will raise His own instruments and keep in order those He has raised.
('38', 134, 3, 10, 294237) Let us realize that we are nothing even as a machine is nothing.
('38', 134, 3, 11, 294302) The machinist is everything.
('38', 134, 3, 12, 294331) Let us reduce the teaching, of the Gita and the Ramayana to practice and we shall cease to worry.
('38', 134, 3, 13, 294429) Do please keep me well posted with news about yourselves.
('38', 134, 3, 14, 294487) Here are the dates:

('38', 134, 7, 18, 294714) 113. OUT OF NOTHING
('38', 134, 8, 19, 294734) When one thinks of the immense possibility of the charkha it is surprising that its simple message is taking so long to become universal.
('38', 134, 8, 20, 294872) Nothing comes out of nothing, says a Latin proverb.
('38', 134, 8, 21, 294924) But the charkha would seem to falsify at least the letter of the proverb.
('38', 134, 8, 22, 294998) For without destroying or replacing anything useful, it seeks to utilize the waste and idle hours of the nation.
('38', 134, 8, 23, 295111) This idleness, whether it be regarded as enforced or voluntary, is

('38', 135, 0, 1, 295204) 136 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 135, 1, 2, 295246) killing the very soul of the nation.
('38', 135, 1, 3, 295283) The more I penetrate the villages, the greater is the shock delivered as I perceive the blank stare in the eyes of the villagers I meet.
('38', 135, 1, 4, 295420) Having nothing else to do but to work as labourers side by side with their bullocks, they have become almost like them.
('38', 135, 1, 5, 295540) It is a tragedy of the first magnitude that millions have ceased to use their hands as hands.
('38', 135, 1, 6, 295634) Nature is revenging herself upon us with terrible effect for this criminal waste of the gift she has bestowed upon us human beings.
('38', 135, 1, 7, 295766) We refuse to make full use of the gift.
('38', 135, 1, 8, 295806) And it is the exquisite mechanism of the hands that among a few other things separates us from the beast.
('38', 135, 1, 9, 295912) Millions of us use them merely as feet.
('38', 135, 1, 10, 295952) The result is that she starves both the body and the mind.
('38', 135, 1, 11, 296011) The spinning wheel alone can stop this reckless waste.
('38', 135, 1, 12, 296066) It can do that now and without any extraordinary outlay of money or intelli gence.
('38', 135, 1, 13, 296149) Owing to this waste, we are living in a state almost of suspended animation.
('38', 135, 1, 14, 296226) It can be revived if only every home is again turned into a spinning mill and every village into a weaving mill.
('38', 135, 1, 15, 296339) With it will at once revive the ancient rustic art and the rustic song.
('38', 135, 1, 16, 296411) A semi starved nation can have neither religion nor art nor organization.
('38', 135, 1, 17, 296485) The only objection that has been urged by its critics is that the wheel does not pay.
('38', 135, 1, 18, 296571) But even if it pays only one pice per day, it does pay when we remember that our average income is six pice per day against the fourteen rupees and six rupees per day respectively of the average American and the average Englishman.
('38', 135, 1, 19, 296803) The spinning wheel is an attempt to produce something out of nothing.
('38', 135, 1, 20, 296873) If we save sixty crores of rupees to the nation through the spinning wheel, as we certainly can, we add that vast amount to the national income.
('38', 135, 1, 21, 297018) In the process we automatically organize our villages.
('38', 135, 1, 22, 297073) And as almost the whole of the amount must be distributed amongst the poorest of the land, it becomes a scheme of just and nearly equal distribution of so much wealth.
('38', 135, 1, 23, 297241) Add to this the immense moral value of such distribution, and the case for the charkha becomes irresistible.

('38', 135, 3, 26, 297394) When at the end of the Bihar tour and on my way to the Central Provinces, I heard at Calcutta of the death of Babu Jogeshwar Chatter jee whom I had the privilege of knowing as a spinner who gave

('38', 136, 1, 2, 297632) promise of being able to revive the old Dacca shubnumthe night dew muslinI at once sent a message 1 to Kshitish Babu of Khadi Pratishthan to supply me with details of the deceaseds life.
('38', 136, 1, 3, 297819) These have been now received and I share them with the reader: 2
('38', 136, 2, 4, 297884) Jogeshwar Chatterjee, son of Sjt.
('38', 136, 2, 5, 297918) Jatileshwar Chatterjee of village Panpur in the district of 24 Parganas .
('38', 136, 2, 6, 297992) died on Sunday, the 30th January morning.
('38', 136, 2, 7, 298034) He left behind him his wife, a daughter aged one year, a younger brother and aged father.
('38', 136, 3, 8, 298124) Jogeshwar Babu read up to B.A., and was a teacher for some time.
('38', 136, 3, 9, 298189) He then took service in the E.B.R., and served it for seven years.
('38', 136, 3, 10, 298256) He was aged 35 at the time of death.
('38', 136, 4, 11, 298293) He took to spinning during the Non co operation days, and was an ardent spinner.
('38', 136, 4, 12, 298374) At the Gauhati Exhibition a muslin of 200 counts was exhibited by the Pratishthan, the yarn of which was spun by Jogeshwar Babu.
('38', 136, 4, 13, 298503) During one yearCawnpore Exhibition to Gauhati Exhibitionhe spun 200 count yarn for the above muslin, and sufficient yarn of 100 count, out of which two dhotis are made.
('38', 136, 4, 14, 298672) Of the last two dhotis, one was for Acharya P. C. Ray and the other for his father.
('38', 136, 5, 15, 298756) He was all along spinning on the Pratishthans box charkha.
('38', 136, 5, 16, 298815) He was out and out a khadi man, who used to spin during leisure hours, and made such a rapid progress in spinning.
('38', 136, 5, 17, 298930) I tender my condolences to the family of the deceased and hope that the attempt to reproduce the ancient art will not die with Jogesh Babus death.
('38', 136, 5, 18, 299077) Let it be remembered that Jogesh Babus was a labour of patriotic love.
('38', 136, 5, 19, 299148) And it is only voluntary spinners who can follow up Jogesh Babus grand effort.

('38', 138, 2, 5, 300484) I have thoroughly examined the boys in a lively heart to heart talk and found them sharp in intellect and prompt in answers.
('38', 138, 2, 6, 300609) In short, I see in Ahmed nagar Rashtriya Pathshala a lovely little oasis in the midst of such a vast desert of darkness.
('38', 138, 3, 7, 300730) [Continuing,] Mr. Gandhi said that, if Ahmednagar district was poor, the rest of India was poorer still.
('38', 138, 3, 8, 300835) Hundreds of thousands of men and women were without any kind of employment and almost starving.
('38', 138, 3, 9, 300931) He had not the slightest doubt in his mind that khadi work alone could give these people some employment and bread.
('38', 138, 3, 10, 301047) He appealed to all present to give their mite to him for his great work.

('38', 138, 6, 15, 301293) You will stand this very severe test and come out victorious.
('38', 138, 6, 16, 301355) Read the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita again and again and face the battle like true warriors that you are.
('38', 138, 6, 17, 301469) It is now your double duty to take care of yourselves.
('38', 138, 6, 18, 301524) Among the properties you hold in trust for Gods purposes, your bodies are not the least important.

('38', 140, 7, 11, 303895) Gods, it is said, take away those they love most.
('38', 140, 7, 12, 303945) The human mind has devised many methods of assuaging grief.
('38', 140, 7, 13, 304005) But the real fact is not to feel the grief.
('38', 140, 7, 14, 304049) But that is almost superhuman especially in Hindu society.
('38', 140, 7, 15, 304108) Please tell Hemaprabha Devi not to think of what Anil would have done, if he had lived.
('38', 140, 7, 16, 304196) His work in that body was finished.
('38', 140, 7, 17, 304232) A rare soul such as Anils had much higher work to do and he left the body.
('38', 140, 7, 18, 304307) Let us not grieve over our loss which may be the worlds gain.
('38', 140, 7, 19, 304369) It is as well that we do not know the mysteries of life and death.
('38', 140, 7, 20, 304436) I want you both now to get rid of your weakness.
('38', 140, 7, 21, 304485) Pray do not think of stirring till you have fully recuperated yourself.

('38', 141, 3, 6, 305112) It is difficult on such occasions to give any consolation.

('38', 141, 8, 17, 305632) This insidious attempt that, I think, was made to destroy the Khilafat had to be resisted.
('38', 141, 8, 18, 305723) My resis tance being non violent prevented in my opinion, violence which would but for the movement have undoubtedly broken out.
('38', 141, 8, 19, 305852) The Khilafat movement was not decided upon to bolster any Turkish tyranny.
('38', 141, 8, 20, 305927) Wherever tyranny exists, it must be resisted by non violent means.
('38', 141, 9, 21, 305994) Yours sincerely, REV.

('38', 142, 2, 3, 306207) February 20, 1927 You forget you are a son of Bapus niece; Manilal therefore is your maternal uncle.
('38', 142, 2, 4, 306308) Would children offer any presents to their mother?
('38', 142, 2, 5, 306359) Herein you forget even our Hindu tradition.
('38', 142, 2, 6, 306403) However, if you are so affluent, I am willing to accept the amount for cow protection and the tanning school.
('38', 142, 2, 7, 306513) I might grab all the money that you may offer.
('38', 142, 2, 8, 306560) So, if you are not going to be disappointed, you had better take my advice and keep quiet over it.

('38', 142, 5, 11, 306694) 126. SPEECH AT SHOLAPUR 2
('38', 142, 6, 12, 306720) February 20, 1927
('38', 142, 7, 13, 306738) As at Nasik, 3 the speech at Sholapur was a reply to questions and criticisms made in an open letter addressed to Gandhiji by some people from the town.
('38', 142, 7, 14, 306891) Their first criticism was that those who appeared in khadi on the occasion of Gandhijis visit were hypocrites inasmuch as they would shelve it the day he left.
('38', 142, 7, 15, 307051) Did that indicate the progress of khadi?
('38', 142, 7, 16, 307092) Gandhiji said: Well, I do not know.
('38', 142, 7, 17, 307128) I know that I am selling khadi wherever I go, and there ends my work.
('38', 142, 7, 18, 307198) Supposing you purchase from me millions of rupees worth of khadi and sink it into the sea, the sale is not vitiated.
('38', 142, 7, 19, 307315) But the criticism is unfair.
('38', 142, 7, 20, 307344) I know that some wear khadi for the occasion, but they do not disguise the fact.
('38', 142, 7, 21, 307425) They appreciate the message of khadi, but they say they cannot exclusively wear it for a number of reasons.
('38', 142, 7, 22, 307533) Am I to tell them, You are no good.
('38', 142, 7, 23, 307569) I can do without your khadi? No, no.
('38', 142, 7, 24, 307606) My duty is to define our dharma in its fulness.
('38', 142, 7, 25, 307654) Their duty is to follow it as much as they can.
('38', 142, 7, 26, 307702) People deceive me, you say.
('38', 142, 7, 27, 307730) I do not understand how they can harm me even if they do.
('38', 142, 7, 28, 307788) I am but a self appointed agent of Daridranarayana and I shall take from you only what you can give me.

('38', 143, 0, 1, 308029) 144 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 143, 1, 2, 308071) You are good enough, they say, but your work has ruined the country. I am but an erring mortal and like any one of you I am full of shortcomings; therefore I beseech you to reject them and simply make the best of my capacity for service.
('38', 143, 1, 3, 308309) Turn my good points to account and reject the bad ones.
('38', 143, 1, 4, 308365) If you do not pick and choose and simply reject me wholesale, what will the world say to you?
('38', 143, 1, 5, 308459) Will you regret the service of a man as a carrier because he is blind?
('38', 143, 1, 6, 308530) As I said at Nasik, I fail to understand the shuddhi, tabligh and proselytization as they are carried on today.
('38', 143, 1, 7, 308642) I cannot understand a man changing the religion of his forefathers at the instance of another.
('38', 143, 1, 8, 308737) But that is my personal conviction.
('38', 143, 1, 9, 308773) No one need stop shuddhi, tabligh or proselytization at my instance.
('38', 143, 1, 10, 308842) My own duty is clear.
('38', 143, 1, 11, 308864) I must go on purifying myself and hoping that only thereby would I react on my surroundings.
('38', 143, 1, 12, 308957) It is my unshakable conviction that penance and self purification are the only means for the protection of Hinduism.
('38', 143, 1, 13, 309074) Do any amount of sangathan, only let not that sangathan be of the evil forces, let it be only of the forces of good.
('38', 143, 1, 14, 309191) You say I am partial to the Mussalmans.
('38', 143, 1, 15, 309231) So be it, though the Mussalmans do not admit it.
('38', 143, 1, 16, 309280) But my religion will not suffer by even an iota by reason of my partiality.
('38', 143, 1, 17, 309356) I shall have to answer my God and my Maker if I give anyone less than his due, but I am sure that He will bless me if He knows that I gave someone more than his due.
('38', 143, 1, 18, 309522) I ask you to understand me.
('38', 143, 1, 19, 309550) If my hand or heart has done anything more than was anyones due, you should be proud of it, rather than deplore it.
('38', 143, 1, 20, 309666) It should be a matter of pride to you as Hindus to think that there was amongst you at least one mad Gandhi who was not only just to the Mussalmans, but even went out of his way in giving them more than their due.
('38', 143, 1, 21, 309880) Hinduism is replete with instances of tolerance, sacrifice and forgiveness.
('38', 143, 1, 22, 309956) Think of the sacrifice of the Pandavas, think of the forgiveness of Yudhishthira.
('38', 143, 1, 23, 310038) Should it be a matter for sorrow for you, that there is at least one man who has tried to carry out the precept of Hinduism to the letter?
('38', 143, 1, 24, 310177) If there is anything in the charge that you are wearing khadi just to please me, and for show, I say for Gods sake do not do so.
('38', 143, 1, 25, 310306) I am not a Mahatma.
('38', 143, 1, 26, 310326) If I am one, the Mahatmaship is but the expression of some shakti 1. Pray do nothing for my sake.
('38', 143, 1, 27, 310424) I shuddered when

('38', 144, 1, 2, 310492) someone proposed that though I was silent I should exhibit myself for darshan 1. I assure you the words darshan and Mahatma stink in my nostrils.
('38', 144, 1, 3, 310638) I am unworthy of giving darshan.
('38', 144, 1, 4, 310671) Even like you I am a vessel of clay, liable to all the affections and passions that flesh is heir to.
('38', 144, 1, 5, 310773) How can I be fit to give you darshan?
('38', 144, 1, 6, 310811) One and only one darshan is necessary, viz., that of the nameless, formless, indefinable Absolute.
('38', 144, 1, 7, 310910) Try, if you can, to see Him everywhere, in a poor mans hut as in a palace, in a latrine as well as in a temple.
('38', 144, 1, 8, 311022) Have, if you will, the darshan of khadi and visualize its immense potentialities.
('38', 144, 1, 9, 311104) Dismiss the mortal frame called Gandhi from your mind.
('38', 144, 1, 10, 311159) Its darshan will be of no avail.

('38', 144, 4, 14, 311278) Haste is waste.
('38', 144, 4, 15, 311294) Let me do a few places thoroughly rather than many places indifferently.
('38', 144, 4, 16, 311367) You will have to remember that I have to do continuous travelling throughout the year.
('38', 144, 4, 17, 311454) My capacity and energy are limited.
('38', 144, 4, 18, 311490) I must therefore have three forty five minutes for three meals, one forty five minutes for bath, etc., and two forty five minutes for a quiet walk in the morning and evening.
('38', 144, 4, 19, 311665) I must be made to retire at 9 p.m., and I must have three hours for attending to correspon dence and editing, and I must have half an hour for sleep during day.
('38', 144, 4, 20, 311826) If you can give me these hours, I fancy that I shall not only bear the strain of travelling but go on almost indefinitely and shall improve in health.

('38', 145, 1, 3, 312332) I am not at all sorry you have gone to the Gurukul.
('38', 145, 1, 4, 312384) The Gurukuls are an honest attempt.
('38', 145, 1, 5, 312420) I want you to discuss these things fully with Ramdevji and others.
('38', 145, 1, 6, 312487) You will influence them when you speak to them with a loving heart.
('38', 145, 1, 7, 312555) We must measure people with their own measure and see how far they come up to it.
('38', 145, 1, 8, 312637) You do not need this caution.
('38', 145, 1, 9, 312667) But seeing that you have set a rigorous standard for yourself and you are in a strange environ ment, I am anxious for you not to lose your balance even by a hairs breadth.

('38', 145, 7, 18, 313200) MANILAL, I have your letter.
('38', 145, 7, 19, 313229) I do not want Sushila to make a resolve; I do not know her that well.
('38', 145, 7, 20, 313299) But you should acquaint yourself with her people.
('38', 145, 7, 21, 313349) They are a cultured family.
('38', 145, 7, 22, 313377) All of them wear khadi.
('38', 145, 7, 23, 313401) I agree it is difficult for you to wear khadi.
('38', 145, 7, 24, 313448) It will not be difficult for Sushila as long as she keeps up her Indian style with sari and other things.
('38', 145, 7, 25, 313554) A presentable khaddar dress can be had at a reasonable price.
('38', 145, 7, 26, 313616) People dressed in khadi are to be found now even in distant Edinburgh.
('38', 145, 8, 27, 313687) 1 From the reference to Manilals wedding and the message to Panditji in this and the succeeding two letters, it appears that all the three were written on the same date.
('38', 146, 0, 1, 313857) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 147
('38', 146, 1, 2, 313900) It is not my attempt to make recluses of you or Sushila, but I certainly intend to make you disciplined householders.
('38', 146, 1, 3, 314018) If I wanted to make you monks I would not have bothered about getting you married.
('38', 146, 1, 4, 314101) I would not disapprove if you sought your pleasure within limits.
('38', 146, 1, 5, 314167) In spite of all this you are free and should act as you please; I do not want to exercise the least pressure.
('38', 146, 1, 6, 314277) Jamnalalji has not turned a recluse, only he has given up a number of pleasures.
('38', 146, 1, 7, 314358) You are quite grown up and I do not look upon you as a child.
('38', 146, 1, 8, 314420) I have been taking steps after consulting you about everything.
('38', 146, 1, 9, 314484) Do let me know if you wish for any change in the marriage ceremony or for some merriment.
('38', 146, 1, 10, 314574) I have suggested and acted as I thought fit but I want to be as agreeable to you as I can while following my own code of conduct 1. I know marriage is a turning point in the life of a young man and woman.
('38', 146, 1, 11, 314779) I am also aware thatparents should not interfere in it.
('38', 146, 1, 12, 314835) Do not think yourself to be under any kind of pressure.
('38', 146, 1, 13, 314891) Do I need to be more frank?
('38', 146, 1, 14, 314919) Do I have to give any more reassurance?
('38', 146, 1, 15, 314959) Nanabhai has invited Panditji, so he should come with you.
('38', 146, 1, 16, 315018) Both of you can meet me by taking the Tapti Valley route; thereby you can also save some time.
('38', 146, 1, 17, 315113) But do what both of you find convenient.

('38', 146, 6, 23, 315344) The wedding may take place at 10 30. Evening would never suit me.
('38', 146, 6, 24, 315410) Why should you offer a dress to Manilal?
('38', 146, 6, 25, 315451) The dress he will have on, wont that do?
('38', 146, 6, 26, 315492) However, I would not hurt your feelings.

('38', 147, 6, 13, 316331) For the present take such work from Parasram as he can do.
('38', 147, 6, 14, 316390) Ask Panditji to be ready.
('38', 147, 6, 15, 316416) He should take a train from Sabarmati on the 5th morning to save time and money, and join me at Jalgaon by taking the Tapti Valley route.
('38', 147, 6, 16, 316554) It will do if Manilal also takes the same train.
('38', 147, 6, 17, 316603) But they may, if they want to, travel via Bombay.
('38', 147, 6, 18, 316653) Panditji should write to Nanabhai about the preparations to be made.
('38', 147, 6, 19, 316722) The marriage ceremony is to be performed on Sunday at 10 30 a.m.
('38', 147, 6, 20, 316787) I was under the impression that Ganeshs Christian name was John.
('38', 147, 6, 21, 316852) Because of this and because I had forgotten the name Ganesh, I wrote John.
('38', 147, 6, 22, 316927) 1 Give him this new letter in which I refer to him by the name of Ganesh.
('38', 147, 6, 23, 317001) And if the fellow can take a joke and would not mind his name being forgotten, give him the one which carries the name of John too.
('38', 147, 6, 24, 317133) Otherwise destroy that letter.
('38', 147, 6, 25, 317164) Now I do not have to worry about Rukhi.

('38', 148, 1, 4, 317688) We must take up that activity which involves no risk of loss.
('38', 148, 1, 5, 317750) For the lift too we shall collect the amount needed.
('38', 148, 1, 6, 317803) But I shall decide about it after I reach there on the 9th.
('38', 148, 1, 7, 317863) The amount from Mirabehn comes in regularly.
('38', 148, 1, 8, 317908) All of it is to be spent at the Ashram.
('38', 148, 1, 9, 317948) Since a year is over, we can now utilize the amount.

('38', 148, 1, 11, 318115) Are you now in a position to meet the demand for lifts and to set them up?
('38', 148, 1, 12, 318190) I have deliberately omitted to publish anything [about the lift].
('38', 148, 1, 13, 318256) Write to me if you want it to be publicized so that I can prepare an article for the next issue.
('38', 148, 1, 14, 318353) Let me know what I may write.
('38', 148, 1, 15, 318383) Have you now trained people to work the lift?
('38', 148, 1, 16, 318429) I believe I must mention the minimum weight of the animal that should go with each.
('38', 148, 1, 17, 318513) Why can we not use an old buffalo?
('38', 148, 1, 18, 318548) Why not a good or pliant bull?
('38', 148, 1, 19, 318579) There should be no error in our calculations.
('38', 148, 1, 20, 318625) I am afraid, we might have to depute our men in all places for quite some time.
('38', 148, 1, 21, 318705) But it will be all right if you have given thought to all this.
('38', 148, 1, 22, 318769) The same applies to hides and skins.
('38', 148, 1, 23, 318806) Let me have a copy of the pamphlet about this.
('38', 148, 1, 24, 318853) I will publish it after examining it.
('38', 148, 2, 25, 318891) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] A special letter for the Ashram is enclosed.

('38', 148, 4, 27, 319031) 132. LETTER TO ASHRAM MEMBERS
('38', 148, 5, 28, 319061) Silence Day, February 21, 1927 I see from the letters I get that attendance at the prayer is irregu lar and thin.
('38', 148, 5, 29, 319175) A general slackness is also creeping into the spinning.
('38', 148, 5, 30, 319231) Spinning and prayer are the two beacons for us.
('38', 148, 5, 31, 319279) If we do not keep an eye on them, we will be able to do no credit either to the Ashram or to ourselves.
('38', 148, 5, 32, 319383) It is one thing not to do them after deciding right from the beginning that we would not engage in either of them, and another to omit doing them after undertaking them.
('38', 148, 5, 33, 319553) In my opinion, he who approves of neither can achieve nothing at the
('38', 149, 0, 1, 319622) 150 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 149, 1, 2, 319664) Ashram, since we regard them both as essential religious activities.
('38', 149, 1, 3, 319733) Those who, while approving of them, grow lax in their practice will develop a general laxity.
('38', 149, 1, 4, 319827) If we wish to learn to insist on truth and to experience the strength it gives, we must never omit to perform the two aforesaid rites.
('38', 149, 1, 5, 319962) Both require faith on our part.
('38', 149, 1, 6, 319994) To a certain extent we can adduce rational arguments in support of both, but in the last resort faith alone can satisfy us.
('38', 149, 1, 7, 320118) One sometimes feels that nothing is gained by attendance at prayers, that one is unable to concentrate attention, one feels a sense of lethargy, and so on.
('38', 149, 1, 8, 320274) These things cannot be reasoned out; they can be dispelled only by faith.
('38', 149, 1, 9, 320348) The Gita recommends faith alone when it speaks of dispassionate action.
('38', 149, 1, 10, 320420) An effort is never wasted.
('38', 149, 1, 11, 320447) It is an act of faith to believe in the ultimate triumph of truth in the face of failures, and to follow truth dispassionately.
('38', 149, 1, 12, 320575) We should have the same attitude to spinning as to prayer.
('38', 149, 1, 13, 320634) It is not for me to calculate how this much spinning would benefit me or the country.
('38', 149, 1, 14, 320720) One may not see any immediate benefit from spinning but one must stick to ones belief that it is going to bring some benefit.
('38', 149, 1, 15, 320846) The point is to learn to stick to our resolve.
('38', 149, 1, 16, 320893) The two external and common activities of prayer and spinning are likely to develop this tenacity.
('38', 149, 1, 17, 320992) If we are lax in these activities, when shall we learn to stand firm on truth?
('38', 149, 1, 18, 321071) I therefore appeal to all, young and old, not to neglect these two activities.
('38', 149, 2, 19, 321150) Blessings from BAPU

('38', 149, 5, 22, 321267) SHOLAPUR, Monday, Maha Vad 5 [February 21, 1927]
('38', 149, 6, 23, 321316) SISTERS, I have your letter.
('38', 149, 6, 24, 321345) I find that carding and other work has been going on well.
('38', 149, 6, 25, 321404) If you persevere in the same way, you will make good progress within a short time.
('38', 149, 6, 26, 321487) The effect of regular work is like that of regular food.
('38', 149, 6, 27, 321544) It nourishes the soul.
('38', 149, 6, 28, 321567) But, even as over eating spoils ones health, so excessive work at a time wears out ones spirit.
('38', 150, 0, 1, 321663) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 151
('38', 150, 1, 2, 321706) We are in Sholapur today.
('38', 150, 1, 3, 321732) It is a big city.
('38', 150, 1, 4, 321750) There are five mills here.
('38', 150, 1, 5, 321777) The biggest of them belongs to Morarji Gokuldas.
('38', 150, 1, 6, 321826) His grandson Shantikumar is still a youth so far as age goes, but he has a great soul.
('38', 150, 1, 7, 321913) He loves khadi and wears only khadi.
('38', 150, 1, 8, 321950) I do not mean that this is his greatest virtue.
('38', 150, 1, 9, 321998) He is sympathetic, generous, humble, devoted to God and truthful.
('38', 150, 1, 10, 322064) He has the virtue that his name indicates, i.e., he is calmness incarnate.
('38', 150, 1, 11, 322139) I am very glad that such a jewel amongst men is found in a multi millionaire family.
('38', 150, 1, 12, 322224) I was not acquainted with his wife.
('38', 150, 1, 13, 322260) Yesterday, while I took my meal, I made her sit down by me and talked to her to my hearts content.
('38', 150, 1, 14, 322359) I suggested to her that she should take to public work like her husband.
('38', 150, 1, 15, 322432) I cited all of you as an example to her.
('38', 150, 1, 16, 322473) Was I right in doing so or was it only my conceit?
('38', 150, 1, 17, 322524) You alone know whether all of you are devoted to service.
('38', 150, 1, 18, 322582) Anyhow that is what escaped my lips.
('38', 150, 1, 19, 322619) It is up to you to justify my statement.

('38', 150, 5, 23, 322754) [February 21, 1927] 1
('38', 150, 6, 24, 322776) JAMNALAL, I have your letter.
('38', 150, 6, 25, 322806) I am returning herewith both the letters from Ghanshyamdas.
('38', 150, 6, 26, 322866) Because I have faith in his word I am not afraid that he would marry again.
('38', 150, 6, 27, 322942) I want you to come to Belgaum on 25 26 and also to present yourself at the Ashram on the 11th.
('38', 150, 6, 28, 323037) There is much work to be done at both the places.
('38', 150, 6, 29, 323087) It would be worth the while if you could stay at the Ashram from the 9th to 13th.
('38', 150, 6, 30, 323169) You may also stay with me at the time of the Gurukul [Convocation] when Ghanshyamdas too proposes to be present.
('38', 150, 6, 31, 323282) It depends more on your own convenience in view of the other things you have to attend to.
('38', 150, 6, 32, 323373) What is Kamala doing?
('38', 150, 6, 33, 323395) I am worried on her account.
('38', 150, 6, 34, 323424) This does not mean you too should start worrying.

('38', 151, 7, 11, 323936) I am a little worried about her.
('38', 151, 7, 12, 323969) We are in Sholapur today.
('38', 151, 7, 13, 323995) Shantikumar is looking after us very well.

('38', 151, 12, 22, 324326) Because I trust your word I am not afraid of your reconsidering it.
('38', 151, 12, 23, 324394) I trust you also in the matter of the Assembly.
('38', 151, 12, 24, 324442) But in view of the prevailing atmosphere there it is difficult to remain absolutely independent.
('38', 151, 12, 25, 324539) On the question of sangathan I hold the same views that I have expressed.
('38', 151, 12, 26, 324613) Organization is certainly not the remedy for the case,
('38', 151, 13, 27, 324668) 1 From the contents it is evident that the letter was written on this date, a silence day, when Gandhiji was at Sholapur.

('38', 152, 1, 3, 324916) Here the remedy is either tapascharya or individual courage.
('38', 152, 1, 4, 324977) As long as we remain cowards no wonder our women fall into the hands of the lecherous.
('38', 152, 1, 5, 325064) I know of a Hindu prince in whose territory no young girl was safe and the husband and the father used to be helpless.
('38', 152, 1, 6, 325183) But then this is a complicated problem.
('38', 152, 1, 7, 325223) Please do come to the Gurukul if you can.
('38', 152, 1, 8, 325265) I wish to have you with me for a fortnight; we cannot dispose of such matters in a day.

('38', 153, 5, 7, 326218) DEAR SIR PURUSHOTTAMDAS1, As it appears to be more convenient for you to handle English letters I am sending you this in English.
('38', 153, 5, 8, 326348) Though I have myself yet written nothing about currency matters, perhaps you are aware that I have been closely following the agitation 2, that is, as closely as I can, in spite of incessant travelling.
('38', 153, 5, 9, 326551) I have been studying the question carefully and carrying on an active correspondence with experts chiefly Messrs Madon and Wadia.
('38', 153, 5, 10, 326681) The latter has sent me a draft bill which I understand he has circulated among the members of the Assembly.
('38', 153, 5, 11, 326789) Will you please let me know whether that Bill meets your approval?
('38', 153, 5, 12, 326856) If a pure gold standard is established, free mints opened, and a Reserve Bank established, does not the question of ratio disappear altogether?
('38', 153, 5, 13, 327000) Will not things right themselves?
('38', 153, 5, 14, 327034) Whereas if the ratio is fixed at 1 to 15 and all questions about gold, currency, mints and Reserve Bank shelved or decided in accordance with the recommen dation of the Commission, will it not be worse than the existing state of things?
('38', 153, 5, 15, 327271) Yours sincerely, M. K. G. SIR PURUSHOTTAMDAS THAKURDAS BOMBAY

('38', 154, 3, 4, 327739) DEAR FRIEND, I have your latest letter for which I thank you.
('38', 154, 3, 5, 327801) What do you say to this letter?
('38', 154, 3, 6, 327833) At the time of replying please return the enclosure.
('38', 154, 3, 7, 327886) I note what you say about Mr. Shroff.
('38', 154, 3, 8, 327924) Do you not think that there is considerable force in what Prof.
('38', 154, 3, 9, 327988) Wadia says, namely, that the ratio question should not be separated from the permanent question of standard; or do you say that since there is a statutory definition of the rupee in terms of gold, we should be entirely satisfied if the ratio is satisfactorily settled and the other recommendations 1 of the Commission either shelved or given effect to just as they are.
('38', 154, 3, 10, 328358) In other words, if you had the choice what will you do?
('38', 154, 3, 11, 328414) Have the ratio fixed at 1 to 15 and the status quo retained in all other respects?
('38', 154, 3, 12, 328497) Or the ratio fixed at 1 to 50 and gold Bullion standard with the Reserve Bank mentioned in the Commission established?
('38', 154, 3, 13, 328616) Or a pure gold standard established, mints reopened for coining gold mohors freely and a central bank given such as Prof.
('38', 154, 3, 14, 328738) Wadia suggests, leaving the ratio undisturbed by any statutory action?

('38', 155, 6, 13, 330064) I have no experience of your knowledge of the English language.
('38', 155, 6, 14, 330128) If you are confident of your ability for this work, you should go to Jamshedpur, look about yourself, and then make the final decision.
('38', 155, 6, 15, 330264) As to the Ashram, you can come over at any time you please.

('38', 156, 4, 7, 331033) February 22, 1927
('38', 156, 5, 8, 331051) [Addressing] both the Hindus and Mussalmans gathered in the vast courtyard of the famous Sharana Basappa Temple which still bore the marks of the mob fury of 1924 2, Gandhiji said: My heart burns with agony when I see young men, dressed in foreign caps and clothes.
('38', 156, 5, 9, 331317) It is surprising that they do not see that, whilst the rupees that they spend on foreign caps are wasted, the annas that they need spend on khadi caps all go to the pockets of the poor.
('38', 156, 5, 10, 331503) The man who shuts his eyes to the poor of his land and seeks to befriend the poor of the world must be mad indeed.
('38', 156, 5, 11, 331618) God will find him guilty of arrogating to himself His function.
('38', 156, 5, 12, 331682) The Hindu who recites his Gayatri regularly and the Mussalman who says his namaz five times a day are doing so in vain, if they have no corner in their hearts for the poor of their land.
('38', 156, 5, 13, 331869) This is the message I would leave with the Hindus and Mussalmans of this place.
('38', 156, 5, 14, 331949) Much as I would like to pour out my agony before you, I know that it will be a cry in the wilderness.
('38', 156, 5, 15, 332051) I therefore daily send out my prayer to God: Lord, do somehow deliver us from this confla gration. But I should be untrue to my creed if as a believing and satyagrahi Hindu I disguised from you the feelings within me.
('38', 156, 5, 16, 332269) When I went into the temple I was shown the spot where the idol was removed and the Nandi 3 was desecrated.
('38', 156, 5, 17, 332377) I tell you the sight pained me.
('38', 156, 5, 18, 332409) You may call me an idolator if you will.
('38', 156, 5, 19, 332450) I see God everywhere and in everything.
('38', 156, 5, 20, 332490) I tell you God would never approve of those acts of desecration.
('38', 156, 5, 21, 332555) Whilst in Yeravda Jail, I read Maulana Shiblis Life of the Prophet, I also read Usva e Sahaba and can say that those who did

('38', 157, 1, 2, 332812) the acts were wrong, that Islam never sanctions such things and they were guilty before God and man.
('38', 157, 1, 3, 332913) When I heard of these things I was convinced that the matter had passed out of human hands.
('38', 157, 1, 4, 333005) If there were men who devoted all their time and energy to the cause of Hindu Muslim unity I at least was one of them, but when my efforts did not seem to bear any fruit I threw myself on God.
('38', 157, 1, 5, 333198) When the saints and godfearing people of Islam saw that there was discord and strife after the passing away of the Prophet, they dissociated themselves from them, migrated to Egypt, Persia and other lands and there retired into seclusion and sent up their prayers to God.
('38', 157, 1, 6, 333470) It is these saints that have kept Islam alive.
('38', 157, 1, 7, 333517) How often have I wished to retire thus into seclusion!
('38', 157, 1, 8, 333572) And though I know that history will take note of my efforts as those of one who was a servant of God, who committed Himalayan blunders but who had also the courage to confess them and repent for them, I know that today I can do no better than be silent on this question.
('38', 157, 1, 9, 333843) But if you will not listen to me in that matter, you certainly will not disdain to think of the millions of the poor amongst you.
('38', 157, 1, 10, 333973) Do you know that many of the spinners in Bihar, Bengal and the Punjab out of the 50,000 spinners in India for whom the A.I.S.A. finds employment, are Mussalmans?
('38', 157, 1, 11, 334135) Have you read the heart rending tales of woe of some of them?
('38', 157, 1, 12, 334197) One of the workers in Gujarat asked a Mussalman woman aged 65 as to why she bothered to spin when spinning brought her only an anna per day.
('38', 157, 1, 13, 334338) She said the fact that there was someone to give her an anna in return for the yarn she spun convinced her that there surely must be God somewhere.
('38', 157, 1, 14, 334486) Fight, therefore, as much as you wish, but when a man like me appeals for help, pray forget your quarrels and your hostilities and do something for the cause he pleads.

('38', 158, 8, 10, 335058) [February 23, 1927] 2
('38', 158, 9, 11, 335080) At Pandharpur the people in charge of the temple had somehow got the report that Gandhiji was going there with a European friend and they were terribly exercised as to what they should do if Gandhiji insisted on entering the temple with the friend as he did at Banaras.
('38', 158, 9, 12, 335350) They must have been relieved to find that there was no such friend in our party.
('38', 158, 9, 13, 335431) But Gandhiji made a pointed reference to this matter in his speech.
('38', 158, 9, 14, 335499) He said: I am sorry that neither the Buddhist friend who was with me at Banaras nor the untouchable girl I have adopted is with me.
('38', 158, 9, 15, 335631) But you may be sure that I should not have visited the temple without them if they had been with me.
('38', 158, 9, 16, 335732) Had I left them out, I should have been guilty of insulting Vithoba Himself.
('38', 158, 9, 17, 335809) I would not mind even an atheist entering our temple, for I know that God can take care of Himself.
('38', 158, 9, 18, 335909) Who is there in the world who can insult the God in the image?

('38', 159, 1, 2, 336132) the lady friend who was with me is a Buddhist and therefore a Hindu.
('38', 159, 1, 3, 336201) If she had no right to enter the temple, who else can have it?
('38', 159, 1, 4, 336264) I have visited many places of pilgrimage and I have been pained to see hypocrisy and cupidity there.
('38', 159, 1, 5, 336365) It is necessary first to purify the drunken and dissolute worshippers in charge of some of these tem ples.
('38', 159, 1, 6, 336472) If the things continue as they are today, if we do not bestir our selves and go through the necessary penance and cleansing and self purification, I tell you that not even the 22 crores of Hindus can keep Hinduism alive.
('38', 159, 1, 7, 336693) The Himalayas are spotlessly snow white in virtue of the spotless glory of the countless sages who laid down their lives performing penance in their caves.

('38', 159, 3, 11, 336968) Sir Mahomed Habibullah and his colleagues are to be congratulated upon having secured a settlement that is honourable to both parties.
('38', 159, 3, 12, 337103) It is not the best that could be conceived, but it is the best that was possible.
('38', 159, 3, 13, 337185) I doubt if any other deputation could have done more.
('38', 159, 3, 14, 337239) The Class Areas Bill, which brought about the Conference and round which the battle raged, is dead and gone.
('38', 159, 3, 15, 337348) The Right Hon.
('38', 159, 3, 16, 337363) Srinivasa Sastri, who when the deputation sailed for South Africa was of all members the most communicative and had warned us not to expect much, did not conceal at the end of the labours of the Conference his satisfaction at the result.
('38', 159, 3, 17, 337601) A perusal of the settlement warrants the satisfaction.
('38', 159, 3, 18, 337656) But like all compromises this one is not without its danger points.
('38', 159, 3, 19, 337724) The dropping of the Class Areas Bill is balanced by repatria tion, re emerging as re emigration.
('38', 159, 3, 20, 337821) If the name is more dignified, it is also more dangerous.
('38', 159, 3, 21, 337879) Repatriation could only be to India.
('38', 159, 3, 22, 337916) Re emigra tion can be to any country.
('38', 159, 3, 23, 337954) The following sentence in the settlement clearly points to that interpretation:The Union Government there fore will organize a scheme of assisted emigration to India or other countries where Western standards are not required. This assisted emigration to other countries I hold to be dangerous, for there is no knowing what may happen to the poor ignorant men going to an unknown land, where they would be utter strangers.
('38', 159, 3, 24, 338377) Such countries as would take them would only be either Fiji or British Guiana.
('38', 159, 3, 25, 338456) Neither

('38', 160, 1, 2, 338507) has a good name in India.
('38', 160, 1, 3, 338533) It is decidedly a disadvantage to have been party to assisted emigration to any other part of the world.
('38', 160, 1, 4, 338638) The good point about this assisted emigration is that whereas before the settlement the repatriates lost their domicile, the re emi grants now retain it and lose it only if they absent themselves so long as to warrant the inference that there is no intention on their part to return to South Africa.
('38', 160, 1, 5, 338938) How many assisted emigrants can hope to refund the assistance in money they might have received or how many can hope to return with their families is a different question.
('38', 160, 1, 6, 339110) The non forfeiture clause is clearly designed not so much to guarantee a substantial right as not to hurt national self respect.
('38', 160, 1, 7, 339239) The annexure, containing a summary of conclusions reached by the Round Table Conference on the Indian question in South Africa, is a remarkable document betraying in every paragraph a heroic attempt to reconcile conflicting interests and sentiments.
('38', 160, 1, 8, 339489) The industrious reader will have no difficulty in discovering hopeful paragraphs.
('38', 160, 1, 9, 339571) I shall therefore content myself with drawing attention to a paragraph that is fraught with grave danger.
('38', 160, 1, 10, 339677) The Union Government is to take special steps under the Public Health Act for an investigation into the sanitary and housing conditions in and around Durban, which will include the question of the limitation of sale of municipal lands subject to restrictive conditions.
('38', 160, 1, 11, 339947) I do not know what is aimed at in this paragraph, but my suspecting mindand my suspicion is based upon previous bitter experience of interpretations, warranted and unwarranted, that a strong party places upon agree ments with a weak party to the latters disadvantageconjures up all kinds of frightful consequences arising from this proposed committee and limitation.
('38', 160, 1, 12, 340314) Already the Durban Corporation has been invested with powers which it has utilized for the suppression of its Indian citizens.
('38', 160, 1, 13, 340441) So far as I know a committee can bring to light nothing that is not known to the Corporation or the Government.
('38', 160, 1, 14, 340553) The appointment of an advisory committee of Indians may be simple padding.
('38', 160, 1, 15, 340628) The Health Committee may bring in a hysterical report, as a previous committee to my knowledge has done, and limitations may be put upon the purchase of municipal lands by Indians which may cramp the Indian community residing in Durban.
('38', 160, 1, 16, 340865) Nor do I like the paragraph which seems to imply that provincial Governments are at liberty to take any action they might against the Indian settlers without
('38', 161, 0, 1, 341023) 162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 161, 1, 2, 341065) reference to the Central Government.
('38', 161, 1, 3, 341102) But the compromise is acceptable in spite of the dangers referred to by me, not so much for what has been actually achieved as for the almost sudden transformation of the atmosphere in South Africa from one of remorseless hostility towards Indians to that of a generous toleration and from complete social ostracism to that of admission of Indians to social functions.
('38', 161, 1, 4, 341471) Mr. Andrews sends me a glowing account of the utmost cordiality with which the Indian members of the Deputation were received alike by the Government and the people, how local Indians were able to gain entry to the most fashionable hotel in Cape Town without any let or hindrance and how the Europeans in South Africa were flocking to him to know all about the Indian Deputation and the Indian question.
('38', 161, 1, 5, 341875) If this atmosphere of goodwill and sociability is kept up and encouraged, the settlement can be used as a solid foundation for erecting a beautiful temple of freedom for the Indian settlers in South Africa.
('38', 161, 1, 6, 342082) But the success of the settlement very largely depends upon the selection of the Consul or the Commissioner who will be selected to represent the Government of India.
('38', 161, 1, 7, 342249) He must be a person of eminence, great ability and great strength of character, and in my opinion, he must be an Indian.
('38', 161, 1, 8, 342370) They very fact of his being an Indian will strike the imagination of the European population and raise the Indian settlers in European estimation.
('38', 161, 1, 9, 342517) He will reach the heart of Indians in a way no Englishman, not even perhaps Mr. Andrews, can, and if a man can be selected who will command the equal esteem of the Union Government we need not fear the future.
('38', 161, 1, 10, 342727) Such a man in my humble opinion is Mr. Srinivasa Sastri.
('38', 161, 1, 11, 342784) I cannot conclude this hasty survey of the settlement without placing on record my deepest conviction that the happy result is predominantly due to the ceaseless and prayerful labours of that godly self effacing Englishman, Charlie Andrews.

('38', 161, 4, 14, 343059) A SIMPLE SUGGESTION During my tour I observe that at some of the meetings volunteers thoughtlessly begin distribution of papers, such as copies of address, etc., just after the guest has arrived and the address has begun to be read.
('38', 161, 4, 15, 343292) They do not realize that this creates a fresh disturbance in already noisy and restless meetings.
('38', 161, 4, 16, 343390) If papers are to be distributed, they should be distributed before the proceedings
('38', 162, 0, 1, 343473) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 163
('38', 162, 1, 2, 343516) commence.
('38', 162, 1, 3, 343526) It is not even realized that if papers are distributed, they should be distributed to all who want them.
('38', 162, 1, 4, 343631) In mass meetings such distribution is impossible unless thousands of copies are available.
('38', 162, 1, 5, 343722) In my opinion this would mean an utterly useless waste of public money.
('38', 162, 1, 6, 343794) Whatever is absolutely necessary will surely be printed by local papers and the public should be satisfied with what the papers give.
('38', 162, 1, 7, 343928) If they are unable to follow the proceedings without the papers it would not be a bad plan to sell such papers when there would be no question of favouritism.
('38', 162, 1, 8, 344087) All those who wish to possess copies can have them for a trifling charge to cover printing expenses and a small addition so as to form a contribution, however small, to the expense of organizing meetings.
('38', 162, 2, 9, 344292) STEWARDS OF THE NATION
('38', 162, 3, 10, 344315) Much trouble, time and money can be saved by a little forethought.
('38', 162, 3, 11, 344382) As it is, I often notice a reckless waste of public funds in connection with these meetings.
('38', 162, 3, 12, 344475) Let organizers of all meetings, but especially of khadi meetings, realize that we are the poorest country in the world, millions of whom are semi starved, if only because their earnings are less even than three pice per day.
('38', 162, 3, 13, 344700) Let organizers therefore understand, as stewards for the nation, it is their duty to spend public funds like misers and never to spend a pie without thought and without necessity.
('38', 162, 3, 14, 344880) Organizers of khadi meetings should further realize that every pice collected is a pice meant for the starving millions and so one pice means often a days earning for a widow.
('38', 162, 3, 15, 345056) They must not therefore spend where they need not.
('38', 162, 3, 16, 345107) For instance, they spend money on paper decorations.
('38', 162, 3, 17, 345160) This is no time for decora tions.
('38', 162, 3, 18, 345194) Let them save as much as they can by avoiding all decorations save only those which may be required to attract peoples attention.
('38', 162, 3, 19, 345324) In that case they can think of several artistic things which cost nothing or very little.
('38', 162, 3, 20, 345414) Thus they can have flags and buntings out of waste khaddar.
('38', 162, 3, 21, 345474) We are now going in for extensive tailoring in connection with khaddar sales.
('38', 162, 3, 22, 345552) There is always much waste material in a tailors shop which he throws away.
('38', 162, 3, 23, 345628) Now every part of this waste can be used for buntings which unlike paper buntings can be preserved for further use.
('38', 163, 0, 1, 345744) 164 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 163, 1, 2, 345786) WRITE YOUR ADDRESSES Flowers may be avoided altogether and yarn garlands may be presented.
('38', 163, 1, 3, 345877) Yarn must not be damaged by being tied into knots.
('38', 163, 1, 4, 345928) It can be presented in its natural condition so that it can be subsequently used for weaving or any similar purpose.
('38', 163, 1, 5, 346045) Money can also be saved by avoiding the printing of addresses.
('38', 163, 1, 6, 346108) The best calligraphist among the organizers can write out the address on simple handmade paper and the paper can be nicely sewn on to a piece of khaddar, or if a little volunteer boy or girl would embroider the letters on a piece of khaddar it would be still better, the thread for embroidery, too, being hand spun.
('38', 163, 1, 7, 346424) Such work will be at once artistic and even valuable.
('38', 163, 1, 8, 346478) I have stolen the idea from the remarkable way in which Babu Mahendra Prasads daughter Rama had embroidered for her father the address presented by the Chapra Municipality of which he is Chairman.
('38', 163, 1, 9, 346675) It cost the Municipality nothing and I have become possessor of a work of art which will adorn the museum which Adhya pak Malkani has brought into being in the Gujarat National College.
('38', 163, 1, 10, 346861) AVOID SILVER CASKETS Expensive caskets are not required, for I have no use for them nor have I any room to keep them in.
('38', 163, 1, 11, 346982) Latterly I have been putting to auction every expensive casket received by me and handing the proceeds to the All India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund.
('38', 163, 1, 12, 347128) Although these auctions have invariably proved profitable in that they have fetched much more than their intrinsic value it will not be proper to present caskets for the purpose of securing fancy prices.
('38', 163, 1, 13, 347332) It will be a good exercise for organizers if they must give their khaddar addresses in caskets to find out something cheap, local and artistic.
('38', 163, 1, 14, 347476) NOT A PLEASURE TRIP Well has Gangadharrao said that mine is not a pleasure trip, but a business tour during which I expect to do substantial business for my principal Daridranarayana.
('38', 163, 1, 15, 347660) Every function therefore should be in fitting with that setting.
('38', 163, 1, 16, 347725) I have observed that often more local men travel with me than are necessary for the purpose of the mission and that motor cars are hired without due regard to economy.
('38', 163, 1, 17, 347893) Every item of expenditure should be previously and carefully thought out.
('38', 163, 1, 18, 347967) Unless we do so we shall not raise into being an efficient, economical organization calculated to serve the starving millions and we shall be guilty of the same charge, no matter on however small a scale, of
('38', 164, 0, 1, 348175) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 165
('38', 164, 1, 2, 348218) extravagance that we legitimately bring against the Government.
('38', 164, 1, 3, 348282) Kitson burners should be avoided whenever possible.
('38', 164, 1, 4, 348334) I notice, too, a lavish expenditure on feeding.
('38', 164, 1, 5, 348382) Those who travel with me do not do so to be entertained.
('38', 164, 1, 6, 348439) It is enough to provide clean lodging and clean food.
('38', 164, 1, 7, 348493) Indeed I often feel like copying for the whole of my company the excellent example of Mr. Bharucha who always insists on carrying his own food with him.
('38', 164, 1, 8, 348646) We spend much too much money and time upon food.
('38', 164, 1, 9, 348695) It grieves me to see people sending for parcels of fruit from Bombay or Calcutta.
('38', 164, 1, 10, 348777) Much of this expense is wholly unnecessary.
('38', 164, 1, 11, 348821) Some fruit is no doubt an essential part of my dietary and unless obtainable locally, something has no doubt to be imported.
('38', 164, 1, 12, 348946) But I am sure that the expense incurred in bringing fruit can at least he reduced by 75 per cent.
('38', 164, 1, 13, 349044) But, argue over zealous friends, why should not people who love you express their regard in some such loving acts of service?
('38', 164, 1, 14, 349170) They will not spend money otherwise, nor will they give you all the money that they spend for your personal comfort.
('38', 164, 1, 15, 349287) Let them therefore have the joy of spending some little money for you. The argument is no doubt flattering, but wholly unconvincing.
('38', 164, 1, 16, 349420) TRANSMUTATION INTO SERVICE If those who love cannot transfer their love to the thing for which I stand, their love is blind and of little value.
('38', 164, 1, 17, 349565) I do not know if one should live to provide mere enjoyment for friends.
('38', 164, 1, 18, 349637) Friendship means loving mutual service, and sometimes it is a positive disservice to indulge ones friends and to expose them to temptations.
('38', 164, 1, 19, 349778) And if there are friends who would spend lavishly for providing luxuries for me, but would not spend for the cause I espouse, it is my clear duty to resist such luxuries.
('38', 164, 1, 20, 349949) Friends to be friends must first provide me with necessaries of life before they think of indulging me with luxuries; and khaddar work is a vital necessary of life for me, more vital than food.
('38', 164, 1, 21, 350143) Reception Committees please note.
('38', 164, 1, 22, 350177) AUCTION OF GARLANDS
('38', 164, 2, 23, 350197) The foregoing paragraphs were written, or rather dictated at the halts before we reached Ahmednagar at which latter place, there was an imposing meeting where there were several addresses presented, the Municipal address being in a beautiful silver cylinder.
('38', 164, 2, 24, 350456) The represen tatives of each body brought also expensive flower garlands.
('38', 164, 2, 25, 350530) Mr. Firodia who presented the inevitable purse excused himself for its
('38', 165, 0, 1, 350601) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 165, 1, 2, 350643) smallness by saying that Ahmednagar was a famine ridden tract.
('38', 165, 1, 3, 350706) When therefore I began my reply 1 I could not help noticing the contrast between the palatial surroundings, the expensive ceremonial and the statement of famine conditions.
('38', 165, 1, 4, 350879) I told the audience that what was true of Ahmednagar was true of the whole of India.
('38', 165, 1, 5, 350964) Was not India a famine ridden land?
('38', 165, 1, 6, 351000) But the fact did not prevent accumulation of wealth on the part of a few.
('38', 165, 1, 7, 351074) We the city dwellers lived upon the exploitation of the famine stricken villagers and the Khaddar movement was in tended somewhat to redress the wrong and to make some slight return to the millions whom we were exploiting.
('38', 165, 1, 8, 351297) I therefore suggested that the acknowledgment of the fact that Ahmed nagar was a famine area made it doubly the duty of its well to do citizens to give more rather than less.
('38', 165, 1, 9, 351472) I told them also that it would ill become me to accept for myself such caskets and rich floral tributes.
('38', 165, 1, 10, 351577) I told them further that believing as I did that plants were as much endowed with life as we were ourselves, I did not like the unnecessary plucking of a single flower.
('38', 165, 1, 11, 351746) But in a place like Ahmed nagar my dislike was heightened by the reminder that I was a self chosen representative of the very famine stricken millions whom Mr. Firodia had mentioned.
('38', 165, 1, 12, 351929) Every rupee spent upon unnecessary things meant a deprivation of the livelihood of 16 famishing women and I therefore suggested that they should auction the silver casket as also the flowers, and if my remarks went home they would pay not the market value of the casket and the flowers but they would pay for the sentiment that the things would carry with them.
('38', 165, 1, 13, 352291) The auctioning was entrusted naturally to the Chairman of the Municipality, Khan Bahadur Dorab seth.
('38', 165, 1, 14, 352392) The casket was knocked down to Sheth Magniramji the local philanthropist for Rs. 1,001 and the garlands and the bouquets were auctioned separately under the same able management and they fetched in all Rs. 502. The result of my appeal went beyond the meeting and the citizens seemed to catch the spirit of my address to them, and the purse of Rs. 1,700 for which Mr. Firodia had apolo gized went up to nearly Rs. 6,000 apart from a brisk sale of khadi at the meeting.
('38', 165, 1, 15, 352860) Future organizers beware!
('38', 165, 1, 16, 352886) I warn them that they need not present me with flowers and rich caskets, but if they do I shall assume

('38', 166, 1, 2, 353072) that they are presented for the purpose of being auctioned and in order that their contribution to the poor peoples fund may be substantially increased.
('38', 166, 1, 3, 353225) TILAK SWARAJ FUND During the Maharashtra tour at one or two meetings I was asked what had become of the crore collected for Tilak Swaraj Fund.
('38', 166, 1, 4, 353368) 1 The questioners had every right to put this question even though they might not have contributed a pie to the Fund.
('38', 166, 1, 5, 353486) A public fund becomes public property and therefore every member of the public is entitled to know in detail the administration of such funds.
('38', 166, 1, 6, 353629) I therefore answered the question fairly exhaustively.
('38', 166, 1, 7, 353684) The gist of my answer will bear repetition although the question has been answered in these pages already.
('38', 166, 1, 8, 353791) The accounts have been published regularly by the All India Congress Committee.
('38', 166, 1, 9, 353871) Copies of the audited accounts can be had at any time from the Congress Secretaries or the Treasurers.
('38', 166, 1, 10, 353974) Every pie has been accounted for.
('38', 166, 1, 11, 354008) There is no doubt that in some instances those to whom funds were entrusted were not faithful to the trust, but that is as much as to say that the Congress like all human institutions is an imperfect body having in its fold all sorts of men.
('38', 166, 1, 12, 354250) I know of no institution in the world which does not have dishonest agents.
('38', 166, 1, 13, 354326) The Congress is no exception.
('38', 166, 1, 14, 354356) But I can say this that no loss has been sustained beyond what a most careful merchant suffers.
('38', 166, 1, 15, 354452) The little loss that had been sustained is due not to negligence, but has occurred inspite of vigilant inspection and auditing.
('38', 166, 1, 16, 354580) It should be further borne in mind that the Congress has had in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and in Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj an incorruptible working Secretary and an incorruptible working Treasurer respectively.
('38', 166, 1, 17, 354784) Moreover 75 per cent of the funds were administered locally by local representatives who had assisted in raising the funds and who were trusted by the people.
('38', 166, 1, 18, 354943) Lastly, the largest amounts were mostly earmarked and controlled by the donors, subject no doubt to the conditions that they were to be used only for purposes coming within the programme of non co operation and the accounts were to be open to inspection by Congress agents.
('38', 166, 1, 19, 355217) Personally, I have absolutely no regret about having raised the Fund and my conscience is clear as to its administration.

('38', 167, 1, 3, 355546) The Fund has served an immense national purpose.
('38', 167, 1, 4, 355595) The tremendous organization that came into being all of a sudden could not have been created without this great national Fund to which both rich and poor contributed so handsomely.

('38', 168, 5, 19, 357978) He lived in Karachi in recent years.
('38', 168, 5, 20, 358015) He was a great devotee of Shrimad Rajchan dra.
('38', 168, 5, 21, 358062) Ranchhodbhai had perfect faith in the latters teachings.
('38', 168, 5, 22, 358119) I have seen him shedding tears of joy even at the mention of Raychandbhai.
('38', 168, 5, 23, 358194) All those who knew him and came in touch with him will certainly feel grieved at his demise.
('38', 168, 5, 24, 358287) As for himself, he has departed after fulfilling his mission.
('38', 168, 5, 25, 358349) He always worked unobtrusively in the public life of Karachi.
('38', 168, 5, 26, 358411) He did not care for fame; his only desire was to work.

('38', 169, 9, 16, 359541) MALVAN, February, 28 1927
('38', 169, 10, 17, 359567) MIRA, I have two letters from you.
('38', 169, 10, 18, 359602) I have no doubt in my mind that a vow is like a ruddera life regulator.
('38', 169, 10, 19, 359674) And just as a rudderless ship is lost, so is a life without a vow a lost life.
('38', 169, 10, 20, 359753) For after all a vow means a religious determination to carry out a decision for self restraint even at the cost of ones life.
('38', 169, 10, 21, 359879) I should therefore welcome your desire to take what is perhaps the supremest vow for a man or a woman.
('38', 169, 10, 22, 359982) But if it is taken let it be taken after the maturest deliberation.
('38', 169, 10, 23, 360050) It would be wrong on my part to

('38', 170, 1, 2, 360125) prevent you from taking the vow, if you are clear about the necessity of taking it.
('38', 170, 1, 3, 360209) Not to take the vow is to trust ones little self.
('38', 170, 1, 4, 360259) To take it is to distrust oneself and to trust only God.
('38', 170, 1, 5, 360316) I know where I should have been if I had not taken the vows I have.
('38', 170, 1, 6, 360384) But there is the other side, i.e., Andrewss.
('38', 170, 1, 7, 360429) He says: I do not know that the voice within is always the voice of God.
('38', 170, 1, 8, 360502) What I may hold to be right today may be found to be wrong tomorrow.
('38', 170, 1, 9, 360571) I must therefore hold myself free to do the will of God as I discover it from moment to moment. This attitude has answered his purpose.
('38', 170, 1, 10, 360707) I should be undone.
('38', 170, 1, 11, 360727) I see a fallacy behind As argument.
('38', 170, 1, 12, 360763) He does not.
('38', 170, 1, 13, 360776) So it sustains him.
('38', 170, 1, 14, 360796) Fallacy, error and the like are relative terms.
('38', 170, 1, 15, 360844) What is good for one may not be good for all even though Truth is one for all time.
('38', 170, 1, 16, 360928) The difficulty lies in our hopeless ignorance of Truth.
('38', 170, 1, 17, 360984) Cruel God has enabled us to see that Truth is one and nothing else is; but He has disabled us for knowing its content.
('38', 170, 1, 18, 361103) If therefore you feel the call within to take the vow and if you feel it will make you feel freer, you shall take it.
('38', 170, 1, 19, 361221) Nothing need be done in haste.
('38', 170, 1, 20, 361252) You must keep your health.
('38', 170, 1, 21, 361279) Of course you will always starve when you feel the slightest touch of fullness or indigestion.
('38', 170, 1, 22, 361374) Even weakness is preferable to apparent strength if it is accompanied by indigestion or even a feeling of fullness.
('38', 170, 1, 23, 361490) You must not worry about your Hindi.
('38', 170, 1, 24, 361527) You are doing all you can.
('38', 170, 1, 25, 361554) The rest must lie in the hands of God.
('38', 170, 1, 26, 361593) A change may be necessary after we meet.
('38', 170, 1, 27, 361634) The fact evidently is that you must not combine two thingslearning Hindi and teaching charkha.
('38', 170, 1, 28, 361729) It evidently exhausts you.
('38', 170, 1, 29, 361756) And you have not been helped to the extent you needed.
('38', 170, 1, 30, 361811) However the experiences you have gained are inestimable and I am satisfied.
('38', 170, 1, 31, 361887) I have only now got Ramachandras letter.

('38', 171, 5, 6, 362218) SISTERS, This is the last letter I write to you, for next Monday I should be on my way back home.
('38', 171, 5, 7, 362316) In my tours I always address womens meetings.
('38', 171, 5, 8, 362362) Consequently I keep learning new things about women.
('38', 171, 5, 9, 362415) I realize that women hold the key to swaraj.
('38', 171, 5, 10, 362460) But who will awaken them?
('38', 171, 5, 11, 362486) Many women have little to do.
('38', 171, 5, 12, 362516) Who will make them industrious?
('38', 171, 5, 13, 362548) Mothers spoil their children from birth.
('38', 171, 5, 14, 362589) Who will prevent them?
('38', 171, 5, 15, 362612) They load their children with ornaments and clothes of all kinds.
('38', 171, 5, 16, 362678) They get their girls married quite young.
('38', 171, 5, 17, 362720) They give them in marriage to old men.
('38', 171, 5, 18, 362759) When I look at the jewels on women, I feel very annoyed.
('38', 171, 5, 19, 362816) Who will explain to them that real beauty lies in the heart and not in these ornaments?
('38', 171, 5, 20, 362904) I can write on many such matters.
('38', 171, 5, 21, 362938) But how can all this be set right?
('38', 171, 5, 22, 362973) It can be done only when a brilliant and dynamic Draupadi rises from amongst women.
('38', 171, 5, 23, 363057) You have to try and get the necessary qualifications.
('38', 171, 5, 24, 363111) Make up your mind about it and then have patience.
('38', 171, 5, 25, 363162) One can achieve nothing by being in too great a hurry.

('38', 171, 10, 33, 363523) We must have the minimum rituals.

('38', 172, 1, 2, 363668) Though of course you should do all that ought to be done.
('38', 172, 1, 3, 363726) Please have two copies of the [marriage] vow, one for each of them.
('38', 172, 1, 4, 363794) We shall not have to solemnize such marriages.
('38', 172, 1, 5, 363841) We cannot refuse if other friends want it.
('38', 172, 1, 6, 363884) Hence this procedure and so on.
('38', 172, 1, 7, 363916) Please think over it and try to make it as solemn and sacred as possible.
('38', 172, 1, 8, 363990) Consult Kaka; we might add to or amend it if necessary.
('38', 172, 1, 9, 364046) I think we should start the ceremony with prayers and devo tional songs and also conclude it in like manner.
('38', 172, 1, 10, 364155) Consult Kaka about this too; if we decide to do so, what bhajans we should have, what slokas we should recite in our prayers, etc.
('38', 172, 1, 11, 364286) Not the usual prayers that we offer daily but if you can find out some which would specially suit the occasion.

('38', 172, 5, 15, 364536) MANILAL, This should reach you on Wednesday.
('38', 172, 5, 16, 364581) Maganlal writes to me that you would board the train in Bom bay.
('38', 172, 5, 17, 364646) You have to leave there on Friday.
('38', 172, 5, 18, 364681) On Saturday morning I shall be in Poona.
('38', 172, 5, 19, 364722) Leaving there at 10, I shall join you at Kalyan.
('38', 172, 5, 20, 364771) I have a meeting at Poona in the morning.
('38', 172, 5, 21, 364813) Herewith letters from Nanabhai and Sushila, for your information.
('38', 172, 5, 22, 364879) I think you should honour their wish to have you at Akola for some days.
('38', 172, 5, 23, 364952) Vijayalakshmi would naturally want to know you; she is your mother in law.
('38', 172, 5, 24, 365027) You should not be angry nor should you worry over what Sushila writes about jewels and dresses; I have tried to encourage all the good traits she has cultivated.
('38', 172, 5, 25, 365189) But I have not bound her to anything.
('38', 172, 5, 26, 365227) You will influence her the way you would like to, and take such liberties as you please with her consent.
('38', 172, 5, 27, 365333) The vow to be taken at the time of the marriage ceremony is available with Panditji.
('38', 172, 5, 28, 365418) I wish you would get it in advance, think over it and understand it.
('38', 172, 5, 29, 365487) May you be always ready to observe the vow and

('38', 173, 1, 2, 365637) may God grant you the strength for it.
('38', 173, 1, 3, 365676) I know marriage begins a new life.
('38', 173, 1, 4, 365711) Therefore though I do not get the time to write to you more often or at greater length, I am always thinking about you.
('38', 173, 1, 5, 365831) Even if you stay over at Akola I must leave on Monday.
('38', 173, 1, 6, 365886) I have plenty of work waiting for me at Ashram.
('38', 173, 1, 7, 365934) Make a note of whatever you want to ask me or tell me, because after this meeting we may perhaps not meet again, may be never in our lives.
('38', 173, 1, 8, 366074) In the month of March, when you will proceed to South Africa, I do not know where I may be wandering.
('38', 173, 1, 9, 366176) I see therefore that whatever you have to ask should be done mainly on the train.
('38', 173, 1, 10, 366258) On Sunday we shall be busy with the wedding ceremony.
('38', 173, 1, 11, 366312) Of course there may not be much fuss.
('38', 173, 1, 12, 366350) There would be a solemn atmosphere on the day and also peace all round.
('38', 173, 1, 13, 366422) But I am a busy man and it is quite likely that we shall get little time to ourselves.
('38', 173, 1, 14, 366509) In his letter Nanabhai asks for Panditji to go there a day in advance.
('38', 173, 1, 15, 366580) Panditji may do so if he can.
('38', 173, 1, 16, 366610) Just the same I am dropping a line to Nanabhai assuring him that this should not be necessary.
('38', 173, 1, 17, 366705) He [Panditji] should however spare a day if possible.
('38', 173, 1, 18, 366759) Bring with you two copies of the Gita, two of the [Ashram] Bhajanavali and a couple of taklis.

('38', 173, 5, 23, 367041) You may not need Panditji to go there in advance.
('38', 173, 5, 24, 367091) All the same I have written to him that he should reach a day earlier if he could.
('38', 173, 5, 25, 367174) You must not put up any kind of elaborate decorations or other fanfare.
('38', 173, 5, 26, 367246) Please spend as little as possible on pandals, etc.
('38', 173, 5, 27, 367298) It would look well to have the marriage ceremony in the open; it would be enough if there is shade.

('38', 174, 2, 4, 367704) If he does it might become necessary to let them have a separate room.

('38', 174, 5, 8, 368003) SUSHILA, So at long last I have a letter from you written with much nervousness.
('38', 174, 5, 9, 368084) I wish you could get into the practice of writing to me without shrinking.
('38', 174, 5, 10, 368159) On Sunday Manilal and you, Nanabhai and Vijayalakshmi, myself and Ba will have to observe fast till the marriage ceremony is over, i.e., up to about 12 noon.
('38', 174, 5, 11, 368317) Devote all that time to contemplating on dharma and to understanding the significance of marriage.
('38', 174, 5, 12, 368416) People are now totally oblivious of the fact that marriage is not a license, it is a discipline.
('38', 174, 5, 13, 368513) A personman or womanhas recourse to marriage to regulate, to circumscribe the desire one feels.
('38', 174, 5, 14, 368609) This is the distinction between man and beast.
('38', 174, 5, 15, 368656) Thus though pursuit of pleasure results from marriage, the Shastras suggest that the couple should gradually shake off its hold over them.
('38', 174, 5, 16, 368795) Even those relationships which are formed for pleasure, the Shastras try to use for the attainment of moksha.
('38', 174, 5, 17, 368905) They enjoin them to this end.
('38', 174, 5, 18, 368935) So much so that seekers have described the relationship between the individual self and the Supreme Self on the analogy of marital union.
('38', 174, 5, 19, 369073) The concept of purity underlies conjugal love just as much as the communion of an individual with God.
('38', 174, 5, 20, 369176) Thus marriage can become a great help in rendering social service.
('38', 174, 5, 21, 369243) May your marriage prove so.

('38', 175, 8, 14, 370391) I do not think there has been any follower of Lokamanya who has tried to carry out the mantra more than I. There may be many whose efforts are equal to mine, but no one can claim to have put forth greater effort.
('38', 175, 8, 15, 370604) For I know that not only is swaraj our birthright, but that it is our sacred duty to win it.
('38', 175, 8, 16, 370697) For in so far as we are removed from swaraj we are removed from manhood.
('38', 175, 8, 17, 370770) A proper manifestation of all our powers is impossible without swaraj.
('38', 175, 8, 18, 370841) And the swaraj that Lokamanya had in view was not the swaraj for Ratnagiri people or for Maharashtrians, but for the whole of India, poor as well as rich, and swaraj has no meaning for

('38', 176, 1, 3, 371274) Why should we not serve our mills, you ask.
('38', 176, 1, 4, 371318) Sheth Narottam Morarji, the owner of the Sholapur mills is a friend of mine, and I was the guest of his son 1 who showered his affection on me.
('38', 176, 1, 5, 371462) But does that mean that I must use cloth from the Sholapur mills and serve that poor Sheth Narottam and his son?
('38', 176, 1, 6, 371575) Even they will not say that I would be serving the poor by using their cloth.
('38', 176, 1, 7, 371653) I have been told everywhere that Konkan is poor.
('38', 176, 1, 8, 371702) If you are poor, the situation must be unbearable for you.
('38', 176, 1, 9, 371761) You say that poor people from your parts go to Bombay and earn a living there.
('38', 176, 1, 10, 371840) Do you know the price that they have to pay for that living?
('38', 176, 1, 11, 371901) They live in hovels without light and air, a few feet by a few feet, where several men and women are huddled together without regard for their bodily cleanliness or decency.
('38', 176, 1, 12, 372075) Are you ready to send your mothers and sisters to live under such conditions?
('38', 176, 1, 13, 372153) Do you not agree that the women that go to the Bombay mills are your mothers and sisters and the men your brothers?
('38', 176, 1, 14, 372269) Are you prepared to see your brothers and sisters take to a life of drunkenness and shame and return home and spread the infection of their vices?
('38', 176, 1, 15, 372416) Is it worth while paying this terrible price for the eight annas they manage to earn there?
('38', 176, 2, 16, 372508) Our cattle are destroyed because we do not know true cow protection and our villages are ruined because we do not know true economics and sociology.
('38', 176, 2, 17, 372657) The charkha can stop that ruinous process.
('38', 176, 2, 18, 372700) Do you know the daily income per head of our country?
('38', 176, 2, 19, 372754) Our economists say that it is one anna and six pies, though even that is misleading.
('38', 176, 2, 20, 372839) If someone were to work out the average depth of a river as four feet from the fact that the river was six feet deep in certain places and two feet in others, and proceeded to ford it, would he not be drowned?
('38', 176, 2, 21, 373049) That is how statistics mislead.
('38', 176, 2, 22, 373081) The average income is worked out from the figures of the income of the poor man as also of the Viceroy and the millionaires.
('38', 176, 2, 23, 373206) The actual income will therefore be hardly three pice per head.
('38', 176, 2, 24, 373270) Now if I supplement that income by even three pice with the help of the charkha, am I not right in calling the charkha my cow of plenty?
('38', 176, 2, 25, 373407) Some people attribute superhuman powers to me, some say I have an extraordinary character.
('38', 176, 2, 26, 373498) God alone knows what I am.
('38', 176, 2, 27, 373525) It is also possible to disagree about the efficacy of

('38', 177, 1, 2, 373676) satyagraha, but I do not think there is any reason for disagreement on these obvious facts about the charkha.
('38', 177, 1, 3, 373786) If someone convinces me today that there is no poverty in India, that there are few in India who starve for want of even a few pice a day, I shall own myself to have been mistaken and shall destroy the spinning wheel.
('38', 177, 1, 4, 374004) I ask you therefore to bear in mind what you mean when you say that Konkan is poor.
('38', 177, 1, 5, 374088) If you are really poor there is nothing like the wheel which can cure your impoverishment and which is a safeguard for the honour of your women.
('38', 177, 1, 6, 374233) Seek ye first the charkha and its concomitants and everything else will be added unto you.
('38', 177, 1, 7, 374324) How can you disregard a thing which is of such a national and universal character?
('38', 177, 1, 8, 374407) Does it behove the followers of Lokamanya to deride or reject the wheel?
('38', 177, 1, 9, 374480) But you will ask, as a youth who sought to heckle me asked, If Lokamanya liked this thing, why did he not ask the country to take it up? Well, I cannot be taken in by your question.
('38', 177, 1, 10, 374662) Whether or not Lokamanya had khadi in mind when he defined swadeshi, surely his swadeshi cannot but include khadi.
('38', 177, 1, 11, 374777) I am but the heir of Lokamanya, and if I do not add to the patrimony he has left me, I would not be a worthy son of a worthy father.
('38', 177, 1, 12, 374910) I pondered well over Lokamanyas message, applied my many years experience to it and came to the conclusion that Lokamanyas message must mean khadi.
('38', 177, 1, 13, 375058) Do you know what he used to do?
('38', 177, 1, 14, 375090) I am telling you of an incident that happened a short time before his death.
('38', 177, 1, 15, 375167) When Maulana Shaukat Ali approached him as regards the Khilafat question, Lokamanya said to him: I shall put my signature to whatever Gandhi signs, for I trust to his better knowledge in this matter. Supposing therefore Lokamanya had not khadi in mind when he advised swadeshi, what does it matter?
('38', 177, 1, 16, 375466) Supposing we were manufacturing spectacles here and someone were to say, We cannot use them, Lokamanya did not advise the use thereof, would it be proper?
('38', 177, 1, 17, 375621) We would dismiss him as a literalist, Vedavadarata as the Gita would describe him.
('38', 177, 1, 18, 375704) As the literalist interpreter of the Vedas does not grasp the infinite meaning of the Vedas, even so these literalist interpreters of Lokamanyas message miss its infinite power.
('38', 177, 1, 19, 375882) But someone comes and says, When Mussalmans are conver ting us who is going to listen to your khadi? Have you, I ask, become so impotent that you will be Mussalmans because someone compels you to embrace Islam?
('38', 177, 1, 20, 376093) If you have true dharma in you, no

('38', 178, 1, 2, 376171) one dare violate it.
('38', 178, 1, 3, 376192) But I want to protect even our dharma by means of khadi.
('38', 178, 1, 4, 376249) For khadi means the service not only of Hindu but of Mussalman women.
('38', 178, 1, 5, 376319) A Maulvi in Bengal went and asked some of those women not to spin, on the ground that the khadi movement was a Hindu movement.
('38', 178, 1, 6, 376446) They listened to him for a couple of days, but the third day they came asking for cotton.
('38', 178, 1, 7, 376536) For what could they do?
('38', 178, 1, 8, 376560) They could not go on starving and the Maulvi had no food to offer them.
('38', 178, 1, 9, 376632) The learned author of the Mahabharata has described Vishvamitra, the sage, as ready to eat what was forbidden to him and even to steal, when he was oppressed by the pangs of hunger.
('38', 178, 1, 10, 376814) One cannot say what a hungry man or woman would not stoop to.
('38', 178, 1, 11, 376876) I therefore tell you that you must take to khadi if only to alleviate the poverty and safeguard the honour of your women.
('38', 178, 1, 12, 376998) I am asked to take part in the shuddhi movement.
('38', 178, 1, 13, 377047) How can I, when I wish that its Muslim and Christian counterparts should also cease?
('38', 178, 1, 14, 377132) It is unthinkable that a man will become good or attain salvation only if he embraces a particular religionHinduism, Chris tianity or Islam.
('38', 178, 1, 15, 377273) Purity of character and salvation depend on the purity of heart.
('38', 178, 1, 16, 377338) I therefore say to the Hindus, Do whatever you like, but dont ask a man like me, who has come to his conclusions after the maturest thinking, to take up what he cannot. Mans capacity is after all limited.
('38', 178, 1, 17, 377543) I can do what is within my power, not what is beyond it.
('38', 178, 1, 18, 377600) I cannot do a hundred or even half a dozen things at a time.
('38', 178, 1, 19, 377661) I would think myself blessed even if I can do one thing well at a time.
('38', 178, 1, 20, 377733) If you agree with me that the charkha is the best sangathan that is possible, give me as much help as you can render.

('38', 178, 4, 24, 377926) Savarkar asked Gandhiji to clear his attitude about untouchability and shuddhi.
('38', 178, 4, 25, 378006) Gandhiji cleared some of the misrepresentations and said: We cannot have long talk today, but you know my regard for you as a lover of truth and as one who would lay down his life for the sake of truth.
('38', 178, 4, 26, 378209) Besides, our goal is ultimately one and I would like you

('38', 179, 4, 8, 378836) There seems to be much force in Mr. Madons reasoning.
('38', 179, 4, 9, 378890) I send you a copy of my letter to Mr. Madon.
('38', 179, 4, 10, 378935) I shall anxiously await your reply.

('38', 180, 2, 3, 379718) After having advertised the Ramachandra Lift in these pages I have been purposely silent about it all these weeks because it was necessary to ensure a continuous supply of these lifts on the cheapest terms possible before further notice could be taken of this ingenious invention.
('38', 180, 2, 4, 379999) I have much pleasure now in informing the reader that Sjt.
('38', 180, 2, 5, 380058) Ramachandra Aiyer has placed himself entirely at the disposal of the Ashram, made over his patent rights to the Ashram subject to a certain royalty being paid to him for every lift up to 1,000 lifts.
('38', 180, 2, 6, 380258) Lifts can now be had on the following terms:
('38', 180, 3, 7, 380303) Cost of the lift f.o.r.
('38', 180, 3, 8, 380327) Sabarmati: For 30 ft.
('38', 180, 3, 9, 380349) depth, Rs. 125; for 35 ft.
('38', 180, 3, 10, 380376) depth, Rs. 132; for 40 ft.
('38', 180, 3, 11, 380403) depth, Rs. 139 and so on; Rs. 7 extra for every additional 5 ft.
('38', 180, 3, 12, 380468) These quotations are for such lifts as contain buckets up to 32 gallons.
('38', 180, 3, 13, 380541) For buckets of greater sizes special quotations will be offered.
('38', 180, 3, 14, 380606) (Prices are subject to market fluctuations and may vary without notice.) For local governments, zamindars, native States and co operative societies who are willing to introduce the lift in their jurisdictions on a large scale) special quotations will be supplied on application for orders of 50 lifts or over at a time.
('38', 180, 3, 15, 380926) A reduction in the prices will be made according to saving in the charges for packing, despatching, etc.
('38', 180, 3, 16, 381031) When sending orders, the intending purchaser should supply the maximum depth of the well as measured from the silt to the point of discharge, and mention the size of bucket required.
('38', 180, 3, 17, 381214) All orders must accompany 50 per cent cash and for the balance, the articles will be sent per V.P.P. The delivery of the lift will be made nearly a month after the receipt of money in order of precedence.
('38', 180, 3, 18, 381419) There is no profit made by the Ashram, only cost price up to delivery is charged.
('38', 180, 3, 19, 381501) The lift that has been now at work at the Ashram has proved entirely satisfactory and the problem at the Ashram is what use to make of the superfluous bulls.
('38', 180, 3, 20, 381659) An illustrative catalogue giving full details has been printed.
('38', 180, 3, 21, 381723) Anyone requiring further information can have the catalogue on sending to the Ashram Manager one anna postage stamp.
('38', 180, 3, 22, 381840) All those who corresponded with Sjt.
('38', 180, 3, 23, 381877) Ramachandra Aiyer or with me may now have their lifts on complying with the foregoing terms.

('38', 181, 1, 2, 382034) 162. IS INDIA PROHIBITIONIST?
('38', 181, 2, 3, 382064) An English friend who is anxious to undertake prohibition work for India writes: 1
('38', 181, 3, 4, 382147) I know that what everyone will say to me is that the Indians themselves have shown no overpowering desire for prohibition and that as they have not organized any movement for this, it is interference on our part to
('38', 181, 4, 5, 382362) move in the matter.
('38', 181, 4, 6, 382382) Moreover of all the Councils only one or two have declared for prohibition.
('38', 181, 4, 7, 382458) Already people are saying this to me.
('38', 181, 4, 8, 382496) I always point them to the Non co operation movement when the volunteers picketed the liquor shops.
('38', 181, 4, 9, 382596) But when they say that was five years ago and they have shown no great enthusiasm lately, what is the answer?
('38', 181, 4, 10, 382706) The puzzle the friend asks me to solve is not new.
('38', 181, 4, 11, 382757) The question is bound to occur to one who does not know the history of the total prohibition movement in India.
('38', 181, 4, 12, 382869) And a stranger coming in our midst is bound to ask himself, If India wants total prohibition, why does she not agitate for it as she does for many other things? One observes that people do not agitate when they feel absolutely helpless.
('38', 181, 4, 13, 383106) It is our helplessness which prevents us from agitating beyond having reso lutions by temperance societies and sometimes petitions to the Legislative bodies.
('38', 181, 4, 14, 383264) The cry for swaraj came out of a realization of growing helplessness in matters of paramount importance to our well being.
('38', 181, 4, 15, 383387) Take the military expenditure.
('38', 181, 4, 16, 383418) Everyone recognizes that much of it is a criminal waste of money collected from the starving millions.
('38', 181, 4, 17, 383521) Instead of agitating for reduction in military expenditure, we agitate for swaraj, the argument being that nothing is possible without swaraj.
('38', 181, 4, 18, 383664) Who can say that there is no great deal of truth in the argument?
('38', 181, 4, 19, 383730) When in 1920 we felt that we were getting swaraj, we took the law into our own hands, we successfully picketed the liquor shops and the Government was frightened to notice an immediate fall in the liquor revenue.
('38', 181, 4, 20, 383943) Liquor dealers trembled in their shoes and for a moment it appeared as if the drink evil had gone.
('38', 181, 4, 21, 384042) Unfortunately the party of non violence had not attained sufficient control over the people.
('38', 181, 4, 22, 384135) Violence broke out.
('38', 181, 4, 23, 384155) It was discovered that pickets did not everywhere carry out the instructions to create a blockade without resort to violence or threats to use it.
('38', 181, 4, 24, 384302) The picketing had therefore to
('38', 181, 5, 25, 384333) 1 The reference is to Muriel Lester; vide Letter to Muriel Lester, 17 3 1927.
('38', 182, 0, 1, 384411) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 183
('38', 182, 1, 2, 384454) be suspended.
('38', 182, 1, 3, 384468) But the history of 1920 21 shows in unmistakable terms what India would do if she had the power and what she did do when she thought that she had it.
('38', 182, 1, 4, 384618) Let it be further borne in mind that millions of Indians are teetotallers by religion and by habit.
('38', 182, 1, 5, 384718) Millions therefore cannot possibly be interested in keeping up the nefarious liquor traffic.
('38', 182, 1, 6, 384811) Thus in so far as it can be said that there is no agitation in India in favour of total prohibition, absence of agitation is due not to want of desire on the part of the people to secure total prohibition, but it is due to a consciousness of helplessness and to the certain know ledge that it is an integral part of the struggle for swaraj.
('38', 182, 1, 7, 385152) The very fact that it is necessary for any Englishman to defend liquor revenue on the grounds that there is no agitation among us for total prohibition, makes out an irresistible case for swaraj.
('38', 182, 1, 8, 385348) For, it shows utter ignorance of Indian conditions where the opinion is honestly held.
('38', 182, 1, 9, 385435) There is no agitation on the part of the people against malaria and scores of other diseases.
('38', 182, 1, 10, 385529) Is that any reason for taking no measures for eradicating malaria and other diseases?
('38', 182, 1, 11, 385615) In order to deal with a known evil, no agitation should be necessary for taking prompt measures.
('38', 182, 1, 12, 385712) The drink and the drug evil is in many respects infinitely worse than the evil caused by malaria and the like; for, whilst the latter only injures the body, the former saps both body and soul.
('38', 182, 1, 13, 385905) The drink revenue, military expenditure and the Lancashires exploitation of India through its calico, constitute the threefold wrong done by British rule to India.
('38', 182, 1, 14, 386069) When Englishmen realize that it is sinful to trade upon the drink habit of the poor labourers of India, that it is sinful to dump down English and other foreign calico on the Indian soil when Indias starving millions can easily produce during their spare hours all the cloth needed for her requirements, and when they realize that it is sinful to impose a terrific military burden upon India under the ostensible purpose of defending her borders but in reality for the sake of holding her people under subjection against their will, it would be a complete demonstration of change of heart, and co operation on a basis of absolute equality will become a real possibility.
('38', 182, 1, 15, 386740) The only agitation therefore that India can carry on is to end the system which makes these wrongs possible, which is the same thing as saying that
('38', 183, 0, 1, 386888) 184 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 183, 1, 2, 386930) the agitation for swaraj is the agitation for the removal of these wrongs.
('38', 183, 1, 3, 387005) This removal is the acid test, in my opinion, of English sincerity.

('38', 183, 3, 6, 387115) Here is wisdom sent to me by the friend whom I have already introduced to the readers of these columns:
('38', 183, 4, 7, 387219) That which is incomplete becomes complete.
('38', 183, 4, 8, 387262) The crooked becomes straight.
('38', 183, 4, 9, 387292) The empty becomes full.
('38', 183, 4, 10, 387316) The worn out becomes new.
('38', 183, 4, 11, 387342) He who obtains has little.
('38', 183, 4, 12, 387369) He who scatters has much.
('38', 183, 4, 13, 387395) That is why the self controlled man holds to unity and brings it into manifestation for men.
('38', 183, 4, 14, 387488) He looks not at self, therefore he sees clearly.
('38', 183, 4, 15, 387537) He asserts not himself, therefore he shines.
('38', 183, 4, 16, 387582) He boasts not himself, therefore he has merit.
('38', 183, 4, 17, 387629) He glorifies not himself, therefore he endures.
('38', 183, 4, 18, 387677) The Master indeed does not strive, yet no one in the world can strive against him.
('38', 183, 4, 19, 387760) The words of the Ancients were not empty words.
('38', 183, 4, 20, 387808) That which is incomplete becomes complete.

('38', 183, 7, 23, 387906) K. A. Nair writes as follows: 1
('38', 183, 8, 24, 387938) I commend this ingenious device for the adoption of khadi lovers.
('38', 183, 8, 25, 388004) This method enables one to buy khadi without having to pay for it at once.
('38', 183, 8, 26, 388079) But the unfortunate member of this co operative club, as it may be called, whose name comes last in the raffle gains no
('38', 183, 9, 27, 388199) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('38', 183, 9, 28, 388236) The correspondent, a member of the All India Spinners Association had organized a raffle, with 12 members, each paying Rs. 2, monthly, for twelve months, all agreeing that the winner each month will be given khadi cloth worth Rs. 24 according to his taste from a Khadi Bhandar instead of Rs. 24 in cash.
('38', 184, 0, 1, 388540) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 185
('38', 184, 1, 2, 388583) advantage from his investment save that he will have learnt the art of buying khadi in a thrifty manner.
('38', 184, 1, 3, 388688) The club will be his savings bank and at the end of a year he is in a position to buy all his khadi worth Rs. 24 without feeling the pinch.
('38', 184, 1, 4, 388828) If the arrangement can be extended to a longer period, as it well may be by easy adjustment, all can receive the same advantage.
('38', 184, 1, 5, 388957) But perhaps the attraction lies in the uncertainty of advantage and in the trifling nature of the disadvan tage.
('38', 184, 1, 6, 389070) The success of this scheme lies entirely in the honesty of the members.
('38', 184, 1, 7, 389142) For, if the member who has received his Rs. 24 worth of khadi ceases to pay his contributions, the remaining ones become the losers.
('38', 184, 1, 8, 389275) Therefore if this scheme has to work inexpensively and yet effectively, the membership must be necessarily restricted and con fined only to those who know one another and are also perhaps working in a common institution or office so as to minimize the risk of loss by death or dishonesty.
('38', 184, 1, 9, 389564) I hope that the example set by Sjt.

('38', 184, 5, 14, 389732) I had come entirely unprepared for these tokens of love, 3 love not only for me, but for the poor, and my greatest joy is due to the shape these tokens have taken.
('38', 184, 5, 15, 389896) The donation of Rs. 63 3 0 4 reminds me of a sacred donation that I received from the late Swami Shraddhanand for my work in South Africa and which represented the value of the labour of love rendered by his brahmacharis.
('38', 184, 5, 16, 390118) It is worth more than millions to me and it makes my responsibility for utilizing the funds all the greater.
('38', 184, 5, 17, 390227) Your yarn also is worth its weight in gold, for what is the value of gold, but the price of labour spent in obtaining it?

('38', 185, 2, 4, 391056) With brahmacharya as your shield and buckler you should find no difficulty in entering any walk of life, and if you will follow the vocation natural to youagriculture, cow protection, and commercein the right way, you will serve both your community and the country.
('38', 185, 2, 5, 391322) But beware that your pursuit of these professions may not become synonymous with exploitation as it is today.
('38', 185, 2, 6, 391432) If you desire to take off the sinister aspect of greedy commerce, you will have to make it centre round the charkha.
('38', 185, 2, 7, 391549) There are exploiters enough on this earth.
('38', 185, 2, 8, 391592) If we also follow suit, we shall have to seek for our victims on other planets.
('38', 185, 2, 9, 391672) Khadi is the only wholesome national trade that we can pursue and as Vaisyas I ask you not to neglect it.
('38', 185, 3, 10, 391778) There were garlands .
('38', 185, 3, 11, 391800) but Gandhiji did not auction them.
('38', 185, 3, 12, 391835) Nor did he make any appeal for collections.
('38', 185, 3, 13, 391879) He said: I had not come on a business visit here.

('38', 186, 3, 4, 392749) In the morning Gandhiji performed the installation ceremony of the image of Maruti 2 as part of their gymnasium.
('38', 186, 3, 5, 392862) He said: I install this image of Maruti here, not merely because Maruti had the strength of a giant.
('38', 186, 3, 6, 392963) Even Ravana had that strength.
('38', 186, 3, 7, 392994) But Maruti had the strength of soul, and his physical strength was only a manifestation of his spiritual strength which in its turn was the direct fruit of his exclusive devotion to Rama and his brahmacharya.
('38', 186, 3, 8, 393203) May you therefore be like Maruti of matchless valour born out of your brahmacharya and may that valour be dedicated to the service of the Motherland.

('38', 186, 5, 11, 393401) [March 4, 1927] 4
('38', 186, 6, 12, 393419) [Concluding his Maharashtra tour Gandhiji addressed a public meeting at Reay Market.
('38', 186, 6, 13, 393504) He said:] Hanuman tore open his heart and showed that there was nothing there but Ramanama.
('38', 186, 6, 14, 393596) I have none of the power of Hanuman to tear open my heart, but if any of you feel inclined to do it, I assure you will find nothing here but love for Rama whom I see face to face in the starving millions of India.
('38', 186, 7, 15, 393810) Gandhiji .
('38', 186, 7, 16, 393821) [addressed a students meeting] at about midnight.
('38', 186, 7, 17, 393871) The cry for English, English was there .
('38', 186, 7, 18, 393912) Gandhiji, pained as he was by it, acceeded to the demand because of his overflowing love for the students.
('38', 186, 7, 19, 394019) He said: If I cannot make myself understood to Poona students, it is my misfortune, the misfortune of my country, and shall I say your misfortune?
('38', 186, 8, 20, 394166) But he acceeded to the students clamour for English only so far as he had to express his regret for being late at the meeting .

('38', 187, 1, 2, 394507) in gaining their ear, he delivered the message itself in Hindi.
('38', 187, 1, 3, 394571) He said: It is possible that my message if delivered in English might get more silver from you, and it is probable that you might understand me better.
('38', 187, 1, 4, 394723) But I hold my message to be far superior to myself and far superior to the vehicle through which it is expressed.
('38', 187, 1, 5, 394837) It has a power all its own, and I hope it will produce an impression on the youth of India.
('38', 187, 1, 6, 394929) Whether it will produce an impression in my lifetime or not, I do not care, but my faith is immovable, and as the days roll on and as the agony of the masses becomes prolonged, it will burn itself into the heart of every Indian who has a heart to respond to the message.
('38', 187, 1, 7, 395200) You must understand, that at a time of my life when I should be enjoying my well earned rest, I am not going about from one end of the country to the other for nothing.
('38', 187, 1, 8, 395369) It is because I feel within myself with increasing force every day the strength of my conviction that I must try until the end of my days to reach it to as many ears and hearts as possible.
('38', 187, 2, 9, 395559) The rest was a brief history of the charkha movement, which he had conceived as early as 1908 before he had actually seen a charkha, and the duty of the student world to those at the cost of whose moral and material ruin they were receiving their education.
('38', 187, 2, 10, 395817) You may, if you will, go on receiving that education, but do at least make a decent return for it.
('38', 187, 2, 11, 395916) I know you have not taken to khadi, not because you are perverse, but because you lack the conviction that there is anything like the stupendous problem of poverty and unemployment, whose existence I have been declaring from the housetops.
('38', 187, 2, 12, 396156) The King of Siam refused to believe Lord Curzon when he said to him that he was coming from a country where rivers were frozen for a part of the year.
('38', 187, 2, 13, 396307) I assure you I am describing to you con ditions I have seen with my own eyes when I say that 30 million people in our land have to go without a decent meal a day.
('38', 187, 3, 14, 396470) The rest of the speech was on brahmacharya, a thing that comes uppermost to Gandhijis lips whenever he finds himself amongst students.
('38', 187, 3, 15, 396605) Rubbing the thing home into them, he said: It is as easy as it appears to be difficult, for brahmacharya is a quality of the soul; and your souls are not dead but slumbering.
('38', 187, 3, 16, 396780) They are only waiting to be aroused.
('38', 187, 3, 17, 396817) It seems difficult to arouse them because we have become unbelievers.
('38', 187, 3, 18, 396887) It will be easy as soon as you have faith, for with faith comes Gods grace.

('38', 188, 4, 7, 397220) DEAR SATIS BABU, I have come to Akola for a day to marry Manilal to a niece of Kishorelal Mashruwala.
('38', 188, 4, 8, 397322) I leave for the Ashram tonight.
('38', 188, 4, 9, 397354) I hope you are making steady progress.
('38', 188, 4, 10, 397393) Arrangements are being made to send you as much as possible out of the 50,000 you ask.
('38', 188, 4, 11, 397480) The hawking commission is not possible.
('38', 188, 4, 12, 397520) It is paid under the rules only to professional hawkers for their maintenance.
('38', 188, 4, 13, 397599) If we stretch the rule, we should be overwhelmed.
('38', 188, 4, 14, 397649) The rules were framed to encourage hawking for a livelihood.
('38', 188, 4, 15, 397710) I do hope that you are all now past the danger zone.
('38', 188, 4, 16, 397763) How is Tarini?

('38', 188, 8, 23, 398131) This is early morning.
('38', 188, 8, 24, 398154) I am sitting in a third class carriage at Bhusaval with Ba, Sushila, Manilals wife, Manilal, Ramdas, Mahadev and Panditji who came to perform the marriage ceremony.

('38', 189, 1, 3, 398491) To gain one more day, I decided to travel during my silence.
('38', 189, 1, 4, 398552) I am travelling third class because I must not spend on second class for Manilal and his wife and I do not want to cut myself off from the new addition the very first day of her joining the family.
('38', 189, 1, 5, 398750) And as I have about six days of rest at the Ashram in front of me, and as this is an easy third class journey, I do not mind it; on the contrary I like it.
('38', 189, 2, 6, 398906) I shall read your corrections in the autobiography when I reach the Ashram.
('38', 189, 2, 7, 398982) I had anticipated your many corrections in the chapters that had not been previously seen by you.

('38', 189, 8, 14, 399274) Every day I think of writing to you, but where could I get the time?
('38', 189, 8, 15, 399343) Now Navajivan is as good as a letter from me to everyone; you have to be content with it.
('38', 189, 8, 16, 399433) This too I write on a train, on my way to the Ashram.
('38', 189, 8, 17, 399487) I agree you had to go to Rajkot though I did not like your running away.
('38', 189, 8, 18, 399560) It would have been much better if you could have stayed on at the Ashram.
('38', 189, 8, 19, 399634) Now let me know what you do there about your studies, etc.

('38', 190, 5, 14, 400914) Go and sit near Sushila.
('38', 190, 5, 15, 400939) See what clothes she has got, find out her wishes and then make a note of what she needs.

('38', 190, 8, 22, 401267) I gladly publish Suhasini Devis letter 3 which the reader will find in another column.
('38', 190, 8, 23, 401354) Whilst the versatile President 4 of the Congress is well able to defend himself, I am inclined to think that my fair correspondent has over generalized from her own very brief experience.
('38', 190, 8, 24, 401542) No statistics are needed to demonstrate the vast strides that the movement for the removal of untouchability has made.
('38', 190, 8, 25, 401661) The barrier is breaking down everywhere.
('38', 190, 8, 26, 401702) The higher classes are to be met
('38', 190, 9, 27, 401735) 1 Evidently written soon after Manilals marriage 2 As in the source 3 In this she had complained that concrete action regarding removal of untouchability was not being taken to the extent it was demanded in the Congress resolutions.

('38', 191, 1, 3, 402182) It was this phenomenon that the President evidently had in mind when he made the reference in his address.
('38', 191, 1, 4, 402289) There is however infinitely more yet to be done than has been already accomplished.
('38', 191, 1, 5, 402373) The question of breaking down the feminine prejudice is most difficult.
('38', 191, 1, 6, 402445) It is in reality a question of female education.
('38', 191, 1, 7, 402494) And in this it is a question not merely of education of girls but it is one of the education of married women.
('38', 191, 1, 8, 402605) I have therefore repeatedly suggested that every patriotic husband should become the wifes own teacher and prepare her for work among her less fortunate sisters.
('38', 191, 1, 9, 402767) I have also drawn attention to the implications of the suggestion.
('38', 191, 1, 10, 402834) One of them is for husbands to cease to treat their wives as objects of their enjoyment but to regard them as co partners in their work of nation building.
('38', 191, 1, 11, 402990) We cannot have Rama without Sita.
('38', 191, 1, 12, 403024) And Sita got her real schooling under the gentle care of her partner during those terrible years of exile and probation.
('38', 191, 1, 13, 403145) Well, we are all exiles in our own land and need to imitate Rama and Sita to the best of our abilities and opportunity.
('38', 191, 1, 14, 403265) And in this connection, I cannot help drawing Suhasini Devis attention to the fact that Sjt.
('38', 191, 1, 15, 403358) Iyengar has not only broken down the barrier of untou chability for himself but has carried his wife and family too with him in the reform which perhaps he himself would have thought impossi ble only ten years ago.
('38', 191, 1, 16, 403573) The question of inter dining must be kept distinct from that of untouchability.
('38', 191, 1, 17, 403653) Exclusion in culinary matters permeates the whole of Hindu society.
('38', 191, 1, 18, 403721) To confuse it with untouchability is to retard the progress of the latter movement which is aimed at removing the ban on the social service to which the so called untouchable has as much right as any other human being and on the same terms as the others receive it.
('38', 191, 1, 19, 403987) There is, too, confusion regarding swaraj.
('38', 191, 1, 20, 404030) The term swaraj has many meanings.
('38', 191, 1, 21, 404065) When Sjt.
('38', 191, 1, 22, 404075) Iyengar says that removal of untouchability has nothing to do with swaraj, I presume he means that its existence can be no hindrance to constitutional advance.
('38', 191, 1, 23, 404235) It can surely have nothing to do with diarchy or greater and effective powers being given to the legislatures.
('38', 191, 1, 24, 404346) Removal of untouchability is a social question to be handled by Hindus.
('38', 191, 1, 25, 404418) Why should it prevent the Mussalman and the Parsi in common with the Hindu from having the power to regulate the military expenditure, to determine the ratio or to achieve total prohi bition or to impose a prohibitive tariff on foreign

('38', 192, 1, 3, 404745) Real organic swaraj is a different question.
('38', 192, 1, 4, 404790) That freedom which is associated with the term swaraj in the popular mind is no doubt unattainable without not only the removal of untouchability and the promotion of heart unity between the different sections but also without removing many other social evils that can be easily named.
('38', 192, 1, 5, 405076) That inward growth which must never stop we have come to understand by the comprehensive term swaraj.
('38', 192, 1, 6, 405178) And that swaraj cannot be had so long as walls of prejudice, passion and superstition continue to stifle the growth of that stately oak.

('38', 192, 4, 9, 405382) There is no province at the present moment so sorely affected as Bengal.
('38', 192, 4, 10, 405455) Some of its best young men are rotting in jails without knowing why.
('38', 192, 4, 11, 405524) Even in the Congress camp there is division.
('38', 192, 4, 12, 405569) After Deshbandhu the Provincial Congress Committee has not been able to reconcile itself to a single leadership.
('38', 192, 4, 13, 405682) It is no wonder.
('38', 192, 4, 14, 405699) There could be only one Deshbandhu.
('38', 192, 4, 15, 405735) But in spite of all this, constructive work is going on in Bengal almost without a stop.
('38', 192, 4, 16, 405824) The number of selfless young men who are engaged in that work is daily growing.
('38', 192, 4, 17, 405904) The Pravartak Sangh of Bengal whose headquarters are in Chandranagar and which is guided by Sjt.
('38', 192, 4, 18, 406001) Motilal Roy has been steadily increasing its activity in the production and sale of khadi.
('38', 192, 4, 19, 406092) But hitherto khadi in the Sangh has been a subsidiary activitya little one among big ones.
('38', 192, 4, 20, 406183) But Moti Babu is now determined to make it the centre of his system.
('38', 192, 4, 21, 406252) I had a long talk about it myself with him when he said that the conviction was being forced upon him that it was not possible to render true service to the masses except through the spinning wheel as the centre piece.
('38', 192, 4, 22, 406471) Messrs Banker and Lakshmidas visited Chandranagar after me and they gave me a glowing account of the enthusiasm of the Sangh, about the wheel and its work at Kutubdia.
('38', 192, 4, 23, 406639) They told me too how eager Moti Babu was to learn the latest improvements in carding and spinning.
('38', 192, 4, 24, 406738) The Sangh is a comparatively old institution.
('38', 192, 4, 25, 406784) Its original inspiration is derived from the recluse of Pondichery and has a number of selfless devoted workers in Bengal.
('38', 193, 0, 1, 406907) 194 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 193, 1, 2, 406949) From their khadi figures before me for January, I find that at their production centre they manufactured over Rs. 700 worth of khadi and their sales amounted to over Rs. 3,400 during that month.
('38', 193, 1, 3, 407144) If the Sangh could concentrate its energies on khadi production, it could soon rival Khadi Pratishthan and Abhoy Ashram without in any way interfering with either.
('38', 193, 1, 4, 407308) For the field for both production and sale is unlimited provided that each new organization explores and takes up a new field.
('38', 193, 1, 5, 407435) It is impossible for any single organization to cope with a mighty province like Bengal.

('38', 193, 4, 8, 407567) One hears loose talk about village organization, about work in the villages.
('38', 193, 4, 9, 407644) Paper schemes also for village organization are now and again presented to the country and sometimes elegantly printed and often indifferently written.
('38', 193, 4, 10, 407796) When questioned the authors tell us frankly that they have not tried their schemes, they have not got the resources, or the time or the inclination; but they think that any idea that occurs to them they are in duty bound to put before the country, however ill digested or impracticable it might be.
('38', 193, 4, 11, 408095) Some of the authors get angry when they find that their schemes do not even get a start.
('38', 193, 4, 12, 408184) But there is one scheme which has been now before the country for some years and which its authors have tried to work first individually, then collectively and which is now being worked through an ever growing organization called the All India Spinners Association.
('38', 193, 4, 13, 408450) The spinning programme which has been demonstrated to be comparatively a success can be indefinitely extended if workers of the right type can be had.
('38', 193, 4, 14, 408601) During the Maharashtra tour, I have been taken to villages where there is almost continuous famine and where people are supposed to be without enough work and without enough to eat.
('38', 193, 4, 15, 408783) Some of the villages are deserted for six or eight months during the year.
('38', 193, 4, 16, 408858) The villagers go to Bombay, work under unhealthy and often immoral conditions, then return to their villages during the rainy season bringing with them corruption, drunkenness and disease.
('38', 193, 4, 17, 409047) If the righttype of workers go to these villages with the message of the wheel and with a patience that will not be exhausted and a faith that will not be moved, not one of the villagers need leave their homes.
('38', 193, 4, 18, 409258) For it is not

('38', 194, 1, 2, 409315) merely the wages earned by the spinners that are to be counted but it is the whole reconstruction that follows in the wake of the spinning wheel.
('38', 194, 1, 3, 409461) The village weaver, the village dyer, the village washerman, the village blacksmith, the village carpenter, all and many others will then find themselves reinstated in their ancient dignity, as is already happ ening wherever the spinning wheel has gained a footing.
('38', 194, 1, 4, 409727) Who then can become a village worker?
('38', 194, 1, 5, 409765) For the work that is required of him each worker should have a thorough knowledge both theoretical and practical of the science of spinning; he should there fore know the different varieties of cotton; he should know the method of picking cotton suitable for hand spinning.
('38', 194, 1, 6, 410039) For mill spin ning cotton is picked anyhow.
('38', 194, 1, 7, 410083) For hand spinning if cotton is properly picked it will save an immense amount of labour and the yarn also will be stronger.
('38', 194, 1, 8, 410207) He should know how to gin and should know the varieties of hand gins used in Indian villages.
('38', 194, 1, 9, 410301) He should know carding and he should know the different carding bows in use.
('38', 194, 1, 10, 410378) He should be able to tell the different staples of cotton and should be able to spin a given number of counts.
('38', 194, 1, 11, 410489) He should be able to test the strength and evenness and counts of yarn.
('38', 194, 1, 12, 410561) He should know a good charkha from a bad one and should be able to put dilapidated charkhas under repair.
('38', 194, 1, 13, 410667) He should be able to straighten an incorrect spindle.
('38', 194, 1, 14, 410721) If the worker is to live a model life in his village, he must know also the laws of civic sanitation and provide an object lesson in sanitation to the villagers.
('38', 194, 1, 15, 410883) He should know the domestic treatment of diseases of daily occurrence.
('38', 194, 1, 16, 410954) He should know simple accountancy.
('38', 194, 1, 17, 410989) Above all he must lead a pure and chaste life, if he is to make his mark amongst the villagers and gain their confidence.
('38', 194, 1, 18, 411111) Naturally a village worker must find happiness in a simple and frugal life.
('38', 194, 1, 19, 411187) Let no one think that I have sketched what is an impossible requirement.
('38', 194, 1, 20, 411260) I have not.
('38', 194, 1, 21, 411272) The technique though it reads formidable is by no means so for a patient student.
('38', 194, 1, 22, 411354) Purity of character must be a foregone conclusion in any of this work.
('38', 194, 1, 23, 411425) And no village worker can help falling a prey to some disease or other if he does not know and observe in his own person the laws of sanitation and does not know domestic treatment of simple diseases.
('38', 194, 1, 24, 411626) The spinning organization is capable of accommodating any number of workers who can satisfy the simple test laid down above.

('38', 195, 4, 6, 412028) A correspondent whose studious habits are evidenced by his letter itself writes thus:
('38', 195, 5, 7, 412114) Some of the following may strike you as idle academic questions, but the mention of India and Burma in the letter of your correspondent, who objects to Hindustani being our inter provincial language, published in Young India of 10 2 1927, along with your reply 2 (in which however you do not refer to Burma), gives me the excuse to put you these questions which I have long been thinking of doing:
('38', 195, 6, 8, 412512) 1. Do you believe that Burma can properly be a partner with India in the future swaraj, or do you think it better that Burma should have a separate nationality ?
('38', 195, 6, 9, 412674) (As Burmese opinion itself is divided on the question, yours may guide both it and the Indian.) 2. Have you ever been to Burma in the course of your many past tours of your country?
('38', 195, 6, 10, 412856) If not, do you intend paying a visit to Burma in the future and when ?
('38', 195, 7, 11, 412927) 3. Dont you think it fit that Ceylon should be a partner with India in a future Swarajic Federation on account of their closer racial, linguistic and religious ties that exist between India and Burmaprovided of course that the Ceylonese are willing to it (and they seem very likely) ?
('38', 195, 8, 12, 413212) 4. Do you think that Hindustani has any appreciable vogue in Burma, though it has been a Congress province now for some years (since 1908?), or that Hindustani will be acceptable to the Burmese?
('38', 195, 9, 13, 413407) 5. Ditto of Ceylon and the Ceylonese.
('38', 195, 10, 14, 413445) Well, these questions coming from me who have never been to Burma or Ceylon myself and can boast of no personal connections there may surprise you, but my interest in them is that of a cosmopolitan, which I take you also to be.
('38', 195, 10, 15, 413673) I therefore hope you will answer them at your early convenience, especially as I know that many Burmese and Ceylonese as well as Indians are

('38', 195, 11, 17, 413837) The correspondent had expressed satisfaction over the settlement, but pointed out that owing to the bitter experience of the way such agreements have fared in the past one is apt to view it with the gravest suspicion. 2 Vide National Language, 10 2 1927.

('38', 196, 1, 2, 414135) greatly interested in them, and are curious to know your views I have been to Burma and know that part of the world suffici ently to enable me to answer with confidence the question put by the correspondent.
('38', 196, 1, 3, 414343) I cannot say the same thing of Ceylon, which in spite of my desire, I have not yet been able to visit.
('38', 196, 1, 4, 414446) I have no doubt in my mind that Burma cannot form part of India under swaraj.
('38', 196, 1, 5, 414524) British India is an artificial description reminding us of foreign, that is, British domination and therefore its boundary is contracted or expanded at the will of those who hold us in bondage.
('38', 196, 1, 6, 414718) Free India will be an orga nic whole and will include those only who desire to remain as its free citizens.
('38', 196, 1, 7, 414826) Therefore free India will have its geographical, ethnic and cultural limits.
('38', 196, 1, 8, 414903) A free India will therefore recognize the differences in race and culture of the Burmese, and while it will extend the hand of fellowship and help to the Burmese nation, it will recognize its right to complete independence and help it to regain and retain it in so far as it lies in Indias power.
('38', 196, 1, 9, 415200) Needless to say that therefore in my scheme there is no demand upon the Burmese to learn Hindi or Hindustani.
('38', 196, 1, 10, 415310) I expect those who are within the real Indian border to learn Hindustani because they are the children of a common land and heirs to a common culture and are bound together by various other considera tions and their provincial dialects contain so many common words.
('38', 196, 1, 11, 415576) About Ceylon I cannot speak with equal confidence.
('38', 196, 1, 12, 415627) Although we have a common culture with Ceylon and although it is predomin antly inhabited by Indians from the South, it is a separate entity.
('38', 196, 1, 13, 415769) And as I have no imperial aspirations for India of my imagination, I should be content to regard Ceylon as an absolutely independent State; but I should not hesitate to accept Ceylon as part of free India if the Islanders express their wish to be so in an unmistakable language.

('38', 197, 8, 11, 416764) I have intentionally given this heading to the article below: 1
('38', 197, 9, 12, 416828) It is anonymous, but a priest of Dheds is not a common sight.
('38', 197, 9, 13, 416890) This proud priest of the Dheds, therefore, has, under the pretext of concealing his name, told us in effect that there may be many workers for the Dheds but only Thakkar Bapa can be regarded as their priest.
('38', 197, 9, 14, 417098) The article is long, but the reader should not get tired.
('38', 197, 9, 15, 417156) If he has the slightest sympathy for the cause, he would not be able to leave it in the middle, once he has started reading it.
('38', 197, 9, 16, 417284) Love of the poor flows in every line of it.
('38', 197, 9, 17, 417328) If we let but a few drops of it moisten our hearts, our sufferings would end and so would those of the depressed classes.

('38', 198, 2, 9, 418140) I would gladly have given up a day at the Ashram if I could have altered the dates of the Conference.
('38', 198, 2, 10, 418242) But that was not to be thought of.
('38', 198, 2, 11, 418277) I have now suggested that Ba or Mahadev should open the exhibition in Hardwar unless they will have someone else.

('38', 201, 7, 10, 422244) MAGANLAL, I write this from a jungle.
('38', 201, 7, 11, 422282) I must have three hours.
('38', 201, 7, 12, 422307) I have already had three hours silence.
('38', 201, 7, 13, 422347) Go through the enclosed letter and do send him the essay on spinning in exchange for the spindle.
('38', 201, 7, 14, 422445) The spindle has arrived there; Krishnadas knows about it.
('38', 201, 7, 15, 422503) Send him a report about it.
('38', 201, 7, 16, 422531) If it is a good spindle we should have it [made] at a reasonable cost.
('38', 201, 7, 17, 422602) You should not keep the spindle if it is not perfect.
('38', 201, 7, 18, 422656) But you should point out its defects and help him.
('38', 201, 7, 19, 422707) The man seems to be all right.
('38', 201, 7, 20, 422738) Please let me know if in the first instance, I should not refer such letters to you.
('38', 201, 7, 21, 422823) I shudder to think of the load of your work.
('38', 201, 7, 22, 422868) I am therefore anxious to spare you as much work as possible.
('38', 201, 8, 23, 422930) Blessings from BAPU

('38', 201, 11, 26, 423070) KISHORELAL, I have your letter.
('38', 201, 11, 27, 423102) Bhai Kasandass 2 scheme is very good but he does not have competent women workers.
('38', 201, 11, 28, 423185) Bombay is not the field for such work.
('38', 201, 11, 29, 423224) Is it not a wonder that you are well?
('38', 201, 11, 30, 423262) How are you now?

('38', 202, 7, 9, 423677) BHAI HARIBHAU,
('38', 202, 8, 10, 423692) I have your letter.
('38', 202, 8, 11, 423712) I get news about your health regularly.
('38', 202, 8, 12, 423752) Now you have been released.
('38', 202, 8, 13, 423780) Thats good.
('38', 202, 8, 14, 423792) If you cannot recoup enough strength you had better drop your trip to Bharatpur.
('38', 202, 8, 15, 423873) Ghanshyamdasjis letter shows his candour.
('38', 202, 8, 16, 423915) It is enclosed herewith.

('38', 203, 1, 2, 424178) 190. SPEECH AT MADHI, MANDVI TALUK
('38', 203, 2, 3, 424213) March 15, 1927 Many thoughts occur to me on entering this taluk.
('38', 203, 2, 4, 424278) I forget my misery by poking fun at you, but it is a sign of my pain that I resort to that.
('38', 203, 2, 5, 424370) There was a day when not only Gujarat but the whole of India respected Surat district, and its contribution to the swaraj effort was considered to be the best, from the point of view of monetary help, silent work as soldiers and work in the field of education and for the service of Antyajas.
('38', 203, 2, 6, 424663) There was a friendly competition between two districts.
('38', 203, 2, 7, 424719) Even now I have memories of that friendly strife in which Bardoli had excelled itself, What a contrast between that day when Bardoli had become famous in the world, and today?
('38', 203, 2, 8, 424895) If we go to Bardoli today, we would see only a few white caps and a few Antyajas.
('38', 203, 2, 9, 424977) We would be reminded of the tragic events in Sarbhan and wonder if we would ever get swaraj.
('38', 203, 2, 10, 425070) And how can I ever forget the pledge we had taken, the oath the forty eight men had taken with God as their witness and, relying on their word, the ultimatum I had sent to the Viceroy?
('38', 203, 2, 11, 425255) And now I have to come here to inaugurate this Ashram, The lesson we should draw from this is that we should not lose heart, should not lose faith till death and should not retreatthat is the significance of the starting of this Ashram.
('38', 203, 2, 12, 425492) It is not a matter of pride that we have started it with money from the Gujarat Provincial Committee.
('38', 203, 2, 13, 425594) If you wish that an Ashram should be established here, then you should not be reluctant to give the necessary money.
('38', 203, 2, 14, 425711) You should raise the money and then ask me for men.
('38', 203, 2, 15, 425763) It is a wrong procedure to get money from the Provincial Committee for work here.
('38', 203, 2, 16, 425845) Anyone who depends only on the blood in his brain for his work is bound to fail.
('38', 203, 2, 17, 425926) One should rely on the blood in every part of ones body.
('38', 203, 2, 18, 425983) Instead of functioning as our brain, the Provincial Committee has become our feet, and we let ourselves be dragged behind it.
('38', 203, 2, 19, 426109) This is an unhappy state of affairs.
('38', 203, 2, 20, 426146) When I see national schools and depressed communities in any place, I am reminded of Gujarat.
('38', 203, 2, 21, 426240) I wonder, then, if Gujarat is not out of the competition.
('38', 203, 2, 22, 426298) But I am an optimist, and see rays of hope even in the face of countless disappointments.
('38', 203, 2, 23, 426388) One such ray, of course, is this modest Ashram, for there are still earnest workers to run it.
('38', 203, 2, 24, 426483) May it prosper, and may Bardoli, broken in spirit, and Surat in ruins, shine again and shed lustre on Gujarat and the country.

('38', 204, 2, 3, 426721) [Before March 16, 1927] 1
('38', 204, 3, 4, 426747) MAGANLAL, Kaka Saheb had suggested that the Managing Committee should see all relevant letters so as to know my views on various matters.
('38', 204, 3, 5, 426885) This is right and so henceforth I shall write separately on business matters so that everyone can go through the correspondence.
('38', 204, 3, 6, 427014) Again I find you as uncharitable as before.
('38', 204, 3, 7, 427058) I agree it is unavoidable since you are not aware of it.
('38', 204, 3, 8, 427115) Shake off this attitude.
('38', 204, 3, 9, 427140) You will be able to do so if you try.
('38', 204, 3, 10, 427178) You must participate in the work of the School Committee.
('38', 204, 3, 11, 427236) If you wish to be nominated to the Education Committee, it can be done.
('38', 204, 3, 12, 427308) Do not stand on prestige.
('38', 204, 3, 13, 427334) More when I get your letter.
('38', 204, 3, 14, 427363) Try to pacify Ramachandra.
('38', 204, 3, 15, 427390) You should have a better appreciation of the diffi culties of the lift.

('38', 204, 7, 19, 427597) March 16, 1927
('38', 204, 8, 20, 427612) Gandhiji asked: Those who pledged themselves to wear khaddar, raise their handsall.
('38', 204, 8, 21, 427696) Those who pledged themselves to abjure drinkall.
('38', 204, 8, 22, 427745) Those who have kept their vowsall.
('38', 204, 8, 23, 427780) Those who have broken their vow none.
('38', 204, 9, 24, 427818) The earlier part [of his speech] was by way of appeal to the money lender and the liquor seller, the Bania and the Parsi, to reform their ways, as the latter part was one of congratulation to the Hillmen and urging them to carry on self purification more extensively.
('38', 204, 9, 25, 428086) There was a quaint appeal about the way in which he commended to them the new appellation of Hillmen.
('38', 204, 9, 26, 428188) Why should you be called black people?
('38', 204, 9, 27, 428227) We are all black, the God who coloured our skin being the same, and his brush being the same.
('38', 204, 9, 28, 428321) You will be called Hillmen from today.
('38', 204, 9, 29, 428360) Be you brave as the

('38', 205, 1, 3, 428627) The denizen of the forest is either a wise man, a rishi or a dacoit or a beast of prey.
('38', 205, 1, 4, 428715) You are neither of the last two, so you have to become rishis.
('38', 205, 1, 5, 428778) And there is no lack of opportunity for you.
('38', 205, 1, 6, 428823) None of the wicked temptations of the towns lie in your way.
('38', 205, 1, 7, 428884) You are fitted by nature to live on fruit and root and to eat in order to live, not to live in order to eat, and therefore best fitted to teach us that healthy way of living.
('38', 205, 1, 8, 429059) Learn our sacred lore and with your innate purity of heart tame the lion and the tiger, as did the rishis of old.
('38', 205, 1, 9, 429173) To the women I would say just a word.
('38', 205, 1, 10, 429211) I am glad you have taken to khaddar, I now want you to give up your ugly ornaments which disfigure your limbs, are receptacles of dirt, and badges of slavery.

('38', 205, 6, 16, 429645) MY DEAR MAHATMAJI, I have decided, as you are already aware, to remit to you as before such amount as I think I can reasonably save every month from my salary for the purpose mentioned in my letter to you on the subject in the month of April 2 last.
('38', 205, 6, 17, 429895) I propose to continue this arrangement as far as possible during the whole period of my office as President of the Assembly.
('38', 205, 6, 18, 430020) I enclose herewith a cheque for Rs. 2,000 representing such savings till the end of February.

('38', 206, 1, 3, 430584) If the object is to be attained, the board of trustees should, whilst it ought to be completely national, be representative of as many parties as it is possible to bring at a common board.
('38', 206, 1, 4, 430773) I therefore invite criticism and suggestions from those who approve of the plan.
('38', 206, 1, 5, 430854) I have no desire to take sole charge of the funds or to use them only for the purposes to which my life is devoted.
('38', 206, 1, 6, 430970) I know that I shall be best fulfilling the purpose of Vithalbhais great gift by seeking the co operation of as many as would help.

('38', 206, 2, 8, 431124) 194. NO AND YES
('38', 206, 3, 9, 431140) Comrade Saklatwala is dreadfully in earnest.
('38', 206, 3, 10, 431185) His sincerity is transparent.
('38', 206, 3, 11, 431215) His sacrifices are great.
('38', 206, 3, 12, 431241) His passion for the poor is unquestioned.
('38', 206, 3, 13, 431283) I have therefore given his fervent open appeal 1 to me that close attention which that of a sincere patriot and humanitarian must command.
('38', 206, 3, 14, 431422) But in spite of all my desire to say Yes to his appeal, I must say No if I am to return sincerity for sincerity or if I am to act according to my faith.
('38', 206, 3, 15, 431575) But I can say Yes to his appeal after my own fashion.
('38', 206, 3, 16, 431629) For underneath his intense desire that I should co operate with him on his terms, there is the emphatic implied condition that I must say Yes only if his argument satisfies my head and heart.
('38', 206, 3, 17, 431821) A No uttered from deepest conviction is better and greater than a Yes merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoide trouble.
('38', 206, 3, 18, 431954) In spite of all the desire to offer hearty co operation, I find myself against a blind wall.
('38', 206, 3, 19, 432047) His facts are fiction and his deductions based upon fiction are necessarily baseless.
('38', 206, 3, 20, 432133) And where these facts are true, my whole energy is concentrated upon nullifying their (to me) poisonous results.
('38', 206, 3, 21, 432246) I am sorry, but we do stand at opposite poles.
('38', 206, 3, 22, 432293) There is however one great thing in common between us.
('38', 206, 3, 23, 432348) Both claim to have the good of the country and humanity as our only goal.
('38', 206, 3, 24, 432422) Though therefore we may for the moment seem to be going in opposite directions, I expect we shall meet some day.
('38', 206, 3, 25, 432535) I promise to make ample amends when I discover my error.
('38', 206, 3, 26, 432592) Meanwhile however, my error, since I do not recognize it as such, must be my shield and my solace.
('38', 206, 4, 27, 432691) 1 Saklatwa.las Open Letter to Mahatma Gandhi was released in Bombay on March 8 and was published in The Hindustan Times, 17 3 1927. For excerpts from it, vide Appendix Extracts from Shapurji Saklatvalas Open Letter, 17 3 1927.
('38', 207, 0, 1, 432918) 208 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 207, 1, 2, 432960) For unlikeComrade Saklatwala, I do not believe that multi plication of wants and machinery contrived to supply them is taking the world a single step nearer its goal.
('38', 207, 1, 3, 433127) Comrade Saklatwala swears by the modern rush.
('38', 207, 1, 4, 433173) I whole heartedly detest this mad desire to dest roy distance and time, to increase animal appetites and go to the ends of the earth in search of their satisfaction.
('38', 207, 1, 5, 433339) If modern civilization stands for all this, and I have understood it to do so, I call it satanic and with it the present system of Government, its best exponent.
('38', 207, 1, 6, 433501) I distrust its schemes of amelioration of the lot of the poor, I distrust its currency reform, I distrust its army and navy.
('38', 207, 1, 7, 433626) In the name of civili zation and its own safety this Government has continuously bled the masses, it has enslaved the people, it has bribed the powerful with distinctions and riches and it has sought to crush under the weight of its despotic regulations the liberty loving patriots who would not be won over either by flattery or riches.
('38', 207, 1, 8, 433964) I would destroy that system today, if I had the power.
('38', 207, 1, 9, 434019) I would use the most deadly weapons, if I believed that they would destroy it.
('38', 207, 1, 10, 434098) I refrain only because the use of such weapons would only perpetuate the system though it may des troy its present administrators.
('38', 207, 1, 11, 434229) Those who seek to destroy men rather than their manners adopt the latter and become worse than those whom they destroy under the mistaken belief that the manners will die with the men.
('38', 207, 1, 12, 434414) They do not know the root of the evil.
('38', 207, 1, 13, 434453) The movement of 1920 was designed to show that we could not reform the soulless system by violent means, thus becoming soulless ourselves, but we could do so only by not becoming victims of the system, i.e., by non co operation, by saying an emphatic No to every advance made to entrap us into the nets spread by satan.
('38', 207, 1, 14, 434773) That movement suffered a check but is not dead.
('38', 207, 1, 15, 434821) My promise was conditional.
('38', 207, 1, 16, 434849) The conditions were simple and easy.
('38', 207, 1, 17, 434886) But they pro ved too difficult for those who took a leading part in the movement.
('38', 207, 1, 18, 434968) What Comrade Saklatwala believes to be my error and failure I regard to be the expression of my strength and deep conviction.
('38', 207, 1, 19, 435094) It may be an error but so long as my conviction that it is truth abides, my very error must, as it does, sustain me.
('38', 207, 1, 20, 435211) My retracing my steps at Bardoli I hold to be an act of wisdom and supreme service to the country.
('38', 207, 1, 21, 435310) The Government is the weaker for that decision.
('38', 207, 1, 22, 435358) It would have regained all lost position if I had persisted after Chauri Chaura in
('38', 208, 0, 1, 435441) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 209
('38', 208, 1, 2, 435484) carrying out the terms of what was regarded as an ultimatum 1 to the Viceroy.
('38', 208, 1, 3, 435562) My Comrade is wrong in saying that the South African movement was a failure.
('38', 208, 1, 4, 435639) If it was, my whole life must be written down as a failure.
('38', 208, 1, 5, 435699) And his invitation to me to enlist under his colours must be held to be meaningless.
('38', 208, 1, 6, 435784) South Africa gave the start to my lifes mission.
('38', 208, 1, 7, 435833) Nor do I consider it to be wrong to have offered, during the late War, the services of my companions and myself, under my then convictions, as ambulance men.
('38', 208, 1, 8, 435991) This great M.P. is in a hurry.
('38', 208, 1, 9, 436022) He disdains to study facts.
('38', 208, 1, 10, 436050) Let me inform him that the khadi movement is not on the wane.
('38', 208, 1, 11, 436112) It did last year at least twenty times as much work as during 1920. It is now serving not less than 50,000 spinners in 1,500 villages besides weavers, washermen, printers, dyers and tailors.
('38', 208, 1, 12, 436303) Mr. Saklatwala asks what khaddar stands for.
('38', 208, 1, 13, 436348) Well, it stands for simplicity not shoddiness.
('38', 208, 1, 14, 436395) It sits well on the shoulders of the poor and it can be made, as it was made in the days of yore, to adorn the bodies of the richest and the most artistic men and women.
('38', 208, 1, 15, 436565) It is reviving ancient art and crafts.
('38', 208, 1, 16, 436604) It does not seek to destroy all machinery but it does regulate its use and check its weedy growth.
('38', 208, 1, 17, 436703) It uses machinery for the service of the poorest in their own cottages.
('38', 208, 1, 18, 436775) The wheel is itself an exquisite piece of machinery.
('38', 208, 1, 19, 436828) Khaddar delivers the poor from the bonds of the rich and creates a moral and spiritual bond between the classes and the masses.
('38', 208, 1, 20, 436956) It restores to the poor somewhat of what the rich have taken from them.
('38', 208, 1, 21, 437028) Khaddar does not displace a single cottage industry.
('38', 208, 1, 22, 437081) On the contrary, it is being daily recognized that it is becoming the centre of other village industries.
('38', 208, 1, 23, 437187) Khaddar brings a ray of hope to the widows broken up home.
('38', 208, 1, 24, 437246) But it does not prevent her from earning more if she can.
('38', 208, 1, 25, 437304) It prevents no one from seeking a better occupation.
('38', 208, 1, 26, 437357) Khaddar offers honourable employment to those in need of some.
('38', 208, 1, 27, 437420) It utilizes the idle hours of the nation.
('38', 208, 1, 28, 437462) The esteemed comrade quotes with pride the work of those who offer more lucrative employment.
('38', 208, 1, 29, 437556) Let him know that khaddar does that automatically.
('38', 208, 1, 30, 437607) It cannot put annas into the pockets of the poor without putting rupees into the pockets of some.

('38', 209, 0, 1, 437741) 210 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 209, 1, 2, 437783) Whereas those who begin their work in the cities, though they are no doubt doing good work, touch but the fringe of the question.
('38', 209, 1, 3, 437913) Khaddar touches the very centre and therefore necessarily includes the rest.
('38', 209, 1, 4, 437990) But the whole of the impatient communists letter concentrates itself upon the cities and thus ignores India and Indian conditions which are to be found only in her 7,00,000 villages.
('38', 209, 1, 5, 438173) The half a dozen modern cities are an excrescence and serve at the present moment the evil purpose of draining the life blood of the villages.
('38', 209, 1, 6, 438316) Khaddar is an attempt to revise and reverse the process and establish a better relationship between the cities and the villages.
('38', 209, 1, 7, 438445) The cities with their insolent torts [sic] are a constant menace to the life and liberty of the villagers.
('38', 209, 1, 8, 438552) Khaddar has the greatest organizing power in it because it has itself to be organized and because it affects all India.
('38', 209, 1, 9, 438672) If khaddar rained from heaven it would be a calamity.
('38', 209, 1, 10, 438726) But as it can only be manufactured by the willing co operation of starving millions and thousands of middle class men and women, its success means the best organization conceivable along peaceful lines.
('38', 209, 1, 11, 438929) If cooking had to be revived and required the same organi zation, I should claim for it the same merit that I claim for khaddar.
('38', 209, 1, 12, 439058) My communist comrade finds fault with my work among the labourers in Jamshedpur because I accepted an address in Jamshedpur not from the Tatas but from the employees.
('38', 209, 1, 13, 439225) His disapprobation is due, I expect, to the fact that the late Mr. Ratan Tata was in the chair.
('38', 209, 1, 14, 439321) Well, I am not ashamed of the honour.
('38', 209, 1, 15, 439359) Mr. Tata appeared to me to be a humane and considerate employer.
('38', 209, 1, 16, 439424) He readily granted, I think, all the prayers of the employees and I heard later that the agreement was being honourably kept.
('38', 209, 1, 17, 439550) I do ask and receive donations for my work from the rich as well as the poor.
('38', 209, 1, 18, 439628) The former gladly give me their donations.
('38', 209, 1, 19, 439671) This is no personal triumph.
('38', 209, 1, 20, 439700) It is the triumph of non vio lence which I endeavoured to represent, be it ever so inadequately.
('38', 209, 1, 21, 439797) It is to me a matter of perennial satisfaction that I retain generally the affection and the trust of those whose principles and policies I oppose.
('38', 209, 1, 22, 439945) The South Africans gave me personally their confidence and extended their friendship.
('38', 209, 1, 23, 440031) In spite of my denunciation of British policy and system I enjoy the affection of thousands of Englishmen and women, and in spite of unqualified condemnation of modern materialistic civilization, the circle of European and American friends

('38', 210, 1, 2, 440314) is ever widening.
('38', 210, 1, 3, 440332) It is again a triumph of non violence.
('38', 210, 1, 4, 440371) Lastly about labour in the cities.
('38', 210, 1, 5, 440406) Let there be no misunder standing.
('38', 210, 1, 6, 440441) I am not opposed to organization of labour, but as in every thing else, I want its organization along Indian lines, or if you will, my lines.
('38', 210, 1, 7, 440583) I am doing it.
('38', 210, 1, 8, 440598) The Indian labourer knows it instinctively.
('38', 210, 1, 9, 440642) I do not regard capital to be the enemy of labour.
('38', 210, 1, 10, 440693) I hold their co ordina tion to be perfectly possible.
('38', 210, 1, 11, 440747) The organization of labour that I under took in South Africa, Champaran or Ahmedabad was in no spirit of hostility to the capitalists.
('38', 210, 1, 12, 440882) The resistance in each case and to the extent it was thought necessary was wholly successful.
('38', 210, 1, 13, 440976) My ideal is equal distribution, but so far as I can see, it is not to be realized.
('38', 210, 1, 14, 441059) I therefore work for equitable distribution.
('38', 210, 1, 15, 441104) This I seek to attain through khaddar.
('38', 210, 1, 16, 441143) And since its attainment must sterilize British exploitation at its centre, it is calculated to purify the British connection.
('38', 210, 1, 17, 441270) Hence in that sense khaddar leads to swaraj.
('38', 210, 1, 18, 441315) The Mahatma I must leave to his fate.
('38', 210, 1, 19, 441353) Though a non cooperator I shall gladly subscribe to a bill to make it criminal for anybody to call me Mahatma and to touch my feet.
('38', 210, 1, 20, 441485) Where I can impose the law myself, i.e., at the Ashram, the practice is criminal.

('38', 210, 6, 26, 441677) MY DEAR FRIEND, I get your letters regularly.
('38', 210, 6, 27, 441723) You asked me how to answer the conundrums that your fellow passengers had put before you regar ding Indias alleged indifference about total prohibition.
('38', 210, 6, 28, 441876) As, in my travels, I had not your address, I could not write to you, but I wrote a leading article 2 in Young India based upon your letter, which I hope you saw and which contained the answer you wanted.
('38', 210, 6, 29, 442080) If you need anything more, you will please refer to me.

('38', 211, 1, 2, 442354) your experiences at the India Office.
('38', 211, 1, 3, 442392) I am quite sure that the steps you are taking to equip yourself for the task are the proper and necessary steps.
('38', 211, 1, 4, 442505) They alone can give you the knowledge, experience and confidence required for the struggle that is in front of you.
('38', 211, 1, 5, 442621) I have read your interview with The Observer.
('38', 211, 1, 6, 442667) It was reproduced in one of the Indian dailies.
('38', 211, 1, 7, 442715) I certainly agree with you that if you had not given that interview it would have been better.
('38', 211, 1, 8, 442810) But, if the reporter has correctly reported you what does it matter even if it contains some erroneous deductions.

('38', 211, 5, 15, 443305) Do whatever work you can while taking care of your health.
('38', 211, 5, 16, 443364) Look after the children well, as if they were your own children.
('38', 211, 5, 17, 443429) Keep Vimu with you if she agrees.
('38', 211, 5, 18, 443463) I do not know where you have decided to stay.
('38', 211, 5, 19, 443509) If you are going to stay in the hostel, Vimu will have to live away from you.

('38', 211, 8, 24, 443817) March, 19, 1927 The Gurukul was Swamijis best creation and though he is physically not with us he lives amongst us in his Gurukul.
('38', 211, 8, 25, 443948) It was his
('38', 211, 9, 26, 443959) 1 Inferred from the fact that Gandhiji returned to Bardoli from Vedchhi on March 17, 1927 which was a Thursday.
('38', 211, 9, 27, 444071) 2 Delivered on the occasion of its silver jubilee.
('38', 211, 9, 28, 444122) This is from a report by Mahadev Desai.

('38', 212, 1, 2, 444205) most original contribution to education, inasmuchas when we had lost our heads over Western education he decided that we should think and act and educate ourselves in the Vedic way.
('38', 212, 1, 3, 444387) Swamiji will live with us so long as his Gurukul lasts and the Gurukul will last so long as there is a single graduate of the Gurukul prepared to serve it with truth and self sacrifice, and with the courage which was Swamijis and which is a synonym for forgiveness.
('38', 212, 1, 4, 444653) Then there is brahmacharya on which Swamiji laid the greatest emphasis and without which all your education will come to naught.
('38', 212, 1, 5, 444782) Avoiding lustful contact with women is not the last word on brahmacharya.
('38', 212, 1, 6, 444856) It is only the beginning and the perf ection is reached when the brahmachari refuses to be ruffled or angry, no matter what provocation is offered him.
('38', 212, 1, 7, 445008) For anger is the destruction of virya, the vital essence.
('38', 212, 2, 8, 445066) I appeal to you to carry on the work, by forgetting which you will forget Swamiji and by killing which you will kill Swamiji.
('38', 212, 2, 9, 445192) Remember Abdul Rashid has not murdered Swamiji, he has made him a martyr.
('38', 212, 2, 10, 445266) The day you forget the Swamis mission will be his day of death.
('38', 212, 2, 11, 445330) The Swami was a great lover of untouchables.
('38', 212, 2, 12, 445375) All who love him are in duty bound to carry on his mission.
('38', 212, 2, 13, 445435) It will be a great misfortune if the Swamis beloved cause is given up because of lack of funds or workers.
('38', 212, 3, 14, 445542) Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said that Malaviyaji has pleaded more strongly for khaddar than he could do, but he too wanted to appeal as khaddar helped the solution of the problem of untouchability.
('38', 212, 3, 15, 445735) Khaddar and charkha provided food to the teeming millions, mostly the depressed classes.
('38', 212, 3, 16, 445824) Hence khaddar and the removal of untou chability were interwoven and could not be separated.
('38', 212, 3, 17, 445917) If you want to save our ancient civilization and if you feel it a duty to save the villagers from destruction, then take up the message of khaddar from village to village.
('38', 212, 4, 18, 446089) Concluding, Mr. Gandhi said : Truth is the bedrock of happy live.
('38', 212, 4, 19, 446155) Be true to yourselves and the country.

('38', 213, 4, 7, 446965) If I have criticized the Arya Samaj, I am also anxious to give my tribute of praise for its work.
('38', 213, 4, 8, 447063) And those who give hearty praise have a right to criticize too.
('38', 213, 4, 9, 447127) Of all religious and political bodies that have come into being of late years the Arya Samaj has made probably the greatest contribution to bridge the gulf between the classes and the masses that had been widening ever since the advent of the British in India.
('38', 213, 4, 10, 447388) No institution is perfect, and I could, if I would, point out some of the defects of the Gurukul.
('38', 213, 4, 11, 447486) But there is no questioning the fact that it has rendered substantial service to the country.
('38', 213, 4, 12, 447580) Whenever I see a Punjabi youth capable of reading and writing Devanagari, I imme diately conclude that he must have had his training in one of the Gurukuls.
('38', 213, 4, 13, 447737) They have done more than any other institutions in these parts to revivify Sanskrit learning and Aryan culture.

('38', 214, 2, 3, 448004) March 20, 1927 It is the duty of every Indian student to learn Sanskrit.
('38', 214, 2, 4, 448077) It certainly is the duty of the Hindus, but it is also the Muslims because, in the final analysis, their forbears too were Rama and Krishna and they ought to know Sanskrit in order to know them.
('38', 214, 2, 5, 448272) However, to maintain contacts with the Muslims, it is also the duty of Hindus to learn the formers language.
('38', 214, 2, 6, 448381) Today we run away from each others languages because we have become mad.
('38', 214, 2, 7, 448454) Take it for a certainty that an institution which teaches fear and hatred of others surely is not a national institution.
('38', 214, 3, 8, 448576) Gandhiji said that national institutions should produce messengers of Hindu Muslim unity.
('38', 214, 3, 9, 448666) Institutions producing fanatical Hindus and Muslims were worth destruction.
('38', 214, 3, 10, 448742) Educational institutions were not meant to produce bigoted persons.
('38', 214, 3, 11, 448810) He was sure that there was no reason for disappointment and still the cause could prosper if self reliant and self sacrificing teachers were available.

('38', 214, 7, 22, 449312) But Jamnalalji does.
('38', 214, 7, 23, 449333) You will go for having contact with him and there will be nothing but Hindi there to speak.

('38', 215, 7, 14, 450595) MAMA, I was glad to read your letter.
('38', 215, 7, 15, 450633) One should say you have acted nobly if you relieved Gangabehn without rancour and as a matter of dharma, and I am sure you will have peace hereafter because your mind would have regained its equanimity.
('38', 215, 7, 16, 450836) We ought to be only too glad to have some of our dear ones spiritually inclined and regarding the entire world as their own family.
('38', 215, 7, 17, 450968) I hope you are now better.
('38', 215, 7, 18, 450995) Please write to me again.

('38', 216, 3, 4, 451318) BHAISHRI FULCHAND, Your letter about Rs. 2,000 has been referred to me.
('38', 216, 3, 5, 451390) I have not a cowrie left with me.
('38', 216, 3, 6, 451424) Whatever had been saved has been spent, so I shall have to go abegging once again.
('38', 216, 3, 7, 451507) I have written to them to send you the amount this time, what ever their difficulty.
('38', 216, 3, 8, 451592) But what about later?
('38', 216, 3, 9, 451614) Now you will have to get your budget approved by me.
('38', 216, 3, 10, 451667) You i.e., you and Devchandbhaishould have the influence to raise the funds needed to run the Parishad.
('38', 216, 3, 11, 451770) If this cannot be done, how long can we hold on?
('38', 216, 3, 12, 451819) Budgets for all the other centres should also receive prior approval.
('38', 216, 3, 13, 451889) You should show to Nanabhai the budget for your school in particular.
('38', 216, 3, 14, 451959) He should inspect the school and I shall try to raise the amount that he approves of.
('38', 216, 3, 15, 452045) I am always thinking of affiliating all the national schools to the Vidyapith, because it is now becoming difficult to ask for separate funds.
('38', 216, 3, 16, 452188) Of course we do collect from a great many donors in the name of khadi.
('38', 216, 3, 17, 452259) I had hoped to accomplish something at the Parishad; but it did not come off.
('38', 216, 3, 18, 452337) So now we have to think anew since it has been postponed to August.
('38', 216, 3, 19, 452405) So get your budget first sanctioned by me before you put in your next demand.
('38', 216, 3, 20, 452483) Ultimately each [institution] will have to stand on its own as in the rest of the country.
('38', 216, 3, 21, 452574) Or we shall have to draw up some special scheme for educa tion in Maha Gujarat.

('38', 217, 1, 4, 453162) I write all this for your co workers to think over.

('38', 217, 7, 12, 453557) He is a man of truth and aspires for moksha.
('38', 217, 7, 13, 453602) You and I ought to reconsider a matter about which he has doubts.
('38', 217, 7, 14, 453668) You and I should, therefore, endeavour to convince him that the step you propose to take is not contrary to dharma.
('38', 217, 7, 15, 453784) What Chi.
('38', 217, 7, 16, 453794) Mama has written can be considered good, provided she has not done it in anger.
('38', 217, 7, 17, 453874) It is all right if you take the step after mature deliberation.

('38', 217, 12, 25, 454250) When I get the money it will help the charkha movement.
('38', 217, 12, 26, 454306) I am very glad that pujya Malaviyaji is being progressively drawn to the charkha.
('38', 217, 12, 27, 454388) I shall want large amounts for the charkha work.
('38', 217, 12, 28, 454437) With his help I can raise larger funds.

('38', 218, 0, 1, 454503) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 219
('38', 218, 1, 2, 454546) Bhaiji and Rameshwarji have decided to donate money for the construction of reservoirs of water for the Antyajas; it will be spent as directed by them.
('38', 218, 1, 3, 454698) I did not know Parasram collected scraps of paper.
('38', 218, 1, 4, 454749) I have warned him against this fault.
('38', 218, 1, 5, 454787) He will write to you.
('38', 218, 1, 6, 454809) He had no wrong motive.
('38', 218, 1, 7, 454833) He is a simpleton but I can get work out of him.
('38', 218, 1, 8, 454882) He wishes to live with pujya Malaviyaji and Rabindranath for some days.
('38', 218, 1, 9, 454954) I have asked him to try on his own to get himself admitted to their service.
('38', 218, 1, 10, 455031) In my opinion the following rules of conduct must be observed to safeguard ones health while staying in Europe: 1. We should not take food to which we are not used.
('38', 218, 1, 11, 455196) 2. In Europe they eat six or seven times a day, but we must not eat more than thrice.
('38', 218, 1, 12, 455282) Do not get addicted to taking chocolate or other such things between meals.
('38', 218, 1, 13, 455358) 3. They eat even at 1 oclock at night.
('38', 218, 1, 14, 455397) But we must eat nothing after 8 in the evening.
('38', 218, 1, 15, 455445) When visiting people and places we are, it is believed, expected to take tea, etc.
('38', 218, 1, 16, 455528) This is not true.
('38', 218, 1, 17, 455546) 4. One should go walking at least six miles daily.
('38', 218, 1, 18, 455597) One should walk both in the morning and in the evening.
('38', 218, 1, 19, 455653) 5. It is not right to wear too many clothes, secret being that one must not feel cold.
('38', 218, 1, 20, 455740) Walking shakes off cold.
('38', 218, 1, 21, 455765) 6. It is not at all necessary to put on European dress.
('38', 218, 1, 22, 455821) 7. One should try to get acquainted with the poor people of Europe; walking helps such acquaintance.
('38', 218, 1, 23, 455922) When there is time at your disposal, it is better to walk.
('38', 218, 1, 24, 455981) 8. Do not persuade yourself for a moment that since you have gone to Europe you have got to do something, Attempt only what clean and spontaneous efforts can accomplish.
('38', 218, 1, 25, 456151) 9. Your stay in Europe will, I feel, result in at least one good thing.
('38', 218, 1, 26, 456223) You can certainly build up your body.
('38', 218, 1, 27, 456261) 10. May God save you from mental debauchery; very few Indians escape it.
('38', 218, 1, 28, 456334) While their way of living is natural to them, it only helps to intoxicate us.
('38', 218, 1, 29, 456412) 11. The practice of reading the Gita and the Ramayana must in no case be given up.
('38', 218, 1, 30, 456495) If you have not been doing it already, the sooner you begin the better.
('38', 218, 1, 31, 456567) I am sure you did not expect advice in such minute detail.
('38', 218, 1, 32, 456626) This I am giving because I have great faith in the goodness of yourself and

('38', 219, 1, 3, 456759) Few rich people possess your goodness and humility.
('38', 219, 1, 4, 456811) I seek an intense growth in these qualities and I want to put them to use in the service of the nation.
('38', 219, 1, 5, 456915) I have no faith in the principle of shatham prati shathyam 1. Therefore, wherever I see purity, truth and non viol ence, etc., even in the smallest degree, I start collecting the treasure with the care of a miser, and it makes me happy.

('38', 219, 7, 12, 457375) [March 21, 1927] 2
('38', 219, 8, 13, 457394) [QUESTION:] 1. Do you feel it unbearable to live under the present political thraldom or not?
('38', 219, 8, 14, 457488) [ANSWER :] I do.
('38', 219, 9, 15, 457505) 2. If so, are you yourself individually prepared to get rid of it and gain political freedom or not?
('38', 219, 10, 16, 457606) 3. Is there any objection to suppose that "your being prepared" means that
('38', 219, 11, 17, 457681) you have acquired two spiritual qualities, viz., soul force and love of freedom ?
('38', 219, 11, 18, 457763) You may suppose so.
('38', 219, 12, 19, 457783) 4. Does not "preparation for the attainment of freedom" mean making the Indians endowed with the qualities and power necessary for such attainment which you respectively have acquired?
('38', 219, 12, 20, 457968) It does mean.
('38', 219, 13, 21, 457982) 5. Is not intellectual and moral education necessary for acquiring such
('38', 219, 14, 22, 458054) qualities?

('38', 220, 1, 2, 458162) 6. If so, what are the ways of educating the whole nation and how much time will it take to do it?
('38', 220, 1, 3, 458261) Through spinning.
('38', 220, 2, 4, 458279) 7. Is not the creation of a feeling of thorough disgust for political subjection extremely necessary?
('38', 220, 3, 5, 458381) 8. If so, what may be in your opinion the percentage of people having such a feeling among the three hundred millions of Indians?
('38', 220, 3, 6, 458511) Difficult to estimate.
('38', 220, 4, 7, 458534) 9. To create the consciousness of bondage is it not necessary to have the knowledge of the past glory of the motherland and to feel real restlessness on account of the present painful condition?
('38', 220, 5, 8, 458729) 10. Is it possible to create soul force in the absence of the said knowledge or the said restlessness ?
('38', 220, 5, 9, 458833) Hardly.
('38', 220, 6, 10, 458841) 11. Do acquisition of soul force and the possession of the power to suffer any pains boldly and calmly constitute the chief pillars of your spiritual activities or not?
('38', 220, 6, 11, 459010) To an extent, yes.
('38', 220, 7, 12, 459029) 12. Where, under what circumstances and how are the people to make use of their soul force for wresting power from the rulers ?
('38', 220, 7, 13, 459157) Throughout the country by non violent non co operation.
('38', 220, 8, 14, 459213) 13. What kind of intellectual, moral and physical preparation is necessary on the part of the people for the accomplishment of these two objects, viz., civil disobedience and refusal to pay Government taxes?
('38', 220, 8, 15, 459421) Hand spinning gives them an idea of non violence and self confidence.
('38', 220, 9, 16, 459491) 14. If our preparedness be looked upon as being complete, i.e., 16 annas, what proportion of the preparedness in terms of annas is necessary, in your opinion, on the part of your followers or the general public to bring about the attainment of freedom?
('38', 220, 9, 17, 459744) Eight annas one pie.
('38', 220, 10, 18, 459765) 15. Is the public so prepared today?
('38', 220, 10, 19, 459802) If not how much time do you think, it will take to be so prepared?
('38', 220, 10, 20, 459869) Not yet; unable to prophesy.
('38', 220, 11, 21, 459898) 16. What percentage of people in the country knows the fact that there is a unique personality like Mahatma Gandhi in India?
('38', 220, 11, 22, 460023) I have no idea.
('38', 221, 0, 1, 460039) 222 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 221, 1, 2, 460081) 17. If it is taken for granted that one among a thousand may know it, how many persons per hundred thousand may have, in your opinion, the knowledge of Mahatmaji's ideas of freedom and his activities?
('38', 221, 1, 3, 460282) 1/1000th of those that know.
('38', 221, 2, 4, 460311) 18. It seems that there is complete darkness with respect to such knowledge; if the darkness is to be dispelled, how long will it have to be done?
('38', 221, 2, 5, 460458) As long as is necessary.
('38', 221, 3, 6, 460483) 19. Do you say that it is impossible to attain swaraj even if, in the absence of unity between the Hindus and Muslims, people of both communities should feel the miseries of political bondage to be unbearable and should struggle to be free from it, and even if a feeling should arise in both the communities that life without freedom is worse than death?
('38', 221, 3, 7, 460838) I do not, if both feel as you suggest.
('38', 221, 4, 8, 460877) 20. Do you say that a painful consciousness of the unbearable political condition has not the power to bring into being the union of the communities belonging to two different cultures ?
('38', 221, 4, 9, 461064) It has the power.
('38', 221, 5, 10, 461082) 21. The religious persecution of the Hindus by the Mohammedans was the principal cause which contributed to the attainment of freedom in the days of Shivaji and people belonging to different castes became united to free themselves from religious persecutions.
('38', 221, 5, 11, 461342) Readers of history do know the fact that the establishment of maths by Ramdas proved very useful in this respect.
('38', 221, 5, 12, 461456) Is it not the fact that the freedom which the people want today is for freeing themselves from the political, industrial and commercial oppression?
('38', 221, 5, 13, 461604) Yes; indeed.
('38', 221, 6, 14, 461617) 22. Whether untouchability goes away or not, whether the Hindu Moham medan disunion disappears or not, if, in spite of the existence of these two things, we could have two thousand persons maddened with the desire for freedom and endowed with soul force, will you say that these men will not be able to gain the freedom of the country?
('38', 221, 6, 15, 461953) These two thousands will sweep away disunion and untou chability and bring swaraj.
('38', 221, 7, 16, 462036) 23. If 1,400 civilians can hold such a vast country like India under subjugation will you say that the said two thousand persons endowed with the said qualities will not be able to take back India?
('38', 221, 7, 17, 462234) Vide answer 22.
('38', 221, 8, 18, 462250) 24. In short, do you say that it is not possible to attain swaraj even if the one emotion of feeling a strong disgust for bondage and regarding life without liberty to be unbearable, pervades the whole of India?
('38', 221, 8, 19, 462462) Mere emotion will never bring swaraj.
('38', 222, 0, 1, 462500) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 223
('38', 222, 1, 2, 462543) 25. If it is seen that the said emotion is quite indispensable and that it would lead to the attainment of swaraj, can it be created by your present lectures on khaddar?
('38', 222, 1, 3, 462713) My lectures on khaddar are converting that emotion into energy.

('38', 222, 9, 14, 463224) Parting this time was particularly painful as I was anxious to talk to you about things and to have your views on many more.
('38', 222, 9, 15, 463349) But who after all is free?
('38', 222, 9, 16, 463376) We are in Gods hands and we dance as He makes us to.
('38', 222, 9, 17, 463429) If we acted according to our own desires we would come to grief.
('38', 222, 9, 18, 463494) And so I do not worry although my wish was not fulfilled.

('38', 223, 1, 3, 464057) For the present I do not want any one of you to give all your time to that work, but since this duty is yours by birth and training, I entrust to you the responsibility of seeing that the cooking is well done and that the kitchen is clean.
('38', 223, 1, 4, 464297) These two tasks are just the right ones for you.

('38', 223, 6, 10, 464528) ON THE TRAIN, AFTER BHARATPUR March 22, 1927
('38', 223, 7, 11, 464573) MIRA, The parting today was sad, because I saw that I pained you.
('38', 223, 7, 12, 464639) And yet it was inevitable.
('38', 223, 7, 13, 464666) I want you to be a perfect woman.
('38', 223, 7, 14, 464700) I want you to shed all angularities.
('38', 223, 7, 15, 464737) All unnecessary reserve must go.
('38', 223, 7, 16, 464770) Ashram is the centre of your home, but wherever you happen to be must be your home.
('38', 223, 7, 17, 464854) Without being a burden on people with whom we come in contact, we must get the things we need from them.
('38', 223, 7, 18, 464959) We must feel one with all.
('38', 223, 7, 19, 464986) And I have discovered that we never give without receiving consciously or unconsciously.
('38', 223, 7, 20, 465075) There is a reserve which I want us all to have.
('38', 223, 7, 21, 465123) But that reserve must be a fruit of self denial, not sensitiveness.
('38', 223, 7, 22, 465191) Yours is due to sensitiveness.
('38', 223, 7, 23, 465222) This must go.
('38', 223, 7, 24, 465236) I thought I would draw your attention.
('38', 223, 7, 25, 465275) But I saw that I should have waited.
('38', 223, 7, 26, 465312) However, the thing is done.
('38', 223, 7, 27, 465340) Do throw off the nervousness.
('38', 223, 7, 28, 465370) You must not cling to me as in this body.
('38', 223, 7, 29, 465412) The spirit without the body is ever with you.
('38', 223, 7, 30, 465458) And that is more than the feeble embodied imprisoned spirit with all the limita tions that flesh is heir to.
('38', 223, 7, 31, 465567) The spirit without the flesh is perfect, and that is all we need.
('38', 223, 7, 32, 465633) This can be felt only when we practise detachment.
('38', 223, 7, 33, 465684) This you must now try to achieve.
('38', 223, 7, 34, 465718) This is how I would grow if I were you.
('38', 223, 7, 35, 465758) But you should grow along your own lines.
('38', 223, 7, 36, 465800) You will therefore reject all I have said in this

('38', 224, 1, 4, 466018) Resist me when you must.
('38', 224, 1, 5, 466043) For I may judge you wrongly in spite of all my love for you.

('38', 224, 5, 12, 466376) March 23, 1927
('38', 224, 6, 13, 466391) Replying, Gandhiji began to address the gathering in Gujarati when he was requested to speak in Hindi as there was a large section of Madrasis and others, who could not understand Gujarati.
('38', 224, 6, 14, 466581) Gandhiji, however, took votes and according to the majority began to speak in Gujarati but assured the minority that their claim would not be neglected.
('38', 224, 6, 15, 466734) He said: The fear entertained by Mr. J. K. Mehta is well founded and I am really going to hit as hard as a man with non violence as his creed can do for the wide difference between the amount given at Santa Cruz six years ago and the one 2 given today.
('38', 224, 6, 16, 466987) It was only on account of the pressing invitation of Mr. Mehta that I agreed to come here instead of going to Rewari as was originally fixed.
('38', 224, 6, 17, 467129) You perhaps know that though I am not neglecting the cities I have been going to the villages very often these days because India resides not in her handful of towns but in villages.
('38', 224, 6, 18, 467312) Even there it is not difficult to collect Rs. 3,000. You will perhaps be surprised to learn that the villages in Maharashtra and Bihar contributed a lakh and a quarter each during my last tour there.
('38', 224, 6, 19, 467512) And khaddar too is spreading fast and wide in villages.
('38', 224, 6, 20, 467568) I shall quote figures which will prove, in spite of all the odd
('38', 224, 7, 21, 467632) 1 In reply to a welcome address by Jaisukhlal K. Mehta, Chairman, Bombay Suburban District Congress Committee 2 Rs. 3,000; against 52,000, six years earlier
('38', 225, 0, 1, 467789) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 225, 1, 2, 467831) rumours that khaddar is extinct, that khaddar is produced 20 times more than it was being manufactured in 1920, i.e., in the beginning of the movement.
('38', 225, 1, 3, 467983) In 1926, khaddar worth at least Rs. 20 lakhs was manufactured and at least 50,000 women scattered in 1,500 different villages of the country were given work of spinning for which they were paid over Rs. 9 lakhs.
('38', 225, 1, 4, 468195) But this position is not at all satisfactory.
('38', 225, 1, 5, 468241) It does not satisfy me.
('38', 225, 1, 6, 468265) I have found that khaddar is rarely seen in Bombay and other cities.
('38', 225, 1, 7, 468334) In Bombay in 1921, the case was quite different.
('38', 225, 1, 8, 468383) I can account for the present slackness on two grounds that either those who were wearing khaddar before have changed their opinion or that they were playing a false part in 1921. Although this is not the occasion on which I can speak either on non co operation or Hindu Muslim unity, I should state clearlythat my faith in those things is as great and as firm as it ever was.
('38', 225, 1, 9, 468760) I should say it is greater.
('38', 225, 1, 10, 468788) If I want swaraj and swaraj of the type I have been struggling for all along the last few years, I cannot help feeling that Hindu Muslim unity is absolutely necessary.
('38', 225, 1, 11, 468956) But as one who can know human nature, I have found that the whole atmosphere is changed.
('38', 225, 1, 12, 469045) But it is not so with khaddar.
('38', 225, 1, 13, 469076) The result of the khaddar work is not disappointing.
('38', 225, 1, 14, 469129) I have found that people are not tired of it.
('38', 225, 1, 15, 469175) And for this we need not rely on newspapers which as a matter of fact are read only in cities.
('38', 225, 1, 16, 469270) I have found no newspapers in Hardwar and yet Rs. 2 lakhs were easily collected there.
('38', 225, 1, 17, 469357) That place is not like Bombay which seems to me to be an offshoot of England.
('38', 225, 1, 18, 469435) The money that I have been collecting at present goes to the All India Deshbandhu Das Memorial Fund which is to be spent in village organization.
('38', 225, 1, 19, 469581) The fitting memorial to the late Deshbandhu would be a thorough organization of villages and I dare say that charkha is the only way to organize the villages of India.
('38', 225, 1, 20, 469749) I can give you an example of the Raniparaj community of the Surat District where through the message of the charkha the community in about 104 villages has been thoroughly organized.
('38', 225, 1, 21, 469932) 1 The illiterate women of that community have given up wearing heavy ornaments and all of them men, women and children wore pure khaddar.
('38', 225, 1, 22, 470070) It is for work among such classes and villages that money is wanted.
('38', 225, 1, 23, 470139) I am the self appointed barrister of the millions of poor peopleDaridran aray anasof India and in their name I appeal to you the richer classes to

('38', 226, 3, 5, 470506) I cull the following from gems the friend whom I have already introduced to the reader sends for my day of silence:
('38', 226, 4, 6, 470622) The tongue of man reveals so imperfectly the secret mysteries of God,
('38', 226, 5, 7, 470692) that words would have been to us rather a hindrance than a consolation.
('38', 226, 5, 8, 470764) BROTHER GILES
('38', 226, 6, 9, 470778) Settle yourselves in solitude and you will come upon God in your selves.
('38', 226, 7, 10, 470851) Thou needst not call Him to thee from a distance, thy opening and His
('38', 226, 8, 11, 470921) entering are but one moment.
('38', 226, 8, 12, 470950) It is harder for Him to wait, than for thee.

('38', 226, 11, 15, 471067) The following 1 is a free translation made by Mahadev Desai of an accurate account vividly told in the pages of Navajivan by a khadi worker of pauperism in parts of Bardoli taluk which is supposed to be one of the most fertile places of Gujarat The account is written in the form of a story the writer bids fair to become the peoplss poet of a very high order.
('38', 226, 11, 16, 471428) Its artistic beauty adds to its intrinsic worth I commend it specially to the attention of the sceptic.

('38', 226, 12, 18, 471555) 215. KANGRI GURUKUL
('38', 226, 13, 19, 471575) Kangri Gurukul was the body in which the soul of Shraddhan anji resided, no matter where its temporary earthly tabernacle wandered from time to time, and Shraddhanandji lives so long as the Gurukul lives The best memorial therefore that can be erected to the memory of the deceased martyr is to perpetuate the Gurukul.
('38', 226, 13, 20, 471894) No doubt the really permanent memorial will have to come through the

('38', 227, 0, 1, 471985) 228 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 227, 1, 2, 472027) character of the professors and the scholars of the Gurukul and thr ough their determination to retain in it the predominance of ancient teaching and conduct based on it.
('38', 227, 1, 3, 472198) Shradhanandji used with ample justification to plead that his Gurukul was a national institution in the non co operation sense long before the birth of Non co oper ation.
('38', 227, 1, 4, 472369) He believed that to belong to a Government educational insti tution was to subscribe to the predominance of Western influence whether we willed or no.
('38', 227, 1, 5, 472520) He did not object to assimilating what was useful of the West on his own terms and in his own time.
('38', 227, 1, 6, 472620) To be a fitting memorial of the Swami the Gurukul must therefore keep its complete independence of the Government.
('38', 227, 1, 7, 472735) And it is a matter of no small satisfaction that the Gurukul in spite of its independence of Governrnent aid or influence continues to grow in numbers as I hope too it does in character, in the spirit of its revered founder.
('38', 227, 1, 8, 472960) But if the memorial depends for its real existence ultimately on the character of the scholars and the professors it has to depend presently upon financial support from the public.
('38', 227, 1, 9, 473141) Acharya Ramadeva has issued an appeal for three lakhs of rupees.
('38', 227, 1, 10, 473206) I understand that nearly two lakhs are already subscribed.
('38', 227, 1, 11, 473265) The scene I witnessed when the appeal 1 was made in that huge pandal on the Gurukul ground on the 19th instant was a never to be forgotten sight.
('38', 227, 1, 12, 473411) 2 Peoplemen and womenvied with one another in pouring their rupees and notes into the buckets with which voluntecrs moved about among the visitors.
('38', 227, 1, 13, 473559) There were hardly any coppers to be seen.
('38', 227, 1, 14, 473601) I heartily commend this appeal to the attention of the public.
('38', 227, 1, 15, 473664) I have stated my differences with the Arya Samaj and its doctrines.
('38', 227, 1, 16, 473732) They abide.
('38', 227, 1, 17, 473744) I have my differences about the conduct of Gurukul.
('38', 227, 1, 18, 473796) But I am not blind to the services of the Arya Samaj and the necessity of Gurukuls.
('38', 227, 1, 19, 473880) They have revivified religion, if they have also limited its growth.
('38', 227, 1, 20, 473949) Every reform has that tendency in it.
('38', 227, 1, 21, 473987) The wise sift the good from the bad and conserve what is good.
('38', 227, 1, 22, 474050) The Gurukuls has much in it to conserve and those who would want it to be better than it is have but to prove their friendliness before they seek to introduce changes for its betterment.
('38', 227, 1, 23, 474237) I have therefore no hesitation in identifying myself with the appeal for funds.
('38', 227, 1, 24, 474317) There should be no delay or difficulty in making up the modest sum required.

('38', 228, 1, 3, 474633) SELF INDULGENCE 1
('38', 228, 2, 4, 474651) That the first edition was sold out practically within a week of its publication is a matter of joy to me.
('38', 228, 2, 5, 474758) The correspondence that the series of articles collected in this volume has given rise to shows the need for such a publication.
('38', 228, 2, 6, 474887) May those who have not made self indul gence a religion, but who are struggling to regain lost self control, which should under normal conditions be our natural state, find some help from a perusal of these pages.
('38', 228, 2, 7, 475101) For their guidance the following instructions may prove useful: 1. Remember if you are married that your wife is your friend, companion and co worker, not an instrument of sexual enjoyment.
('38', 228, 2, 8, 475291) 2. Self control is the law of your being.
('38', 228, 2, 9, 475333) Therefore the sexual act can be performed only when both desire it and that too subject to rules which in their lucidity both may have agreed upon.
('38', 228, 2, 10, 475481) 3. If you are unmarried you owe it to yourself, to society and to your future partner to keep yourself pure.
('38', 228, 2, 11, 475590) If you cultivate this sense of loyalty, you will find it as an infallible protection against temptation.
('38', 228, 2, 12, 475695) 4. Think always of that unseen Power which though we may never see we all feel within watching and noting every impure thought and you will find that Power ever helping you.
('38', 228, 2, 13, 475869) 5. Laws governing a life of self restraint must be necessary different from a life of self indulgence.
('38', 228, 2, 14, 475972) Therefore you will regulate your society, your reading, your haunts of recreation and your food.
('38', 228, 2, 15, 476069) You will seek the society of the good and the pure.
('38', 228, 2, 16, 476121) You will resolutely refrain from reading passion breeding novels and magazines and read the works that sustain humanity.
('38', 228, 2, 17, 476242) You will make one book your constant companion for referen ces and guidance.
('38', 228, 2, 18, 476319) You will avoid theatres and cinemas.
('38', 228, 2, 19, 476356) Recreation is where you may not dissipate yourself but recreate yourself You will therefore attend bhajan mandalis where the word and the tune uplift the soul.
('38', 228, 2, 20, 476516) You will cat not to satisfy your palate but your

('38', 229, 1, 3, 476667) A self indulgent man lives to eat; a self restrained man eats to live.
('38', 229, 1, 4, 476738) Therefore you will abstain from all irritating condi ments, alcohol which excites the nerves, and narcotics which deaden the sense of right and wrong.
('38', 229, 1, 5, 476889) You will regulate the quantity and times of your meals.
('38', 229, 1, 6, 476945) 6. When your passions threaten to get the better of you go down on your knees and cry out to God for help.
('38', 229, 1, 7, 477052) Ramanama is my infallible Help.
('38', 229, 1, 8, 477084) As extraneous aid take a hip bath i.e., sit in a tubfull of cold water with your legs out of it, and you will find your passions have immediately cooled.
('38', 229, 1, 9, 477238) Sit in it for a rew minutes unless you are weak and there I danger of a chill.
('38', 229, 1, 10, 477317) 7. Take brisk walking exercise in the open air early in the morning and at night before going to bed.
('38', 229, 1, 11, 477419) 8. Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise, is a sound proverb.
('38', 229, 1, 12, 477513) 9 oclock to bed and 4 oclock to rise is a good rule.
('38', 229, 1, 13, 477566) Go to bed on an empty stomach.
('38', 229, 1, 14, 477597) Therefore your last meal must not be after 6 p.m.
('38', 229, 1, 15, 477647) 9. Remember that man is a representative of God to serve all that lives and thus to express Gods dignity and love.
('38', 229, 1, 16, 477762) Let service be your sole joy and you will need no other enjoyment in life.

('38', 229, 3, 19, 477892) I do not propose to publish your letter in defence of the purdah.
('38', 229, 3, 20, 477958) I am of opinion that the purdah in India is recent institution and was adopted during the period of Hindu decline.
('38', 229, 3, 21, 478073) In the age when proud Draupadi and spotless Sita lived there could be no purdah.
('38', 229, 3, 22, 478154) Gargi could not have held her discourses from behind the purdah.
('38', 229, 3, 23, 478219) Nor is the purdah universal in India.
('38', 229, 3, 24, 478257) It is unknown in the Deccan, Gujarat and the Punjab.
('38', 229, 3, 25, 478310) It is unknown among the peasantry and one does not hear of any untoward consequences of the comparative freedom which women in these provinces and among peasantry enjoy.
('38', 229, 3, 26, 478480) Nor will it be just to say that the women or men in the other parts of the world are less moral because of the absence of the purdah system.
('38', 229, 3, 27, 478621) A reader of young India seeks to defend everything that is ancient.

('38', 230, 1, 3, 478896) And who shall say what is really ancient?
('38', 230, 1, 4, 478938) Are all the hundered and eight Upanishads of equal sanctity?
('38', 230, 1, 5, 478999) It seems to me that we must test on the anvil of reason everything that is capable of being tested by it and reject that which does not satisfy it even though it may appear in an ancient garb.

('38', 230, 3, 8, 479243) Thus writes Sjt.
('38', 230, 3, 9, 479260) S. D. Nadkarni :
('38', 230, 4, 10, 479277) In October 1921, to a correspondent asking the question, Is your soul force attainable by the masses?, you replied : They have it already in abundance.
('38', 230, 4, 11, 479429) Once upon a time an expediton of French scientists set out in search of knowledge and in due course reached India.
('38', 230, 4, 12, 479544) They tried hard to find it, as they had expected, among the learned ones, but failed.
('38', 230, 4, 13, 479630) Unexpectedly they found it in a parish home (Young India, 27 10 1927, p.
('38', 230, 5, 14, 479703) I had then thought in my innocence that you were referring to some real incident you had read of; and so being as curious as the French expedition itself, I approached you for details.
('38', 230, 5, 15, 479888) You kindly answered my query personally, saying that you thought the article made it sufficiently clear that it was a purely imaginary account.
('38', 230, 6, 16, 480032) Thereafter in 1925, at a meeting with the Christian missionaries in Calcutta you said: I am not able to say that here in this fair land ...
('38', 230, 6, 17, 480172) 2 man is vile.
('38', 230, 6, 18, 480187) He is not vile.
('38', 230, 6, 19, 480203) He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so.
('38', 230, 6, 20, 480274) This reminds me of a French book translated for me by a French friend.
('38', 230, 6, 21, 480345) It is an account of an imaginary expedition in search of knowledge.
('38', 230, 6, 22, 480413) One party landed in India and found Truth and God personified in a little pariahs hut (Young India, 6 8 1925, p.
('38', 230, 7, 23, 480526) Now, if you are not going to deal with the topic in the further reminiscences of your life, I should be obliged if you could tell us through Young India (or communicate to me personally) the names of the book and its
('38', 230, 8, 24, 480743) author, and say who translated it for you, and when and where.
('38', 230, 8, 25, 480806) Is the translation published and available?
('38', 230, 8, 26, 480850) I wish to ascertain whether the book is one of the two referred to in Yule and Burnells Hobon Jobson (s.

('38', 231, 2, 4, 481393) (There is no question , of course, of my agreeing with the English crities judgment of the French authors).
('38', 231, 2, 5, 481501) I wish I could give Mr. Nadkarni the full information he wants.
('38', 231, 2, 6, 481565) I forget the name of the story.
('38', 231, 2, 7, 481597) The book was specially translated for me by an Anglo French friend when he was staying with me at Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg about 1910. I had intended to pubnlish it but my treasure of books has suffered the same fate as my other treasures.
('38', 231, 2, 8, 481843) I lost many valuable books and manuscripts during transit in 1915 and this precious translation was among them.
('38', 231, 2, 9, 481955) But some of my readers will probably give the information Mr. Nadkarni desires.
('38', 231, 2, 10, 482035) I have a recollection that the gifted author of the book makes his otherwise admirable story end in a girl of the pariah home marrying a Charistian, as if the home where his scientists found knowledge was not complete without a love affair and without a marriage that must tear the girl away from her surroundings and make her less useful for the service of her neighbours.

('38', 231, 6, 14, 482494) QUESTION: Comrade Saklatvala has asked you to be the leader of Trade Union movement in India.
('38', 231, 6, 15, 482588) What is your answer to that call?
('38', 231, 7, 16, 482622) ANSWER : I do not consider that I am qualified for leadership.
('38', 231, 8, 17, 482685) But Mr. Saklatvala says that you are the best qualified man for the work.
('38', 231, 8, 18, 482759) It flatters my pride but it does not convince me.
('38', 231, 9, 19, 482809) How do you say that the Government is weakened by your Bardoli decision?
('38', 231, 10, 20, 482882) Had I continued the campaign, Bardoli people would have been done, and our cause would have suffered.
('38', 231, 10, 21, 482984) There would have been much more tension than there is today.
('38', 231, 10, 22, 483045) The fact is that the people were not prepared for non violence and the campaign would have ended in a widespread terrorism.

('38', 232, 1, 3, 483297) They dread nothing so much as non co operation.
('38', 232, 1, 4, 483345) They know how to deal with a violent outbreak but they dont know how to deal with non violence and non co operation.
('38', 232, 1, 5, 483462) The Bardoli decision was an orderly and deliberate withdrawal, not a panicky rout.
('38', 232, 1, 6, 483545) The weakening of Government prestige that had taken place at the time of the so called ultimatum, still continues.
('38', 232, 1, 7, 483660) It is open to us to undertake a forward movement at any time we choose.
('38', 232, 1, 8, 483732) The awe of the Government is gone for ever.
('38', 232, 2, 9, 483776) The general consensus of opinion is that your reply to Comrade Saklatvala ought to have been a little more detailed.
('38', 232, 2, 10, 483893) Do you propose giving him any more reply?
('38', 232, 2, 11, 483935) In my opinion I have given a sufficient reply.
('38', 232, 2, 12, 483982) I could not treat each and every subject in detail.
('38', 232, 2, 13, 484034) If there is any obscurity about my reply I should be prepared to remove it.
('38', 232, 3, 14, 484110) You have said in your reply that you have your own independent ways of organizing labour.
('38', 232, 3, 15, 484200) Can you explain that viewpoint a little further?
('38', 232, 3, 16, 484249) Yes, I should organize labour by efforts from within.
('38', 232, 3, 17, 484303) It is not so much discontent with capital that I want to inculcate as discontent with themselves.
('38', 232, 3, 18, 484401) I want real co operation between labour and capital.
('38', 232, 3, 19, 484454) I shall convince the labourers that in many things they are to blame themselves instead of blaming the capitalists.
('38', 232, 3, 20, 484570) As in the political so in the labour movement, I rely upon internal reform, i.e., self purifica tion.
('38', 232, 3, 21, 484672) Such reform will command equitable treatment from employers.
('38', 232, 3, 22, 484733) Throughout my experience both in South Africa and India, I have always laid the greatest stress on the principle that labourers must evolve strength from within.
('38', 232, 3, 23, 484895) Then capital will become a real servant of labour.
('38', 232, 3, 24, 484946) I seek to achieve co operation between capital and labour, in the same way as I seek to bring co operation between India and England .
('38', 232, 4, 25, 485081) Regarding the Muslim proposal for joint electorate, Mahatma Gandhi said that the joint electorate was a happy sign and augured well.
('38', 232, 4, 26, 485214) He was not willing to hazard any detailed opinion before considering the question in all its aspects.
('38', 232, 4, 27, 485316) He said the proposed All India Convention should finally settle the matter.
('38', 232, 4, 28, 485392) [Q:] Do you intend visiting any foreign country in the near future?
('38', 232, 4, 29, 485460) [A:] I have no such intention at the present moment.
('38', 232, 5, 30, 485513) But what about China?

('38', 233, 1, 2, 485734) It is very difficult to say.
('38', 233, 1, 3, 485763) In fact, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji had been trying his best to enlist the sympathy of those pilgrims and sadhus for khaddar propaganda.
('38', 233, 1, 4, 485903) He is more in tough with them than I am.
('38', 233, 1, 5, 485944) He is staying at Hardwar for 10 days during the mela and he will be doing all he can to interest the sadhus in the khaddar movement.
('38', 233, 1, 6, 486077) Would you arrange more conferences with them to secure their services for khaddar and prohibition work and also for the removal of untouchability?
('38', 233, 1, 7, 486224) Of course, the sadhus can do a lot in all those things but at present I have no idea whether I shall arrange any special conferences with them.
('38', 233, 1, 8, 486368) Pandit Malaviyaji has taken the initiative in the matter and he will exercise greater influence on them than I can.
('38', 233, 1, 9, 486484) What specific methods of propaganda would you suggest to hasten prohibition in India?
('38', 233, 1, 10, 486570) What do you think of renewing peaceful picketing with proper safeguards?
('38', 233, 1, 11, 486643) If picketing with proper safeguards is possible I shall welcome it at any moment but I do not know whether it can be renewed at pre sent.
('38', 233, 1, 12, 486781) Picketing requires an atmosphere of peacefulness but the ques tion is whether that kind of atmosphere really exists in the country.
('38', 233, 1, 13, 486913) I am personally ready to start picketing the moment I acquire confidence in a peaceful atmosphere, which I dont possess at present.

('38', 233, 4, 17, 487146) Accompanied by Sir Chunilal Metha, the Finance Member to the Government of Bombay, and Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel of Ahmedabad, Gandhiji paid a visit to the Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khata at Ghatkopar on Thursday morning.
('38', 233, 4, 18, 487358) After Gandhiji was shown round the stables of the institution and the cattle, .
('38', 233, 4, 19, 487438) the Secretary of the institution .
('38', 233, 4, 20, 487473) accorded a sincere welcome.
('38', 233, 5, 21, 487501) [Replying,] .
('38', 233, 5, 22, 487515) Gandhiji expressed his immense pleasure and congratulated the Committee for the Jivadaya Khata.
('38', 233, 5, 23, 487611) Since he undertook the cow protection work at Belgaum in 1925, he had longed to pay a visit to the institution, but he had not been able to do so because of his preoccupations.
('38', 233, 5, 24, 487788) His tour in 1925 had given him many opportunities to study the subject of the protection of milch

('38', 234, 1, 2, 488054) cattle in India and he had come to the conclusion that slaughter of milch cattle could not be effectively prevented unless those who wanted to do so took to hide industry.
('38', 234, 1, 3, 488226) The question of industry was very important in view of the fact that hides worth about nine crores were exported from India every year.
('38', 234, 1, 4, 488362) It was not a sin even for Hindus to trade in hides and Gandhiji hoped to find a tannery in the Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khata when he visited it next.
('38', 234, 1, 5, 488508) Concluding, Gandhiji advised the Committee of the institution to give up breeding buffaloes and concentrate all their resources on breeding cows.
('38', 234, 1, 6, 488654) Mahatmaji said that if he were Governor of Bombay he would have those stables removed to a distance of 20 miles and given not 10 but thousands of acres of land with ample grass meadows.
('38', 234, 1, 7, 488840) He argued the establishment of a leather factory attached to the association stables in order to run an institution on economic lines.
('38', 234, 1, 8, 488975) The association should also link itself to agricultural institutions so that the manure might be utilized most profitably.

('38', 234, 7, 16, 489616) The little boys of the school had all been waiting in the sun with the hand some purse they had collected and they had the lesson of fearlessness from Gandhijis lips: Fearlessness is the foundation of all education, the beginning and not the end.
('38', 234, 7, 17, 489863) If you do not build on that foundation, the edifice of all your education will topple over.

('38', 235, 3, 4, 490419) At Negala, Mahatmaji was given a cordial welcome by the Christian community.
('38', 235, 3, 5, 490496) The Principal of the Girls Christian High School in his welcome address assured Mahatmaji that the Christian community was one with him in all his activities.
('38', 235, 3, 6, 490655) In his reply, Mahatmaji said: 2
('38', 235, 4, 7, 490687) My experience tells me that the Kingdom of God is within us, and that we can realize it not by saying Lord, Lord, but by doing His will and His work.
('38', 235, 4, 8, 490837) If therefore we wait for the Kingdom to come as something coming from outside, we shall be sadly mistaken.
('38', 235, 4, 9, 490944) I am glad you are with me in my programme.
('38', 235, 4, 10, 490987) I may assure you then that whatever I do is done with the object of that realization.
('38', 235, 4, 11, 491073) Untouch ability, you say, you would like to see removed as much as I. Well, then, I may tell you that you cannot remove untouchability without whole heartedly taking up khadi work, for that work includes removal of untouchability, and goes beyond it.
('38', 235, 4, 12, 491324) Do you know that there are thousands of villages where people are starving and which are on the brink of ruin?
('38', 235, 4, 13, 491435) If we would listen to the voice of God, I assure you we would hear Him say that we are taking His name in vain if we do not think of the poor and help them.
('38', 235, 4, 14, 491592) Mr. Sam Higginbottom, a Christian missionary friend, came to see me the other day to discuss this very thing.
('38', 235, 4, 15, 491702) Fortunately he met me just in that area where the spinning wheel and khadi had done their work.
('38', 235, 4, 16, 491798) I ask you to go and visit such parts, and if you cannot do so, to take my word for it, that there is no better subsidiary occupation for the poor than khadi.
('38', 235, 4, 17, 491956) If you cannot render the little help that they need, it is no use talking of service of God and service of the poor.
('38', 235, 4, 18, 492073) Please go to the exhibition 3 and see things for yourselves, and try to identify yourselves with the poor by actually helping them.

('38', 236, 3, 5, 492545) Gandhiji asked him if there was anything like a ban on khadi in Kolhapur State.
('38', 236, 3, 6, 492625) There may have been something like it, he said, but there was nothing now.
('38', 236, 3, 7, 492700) Have I your permission then to say to the people at the public meeting in your name that people may go to the palace and all State offices and attend functions dressed in khadi?
('38', 236, 4, 8, 492878) The Diwan had no objection, and Gandhiji declared the thing at the public meeting and thanked him for the assurance.
('38', 236, 4, 9, 492995) He said: Do not have any illusion about khadi.
('38', 236, 4, 10, 493042) It is not that khadi invests the wearer with any sort of saintliness.
('38', 236, 4, 11, 493112) It is the duty of everyone who has the good of the poor at heart to wear it.
('38', 236, 4, 12, 493189) Even an adulterer and a prostitute may wear it.
('38', 236, 4, 13, 493237) This is how I would approach them.
('38', 236, 4, 14, 493272) As to our conduct, I would say to them, you are answerable to God.
('38', 236, 4, 15, 493339) But whe ther you are able to mend your ways or no, you can certainly wear khadi and do some service to the poor.
('38', 236, 4, 16, 493452) He who wastes money on liquor is a sinner.
('38', 236, 4, 17, 493495) He who wastes money on tobacco is a smaller sinner, if you will.
('38', 236, 4, 18, 493560) The one who wastes money on foreign cloth is as great a sinner as the second if not the first, and the one who uses Indian mill cloth has neither virtue nor vice to his credit or debit.
('38', 236, 4, 19, 493746) But the khadi wearer has distinctly something to his credit inasmuch as he serves both the poor and his country.
('38', 236, 4, 20, 493859) Khadi immediately takes him up from a lower level and makes him the friend of the poor. Young India, 31 3 1927

('38', 236, 7, 24, 494068) I was wondering why there was nothing from you so long.
('38', 236, 7, 25, 494124) Now I know.
('38', 236, 7, 26, 494136) It distresses me to find you in such a dilapidated condition.
('38', 236, 7, 27, 494198) I am writing this in the midst of distractions.
('38', 236, 7, 28, 494246) I have not a moment to spare.

('38', 237, 1, 3, 494512) I am in the South in April.
('38', 237, 1, 4, 494540) I must make a desperate effort to meet you during the tour.
('38', 237, 1, 5, 494600) When Maria returns I must see what can be done for spinning.

('38', 237, 5, 12, 494812) [March 26, 1927] 2
('38', 237, 6, 13, 494831) That is an instance where the doctors fortunately succeeded in prevailing upon Gandhiji.
('38', 237, 6, 14, 494920) There have been instances in which they have failed.
('38', 237, 6, 15, 494973) For Gandhiji, who in many respects is an ideal patient, as many doctors have certified, also at times becomes the despair of his doctors.
('38', 237, 6, 16, 495111) The doctor immediately after the collapse prescribed undis turbed bodily rest, including cessation from spinning.
('38', 237, 7, 17, 495225) Well, then, take my blood pressure, before spinning and after spinning, and if you can convince me that after spinning it hasgone up to an alarming extent, I shall accept your advice.
('38', 237, 7, 18, 495409) On the contrary, I assure you spinning is a positive relaxation, it soothes the nerves.
('38', 237, 7, 19, 495497) And then, doctor, you must know that mine is a code of life far different from yours.
('38', 237, 7, 20, 495583) For instance, you would prescribe all sorts of medicines.
('38', 237, 7, 21, 495641) Now I have laid down a course of life, which, in certain respects, I may not change.
('38', 237, 7, 22, 495726) So if you give me a medicine which is composed of five ingredients I would take it, provided you agree to my forgoing my meal which may under no circumstances exceed five articles a day.
('38', 237, 7, 23, 495913) So you must either convince me that the medicine is more essential for my health than the diet, or must reconcile yourself to administering no medicine.
('38', 237, 7, 24, 496066) Then there is another thing.
('38', 237, 7, 25, 496095) Spinning is a thing l cannot live without.
('38', 237, 7, 26, 496138) If I must eat and live I must spin.
('38', 237, 7, 27, 496174) And what a glorious death it would be if you came and found me spinning and collapsing in the midst of it.
('38', 237, 7, 28, 496281) You would abuse those about me to your hearts content, if you insisted on your discipline as a doctor, but if you are

('38', 238, 1, 3, 496662) You must know that I would be conscience stricken and make myself most miserable if I continued to live on and was not able to spin.
('38', 238, 1, 4, 496795) Yes, I may stop reading, writing and even spinning, provided I stop feeding too.
('38', 238, 1, 5, 496876) Will you permit me that?
('38', 238, 1, 6, 496901) No, doctor, I may not implicitly obey you, unless you can claim infallibility.
('38', 238, 2, 7, 496980) If we could claim it, rejoined the doctor with justice, we should not be administering drugs, but be oracles sitting in temples.
('38', 238, 3, 8, 497109) No wonder Dr. Wanless frankly said that no treatment was necessary excepting rest for an indefinite period.

('38', 238, 6, 12, 497304) DEAR SATIS BABU,
('38', 238, 7, 13, 497321) Well, it is not much use inquiring about you now that I am myself in the mire.
('38', 238, 7, 14, 497400) I am trying to pull myself out.
('38', 238, 7, 15, 497432) But if God wills otherwise what is my trial worth?
('38', 238, 7, 16, 497483) Anyway I do not expect to go beyond 13th April, 1928. I have nothing new to say or give.
('38', 238, 7, 17, 497572) I may collect more, give a little more guidance and patch here and patch there.
('38', 238, 7, 18, 497652) But really the clock has struck for me.
('38', 238, 7, 19, 497692) To reduce the message to execution is left for you.
('38', 238, 7, 20, 497744) You have therefore to live and work.
('38', 238, 7, 21, 497781) If I survive I shall not be of much use for active work evidently.
('38', 238, 7, 22, 497848) Let us see: Thy will be done, not ours, oh Lord! What is the use then even of peeping into the future?
('38', 238, 7, 23, 497951) Just for the moment I appear to be as fit as a fiddle.
('38', 238, 7, 24, 498006) And so I amuse myself by sending love messages to friends I can think of and have no time to talk to.

('38', 239, 3, 7, 498496) How far have you progressed in Sanskrit?
('38', 239, 3, 8, 498537) And would you now be ranked first in carding and spinning?

('38', 239, 3, 11, 498638) I am improving every day.

('38', 239, 7, 16, 498796) I hope that Gujaratis will heartily respond to the appeal made by Shri Vallabhbhai Patel on behalf of the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee in connection with the National Week.
('38', 239, 7, 17, 498978) One can say that collecting a sum of Rs. 1 lakh is childs play for Gujarat.
('38', 239, 7, 18, 499054) This amo unt, moreover, is required for work among the suppressed classes, which include Antyajas and the Raniparaj community.
('38', 239, 7, 19, 499181) From now on, we will describe Antyajas too as dalit.
('38', 239, 7, 20, 499234) The term was first used by Swami Shraddhanand.
('38', 239, 7, 21, 499281) Swami Vivekananda chose an English word having the same meaning.
('38', 239, 7, 22, 499346) He described the untouchables not as depressed 2 but as suppressed 3 and quite rightly.
('38', 239, 7, 23, 499434) They became, and remain, what they are because they were suppressed by the so called upper classes.
('38', 239, 7, 24, 499534) The Hindi word for this is dalit.
('38', 239, 7, 25, 499568) Among all the suppressed classes, the untouchables are the most suppressed.
('38', 239, 7, 26, 499644) The Rani (Kali) paraj community is also suppressed, and so are other communities, like Oghra, etc..
('38', 239, 7, 27, 499744) It is the object of the Provincial Com mittee to serve all these communities to the best of its resources.

('38', 240, 1, 3, 500148) I hope, therefore, that everyone will enthu siastically respond to this appeal and the sum of one lakh will be collected in no time, and also that honest people will come forward and enroll themselves immediately as volunteers for this work.

('38', 240, 6, 11, 500905) 231. CONDITIONS OF COW PROTECTION2
('38', 240, 7, 12, 500940) It has been a matter of sorrow for me to have taken up the burden of cow protection during the ending years of my life.
('38', 240, 7, 13, 501060) But there need be no sorrow when burdens come not of ones seeking but when they seek one irresistibly.
('38', 240, 7, 14, 501163) And so has been for me the case with cow protection.
('38', 240, 7, 15, 501216) Recently at Ghatkopar, Bombay, I had the occasion to visit the institution 3 of the humanitarian society ably managed by its secretary Sjt.
('38', 240, 7, 16, 501356) Nagindas.
('38', 240, 7, 17, 501366) It is now conducting an experiment in dairying with the laudable object ultimately of replacing the illmanaged and disease breeding private dairies of Bombay which are situated in the heart of the city and where there is no exercise ground for the cattle, and where the best cattle are prematurely given to the butchers knife.
('38', 240, 8, 18, 501693) 1 Not translated here 2 This was written on or before March 28, 1927; vide Letter to Maganlal Gandhi, 28 3 1927. 3 Vide Speech at Sarvajanik Jivadaya Khata, Ghatkopar, 24 3 1927.
('38', 241, 0, 1, 501872) 242 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 241, 1, 2, 501914) But though the institution is ably managed, it has some inherent defects to which upon its invitation I had to draw the Societys atten tion.
('38', 241, 1, 3, 502055) Incidentally I ventured to lay down the conditions of cow pro tection which are well worth repeating: 1. Every such institution should be situated out in the open where it is possible to have plenty, i.e., thousands of acres, of open ground capable of growing fodder and giving exercise to the cattle.
('38', 241, 1, 4, 502357) If I had the management of all the goshalas, I should sell the majority of the present ones at handsome profits and buy suitable plots in the vicinity except where the existing places may be needed for mere receiving depots.
('38', 241, 1, 5, 502582) 2. Every goshala should be turned into a model dairy and a model tannery.
('38', 241, 1, 6, 502656) Every single head of dead cattle should be retained and scientifically treated and the hide, bones, entrails, etc., should be used to the best advantage.
('38', 241, 1, 7, 502810) I should regard the hide of dead cattle to be sacred and usable as distinguished from the hide and other parts of slaughtered cattle, which should be deemed to be unfit for human use or at least for Hindu use.
('38', 241, 1, 8, 503020) 3. Urine and dung in many goshalas are thrown away.
('38', 241, 1, 9, 503072) This I regard as criminal waste.
('38', 241, 1, 10, 503105) 4. All goshalas should he managed under scientific supervision and guidance.
('38', 241, 1, 11, 503182) 5. Properly managed every goshala should be and can be made self supporting, donations being used for its extension.
('38', 241, 1, 12, 503299) The idea is never to make these institutions profit making concerns, all profits being utilized towards buying maimed and disabled cattle and buying in the open market all cattle destined for the slaughterhouse.
('38', 241, 1, 13, 503511) 6. This consummation is impossible if the goshalas take in buffaloes, goats, etc.
('38', 241, 1, 14, 503593) So far as I can see, much as I would like it to be otherwise.
('38', 241, 1, 15, 503655) not until the whole of India becomes vegetarian, can goats and sheep be saved from the butchers knife.
('38', 241, 1, 16, 503758) Buffaloes can be saved if we will not insist upon buffalos milk and religiously avoid it in preference to cows milk.
('38', 241, 1, 17, 503875) In Bombay on the other hand, the practice is to take bufffalos milk instead of cows milk.
('38', 241, 1, 18, 503965) Physicians unani mously declare that cows milk is medically superior to buffalos milk and it is the opinion of dairy experts that cows milk can by judicious management be made much richer than it is at present found to be.
('38', 241, 1, 19, 504188) I hold that it is impossible to save both the buffalo and the cow.
('38', 241, 1, 20, 504255) The cow can be saved only if buffalo breeding is given up.
('38', 242, 0, 1, 504314) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 243
('38', 242, 1, 2, 504357) The buffalo cannot be used for agricultural purposes on a wide scale.
('38', 242, 1, 3, 504427) It is just possible to save the existing stock, if we will cease to breed it any further.
('38', 242, 1, 4, 504517) It is no part of religion to breed buffaloes or for that matter cows.
('38', 242, 1, 5, 504587) We breed for our own uses.
('38', 242, 1, 6, 504614) It is cruelty to the cow as well as to the buffalo to breed the latter.
('38', 242, 1, 7, 504686) Humanitarians should know that Hindu shepherds even at the present moment mercilessly kill young male buffaloes as they cannot profitably feed them.
('38', 242, 1, 8, 504835) To save the cow and her progenyand that only is a feasible propositionthe Hindus will forgo profits from the trade concerning the cow and her products, but never otherwise.
('38', 242, 1, 9, 505008) Religion to be true must satisfy what may be termed humanitarian economics, i.e., where the income and the expenditure balance each other.
('38', 242, 1, 10, 505147) The attainment of such economies is just possible with the cow and the cow only with the assistance of donations for some years from pious Hindus.
('38', 242, 1, 11, 505294) It should be remembered that this great humanitarian attempt is being made in the face of a beef eating world.
('38', 242, 1, 12, 505405) Not till the whole world turns predomi nantly vegetarian is it possible to make any advance upon the limita tions I have sought to describe.
('38', 242, 1, 13, 505546) To succeed to that extent is to open the way, for future generations, to further efforts.
('38', 242, 1, 14, 505636) To overstep the limitation is to consign the cow for ever to the slaughter house in addition to the buffalo and the other animals.
('38', 242, 1, 15, 505767) Hindus and the humanitarian societies in charge of goshalas and pinjrapoles, if they are wisely religious, will bear the foregoing condi tions of cow protection in mind and proceed immediately to give effect to them.

('38', 243, 7, 13, 507113) Do we not ourselves live there?

('38', 244, 1, 12, 509000) Today it is just an illness, tomorrow there may be death.
('38', 244, 1, 13, 509058) Why think about it?

('38', 245, 2, 3, 509401) NIPANI, Silence Day [March 28, 1927]
('38', 245, 3, 4, 509438) DEAR SISTERS,
('38', 245, 4, 5, 509452) Do not worry if I tell you that I have been ill.
('38', 245, 4, 6, 509501) Today it is only a small illness.
('38', 245, 4, 7, 509535) In a few years life itself will pass away.
('38', 245, 4, 8, 509578) But what does it matter?
('38', 245, 4, 9, 509603) The Gita clearly teaches us and we too see daily ourselves that those who are born die and those who die are born again.
('38', 245, 4, 10, 509724) Everyone repays his debt more or less and passes away.
('38', 245, 4, 11, 509779) I dont say this lightly, but quite seriously.
('38', 245, 4, 12, 509825) If it were not for human passion there will be no disease.
('38', 245, 4, 13, 509884) A person who has no passion has also to die.
('38', 245, 4, 14, 509929) But he drops gently down like a ripe fruit.
('38', 245, 4, 15, 509973) I hope and pray that I should drop like that.
('38', 245, 4, 16, 510019) I ever have this hope and wish.
('38', 245, 4, 17, 510051) But who knows?
('38', 245, 4, 18, 510066) Passions I still have and they play their part.
('38', 245, 4, 19, 510114) The state of complete freedom from passion can be realized only through perso nal experience.
('38', 245, 4, 20, 510208) Devote yourselves entirely to your duties.
('38', 245, 4, 21, 510251) Youth is given to us to conquer passions.
('38', 245, 4, 22, 510293) We should not allow it to pass away fruitless.
('38', 245, 4, 23, 510340) Safeguard your purity.
('38', 245, 4, 24, 510363) Do not give up the spinning wheel.

('38', 246, 9, 15, 511511) Well, I had my own illusions and I over worked myself, for which God has laid me low.
('38', 246, 9, 16, 511597) But what had you been kicking against?

('38', 247, 11, 21, 512967) You did not think of your earlier resolves; did not consider the earlier letter nor did you wait for Maganlal to come.
('38', 247, 11, 22, 513086) I have letters from all the teachers.
('38', 247, 11, 23, 513124) Much of what I have said to you applies to them as well.
('38', 247, 11, 24, 513181) I shall accept whatever you decide after consulting Maganlal.
('38', 247, 11, 25, 513243) Dont let my illness come in the way.
('38', 247, 11, 26, 513280) Make no tentative decision.
('38', 247, 11, 27, 513308) There should be no violence if you reach a decision on merits.
('38', 247, 11, 28, 513371) Regard the Ashram and the school as belonging to you all and do what you please without taking my presence into account.
('38', 247, 11, 29, 513492) Dont worry on my account.
('38', 247, 11, 30, 513518) You can all be regarded as wise, so I do not have to cheer you up.

('38', 247, 11, 32, 513627) Let that too come by the 13th of April, 1928. This interval is not too short for the attainment of swaraj in my lifetime.

('38', 251, 3, 6, 518658) Sooner or later that will happen.
('38', 251, 3, 7, 518692) Why need we fear it?
('38', 251, 3, 8, 518713) Remain engrossed in your work.
('38', 251, 3, 9, 518744) It will be enough if we ceaselessly strive to reach what we believe to be our ideal and do not give it up even if we break in the effort.
('38', 251, 3, 10, 518882) I am being looked after quite well.
('38', 251, 3, 11, 518918) You need not therefore worry on that account.
('38', 251, 3, 12, 518964) It is not yet decided where I should stay and what regimen I should follow.
('38', 251, 3, 13, 519040) It will be in a day or two.
('38', 251, 3, 14, 519068) If Shankerlal arrives there he will read this, other wise send the letter wherever he is.
('38', 251, 3, 15, 519158) Worrying will not help in the least.

('38', 251, 7, 20, 519309) DEAR FRIEND, My answer to your letter is yes.
('38', 251, 7, 21, 519355) It means the discovery of Gods laws.
('38', 251, 7, 22, 519392) God has laid me low for the moment.
('38', 251, 7, 23, 519428) 2 But He is infinitely merciful.
('38', 251, 7, 24, 519461) My apologies to Mrs. Jones.

('38', 252, 3, 5, 519954) I hope you have arrived safe.
('38', 252, 3, 6, 519984) I had sent a radio set for you, but before it could reach you your steamer had left the wharf.
('38', 252, 3, 7, 520079) I had it sent within the time fixed by you.
('38', 252, 3, 8, 520123) One who has failed to keep ones word should become more resolute.
('38', 252, 3, 9, 520189) You could not keep your promise, so now you have resolved not to make any.
('38', 252, 3, 10, 520264) Remember this is not the way to rise; it only leads to ones fall.

('38', 252, 11, 28, 521238) Doctors ascribe it to overwork, nervous exhaustion and advise complete rest, cancellation all programmes, hot months at any rate.

('38', 253, 8, 13, 521871) HIGH PRIEST OF THE LOWLY, My health has tied me down to the bed; yesterday therefore I could go through your [draft] speech from one end to the other.
('38', 253, 8, 14, 522022) A person like me could learn a little from it but it is my humble opinion that as a presidential address it will not do.
('38', 253, 8, 15, 522143) I do not write this in exercise of any right of veto that you have conferred on me.
('38', 253, 8, 16, 522227) I am only arguing with you as a friend.
('38', 253, 8, 17, 522267) The speech gives no evidence of a sense of proportion.
('38', 253, 8, 18, 522322) We seem to have lost it.
('38', 253, 8, 19, 522347) Another reason is that it violates the implicit under standing with the Rana Saheb.
('38', 253, 8, 20, 522431) A third reason is that the speech does not suit the kind of audience we are going to muster.
('38', 253, 8, 21, 522524) I say there is no sense of proportion because this speech does not take into account the past convention.
('38', 253, 8, 22, 522630) There is a breach of our implicit understanding with the Rana Saheb that there should be no personal criticism, etc.
('38', 253, 8, 23, 522747) And the speech will be neither appreciated nor read by the sections whom we are at the moment trying to rouse.
('38', 253, 8, 24, 522858) If you follow Gullivers Travels and conceive an imaginary country in which to apply your correctives, you could say all that you have said; or if you emulate Aesop you could have a bird of your choice

('38', 254, 1, 2, 523102) perched on every tree in Saurashtra to expound your doctrines through their chatter.
('38', 254, 1, 3, 523187) And then you could have instructed us while you amused us.
('38', 254, 1, 4, 523246) Or like Vyasa you may create sub human and super human characters, reject the past, compile a history of mankind and then give us a miniature Mahabharata of Saurashtra.
('38', 254, 1, 5, 523415) We needs must train a new class of audience for the speech that you have drafted or that has been drafted for you.
('38', 254, 1, 6, 523530) Our first task therefore will be to annul the constitution adopted at Bhavnagar.
('38', 254, 1, 7, 523611) I may perhaps agree to this.
('38', 254, 1, 8, 523640) And then we should call a conference of such select people as would be competent to appreciate and also act upon the thoughts contained in your speech.
('38', 254, 1, 9, 523792) We should place before them your suggestions and have them implemented.
('38', 254, 1, 10, 523864) I would therefore make the following suggestions: You should call a small committee and place your ideas before them.
('38', 254, 1, 11, 523982) You may then lay the foundation of your speech as was the practice followed by the Congress in the past.
('38', 254, 1, 12, 524087) Speeches by Wedderburn, Webb, Bradlaugh and others used to be placed before Pherozeshah, Gokhale and others for approval.
('38', 254, 1, 13, 524209) In this way a tradition was maintained.
('38', 254, 1, 14, 524249) This state of affairs, I know, came down to the times of Sinha.
('38', 254, 1, 15, 524313) Your speech belongs to that tradition.
('38', 254, 1, 16, 524352) I do not suggest that it is of no use; we want a new society to make use of it.
('38', 254, 1, 17, 524432) You cannot address such speeches to peasants.
('38', 254, 1, 18, 524478) Whatever happens to me the Conference must be held in June.
('38', 254, 1, 19, 524538) I suggest that at the same time we should decide upon the constitution of the Conference and first put our own house in order.
('38', 254, 1, 20, 524665) And then start immediately a new era by convening the newly constituted Con ference.
('38', 254, 1, 21, 524750) But I cannot explain all this in a letter.
('38', 254, 1, 22, 524793) I think there is no sense in discussing individual points when I am recommending a radical revision of your draft.
('38', 254, 1, 23, 524908) Though of course I write this, at the moment I am so weak I cannot invite any one of you to come here soon.
('38', 254, 1, 24, 525016) You should there fore confer with Devchandbhai, Fulchand and Amritlal and do whatever you have to.
('38', 254, 1, 25, 525115) I would also invite Patwari, Pattani Saheb and Shukla Saheb to this meeting.
('38', 254, 1, 26, 525192) I would acquaint myself with every ones opinion and do what appears good for us.
('38', 254, 1, 27, 525273) But then that is how I think.
('38', 254, 1, 28, 525303) If you go ahead you should also obtain Vallabhbhais advice.
('38', 254, 1, 29, 525363) Whatever you do let it be based on solid foundations.

('38', 255, 6, 9, 525750) April 3, 1927 3
('38', 255, 7, 10, 525766) GANDHIJI: How long may I accept the hospitality of a Chief 4 who has been kindness itself ?
('38', 255, 7, 11, 525858) And apart from the climate, I can be as restful at Sabarmati as at any other place.
('38', 255, 7, 12, 525942) It is not the heat that matters, though I am confident of dodging even that heat by various devices.
('38', 255, 7, 13, 526043) And if we are to identify ourselves with the poor, surely we should understand that a vast mass of our people live and work and toil in excessive heat of the sun, and never think of going for a change when an illness overtakes them.
('38', 255, 8, 14, 526276) The argument is unanswerable though the doctor who concerns himself mainly
('38', 255, 9, 15, 526351) with physiological considerations may brush it aside.
('38', 255, 9, 16, 526405) But Gandhiji has had always
('38', 255, 10, 17, 526433) the good fortune of having as his friends doctors who, at least so far as he is
('38', 255, 11, 18, 526513) concerned, are prepared to consult not merely the needs of his body, but the needs of
('38', 255, 12, 19, 526599) his soul, and try to suit their advice as regards keeping of the body to his mental and
('38', 255, 13, 20, 526687) spiritual predilections.
('38', 255, 14, 21, 526712) GANDHIJI: If then I am merely to vegetate, I must be content to recuperate in my own place.
('38', 255, 15, 22, 526804) MEHTA: But you will not vegetate.
('38', 255, 15, 23, 526838) Your rest is work itself, for it will set
('38', 255, 16, 24, 526880) you up and make the body stand another spell of strain.
('38', 255, 16, 25, 526936) But that rest I can have at Sabarmati.
('38', 255, 17, 26, 526975) Yes, you may have it, and yet the heat might affect the blood pressure, and retard recovery.

('38', 255, 18, 28, 527088) The letter was apparently written in Belgium but Amboli address was given at the top for the addressees benefit.

('38', 256, 7, 17, 528516) Twelve hours continuous plying of the charkha, said I. That was
('38', 256, 8, 18, 528580) far from satisfying him.
('38', 256, 8, 19, 528605) He said: Twelve hours is all right, I shall also contribute my hour.
('38', 256, 8, 20, 528674) But you must go to Savantwadi and hawk khadi there during the week, you must try to go to the untouchables quarters, inquire about their welfare, see if they have schools, wells, etc.
('38', 256, 8, 21, 528858) Even when Devdas and you go to Savantwadi, I shall see that the wheel is kept turning.

('38', 256, 11, 25, 529123) Writing love letters is a recreation, not a task one would seek an excuse to shirk.

('38', 257, 1, 2, 529332) Dr. Mehta came all the way from Bombay to examine the body.
('38', 257, 1, 3, 529392) He is emphatically of opinion that all touring should be given up for some months to come.
('38', 257, 1, 4, 529483) He does not forbid reading in the bed or even occasional letters to friends.
('38', 257, 1, 5, 529560) If I take full rest he thinks that I would regain most of the lost strength but never be strong enough to undertake the exacting tours such as the one that came to an abrupt end on the 25th ultimo.
('38', 257, 1, 6, 529758) We shall see.
('38', 257, 1, 7, 529772) If the tour is finally cancelled, I must take my rest at the Ashram.
('38', 257, 1, 8, 529841) I shall come to a decision today or tomorrow.
('38', 257, 1, 9, 529887) The probability is that it will be cancelled.
('38', 257, 1, 10, 529933) Even so I shall not move out before Tuesday next week.
('38', 257, 1, 11, 529988) But why are you having these attacks?
('38', 257, 1, 12, 530026) 1 Is it mere spiritual agony or has the climate also anything to do with it?
('38', 257, 1, 13, 530103) If you need a bracing climate you must move out.
('38', 257, 1, 14, 530152) How do you find the climate there?
('38', 257, 1, 15, 530187) It was quite right not to have gone to Bharatpur.

('38', 257, 6, 21, 530426) MAGANLAL, I am eager to know Sir Gangarams experience of farming.
('38', 257, 6, 22, 530492) I like your co operation with the teachers, but only if it is sincere and spontaneous.
('38', 257, 6, 23, 530579) If it has come about owing to my illness there will again be some snags.
('38', 257, 6, 24, 530652) I yearn for such involuntary co ordi nation as there is between one eye and the other.
('38', 257, 6, 25, 530739) This is possible only if we look upon all people as our own.
('38', 257, 6, 26, 530800) Experience tells us that a team of good men is better than a mere conglomeration of good results.
('38', 257, 6, 27, 530898) Disinterested action consists in the faith that everything will ultimately lead to good results.

('38', 258, 7, 9, 531568) JANAKIBEHN, Devdas had to leave you but I did not like it.
('38', 258, 7, 10, 531627) I could see, however, he could not help it.
('38', 258, 7, 11, 531671) Maybe now he can return in a few days.
('38', 258, 7, 12, 531710) How are you now?
('38', 258, 7, 13, 531727) Have you been regaining strength?
('38', 258, 7, 14, 531761) Any complaints ?
('38', 258, 7, 15, 531778) Is Chi.
('38', 258, 7, 16, 531786) Kamala studying anything?
('38', 258, 7, 17, 531812) Do not write to me yourself but get Kamala to write to me a long letter.
('38', 258, 7, 18, 531885) None should worry about my health.
('38', 258, 7, 19, 531920) At any rate now I am keeping well.
('38', 258, 7, 20, 531955) The old are on the verge of death, are not they?
('38', 258, 7, 21, 532004) Therefore under this or that pretext they must leave their old abodes and inhabit new ones if they please.
('38', 258, 7, 22, 532111) But if they would rather leave the cage altogether they might soar in the air and enjoy freedom.
('38', 258, 7, 23, 532208) But then our case is similar to that of a prisoner who, owing to his long detention, comes to be attached to his cell.
('38', 258, 7, 24, 532327) We do not wish to give up the body because we identify ourselves with it.
('38', 258, 7, 25, 532401) I do not know what I wish.
('38', 258, 7, 26, 532428) As far as my reason goes I do not find it worth caring for.
('38', 258, 7, 27, 532488) But poor reason is helpless before delusion.
('38', 258, 7, 28, 532533) The truth will be known when the end comes.

('38', 259, 8, 11, 533039) Look here, make the Satyagraha Week 1 a success.
('38', 259, 8, 12, 533088) Those who cannot be interested in the Gita, those who have no ear for the music of the spinning wheel, do not at all understand life.
('38', 259, 8, 13, 533222) Since we ourselves are the fountains of delight, we should know how to derive it from tunes which would bring us felicity.
('38', 259, 8, 14, 533345) Therein lies real art.
('38', 259, 8, 15, 533368) It is servile to seek delight from without; true happiness lies in evoking delight from within.

('38', 260, 7, 10, 534288) MY DEAR FRIEND, This is from a sick bed.
('38', 260, 7, 11, 534329) I had hoped to see you in Bangalore and press my suit.
('38', 260, 7, 12, 534384) But it cannot be for some time yet.
('38', 260, 7, 13, 534420) I have no reply to my wire which I hope you did get.
('38', 260, 7, 14, 534473) You will break the heart of Indians in South Africa if you do not go.
('38', 260, 7, 15, 534543) 1 Mrs. Sastri should certainly go with you.
('38', 260, 7, 16, 534587) 2 I do not know that it is an advantage to have both host and hostess as brilliant talkers in English.
('38', 260, 7, 17, 534690) You will be her interpreter or you can take for her one of the gifted Tamil graduate girls of whom you have so many.
('38', 260, 7, 18, 534807) She will be her companion, teacher and interpreter.
('38', 260, 7, 19, 534859) What did Queen Victoria do when she was hostess to the Shah of Persia who knew no English?
('38', 260, 7, 20, 534950) And you can make it clear to Lord Irwin that you would want to be here when the Royal Commission comes.
('38', 260, 7, 21, 535054) Lastly, there will be no fear of pinpricks whilst Lord Irwin is Viceroy.
('38', 260, 7, 22, 535127) He knows you so well.
('38', 260, 7, 23, 535149) I urge you to reconsider your decision and go even if it is for a year.
('38', 260, 7, 24, 535221) You alone can inaugurate the working of the compact, you alone can set the tone.
('38', 260, 7, 25, 535302) May God guide you.

('38', 261, 1, 2, 535517) 260. LETTER TO S. D. SATAVALEKAR
('38', 261, 2, 3, 535550) AMBOLI, SAVANTWADI STATE, April 6, 1927
('38', 261, 3, 4, 535590) BHAI SATAVALEKAR, I am confined to a sick bed.
('38', 261, 3, 5, 535637) I could therefore easily get the time to read your book on brahmacharya.
('38', 261, 3, 6, 535710) I liked the book.
('38', 261, 3, 7, 535728) For years I have regarded you as a devotee of truth; hence this letter.
('38', 261, 3, 8, 535800) 1. Do you regard the asanas [postures] as an infallible means to brahmacharya?
('38', 261, 3, 9, 535879) 2. If this is true does it not mean that a man who practises asanas retains his vital fluid under all circumstances?
('38', 261, 3, 10, 535996) Does it also mean that such an aspirant becomes free from passion ?
('38', 261, 3, 11, 536064) You are perhaps aware of a certain process in Western medicine by which a man can retain the fluid but is not freed from passion.
('38', 261, 3, 12, 536194) This method is followed by those who propose to enjoy sex without losing the fluid.
('38', 261, 3, 13, 536278) Do our systems mean this thing when they speak of becoming urdhvareta?
('38', 261, 3, 14, 536349) If it were so, the state of the urdhvareta would be detrimental to pure brahmacharya.
('38', 261, 3, 15, 536435) And then there would be a lurking danger of harm in retaining semen with the help of the asanas.
('38', 261, 3, 16, 536532) A friend from Delhi writes to me saying that with the help of asanas he has attained brahmacharya to such an extent that he can take any kind or quantity of food and enjoy almost all pleasures without losing his vital fluid.
('38', 261, 3, 17, 536757) I did not continue further correspondence with him as I was not impressed by his letter.
('38', 261, 3, 18, 536846) Another friend writes to say that with the help of pranayama 1, asanas and the like the final stage of brahmacharya can be attained within six months.
('38', 261, 3, 19, 536997) Him I know.
('38', 261, 3, 20, 537009) He is a simple straightforward man with no guile.
('38', 261, 3, 21, 537059) And he goes on insisting that I should practise asanas and the like.
('38', 261, 3, 22, 537128) I have not yet acted on his advice but your book has moved me.
('38', 261, 3, 23, 537191) I came in contact with many students and I cannot satisfy them all by my own experiments.
('38', 261, 3, 24, 537281) Besides restrictions of diet, etc., all my experiments are purely psychological.
('38', 261, 3, 25, 537362) I write this as it appears to me that a section of the student community has fallen so low that asanas and the like can [alone] be of any help to them.
('38', 261, 4, 26, 537514) 1 Breath control

('38', 262, 1, 2, 537574) 3. Do you have personal experience of what you write about brahmacharya in plants, 1 etc.?
('38', 262, 1, 3, 537665) You would be aware that Western scholars of natural sciences nowadays write against brahmacharya.
('38', 262, 1, 4, 537763) I have refuted their arguments with the help of my little experience and by the exercise of whatever talents I have.
('38', 262, 1, 5, 537880) But it is essential that these Western treatises are examined by our own experts since they greatly influence our young men.
('38', 262, 1, 6, 538005) 4. I have also gone through your book Suryabhedan Vyayam.
('38', 262, 1, 7, 538063) Do you think there is no harm if a man like me takes that exercise merely with the aid of the book?
('38', 262, 1, 8, 538163) 5. Am I right if I find a slight difference between your method and the rules laid down in the commentaries on the Rigveda and the other texts for interpreting the hymns?
('38', 262, 1, 9, 538334) I shall be in Amboli till the 18th of this month.

('38', 262, 7, 14, 538527) BHAISHRI FULCHAND, I have written to you but have had no reply.
('38', 262, 7, 15, 538591) Please see that my capacity to raise funds has gone down considerably owing to my failing health.
('38', 262, 7, 16, 538689) I had made some provision but it is not available at the moment.
('38', 262, 7, 17, 538754) Had I not had the attack I could have somehow coped with the situation.
('38', 262, 7, 18, 538826) I had asked Mahadev to write to Devchandbhai about the speech [drafted] by Bhai Amritlal Bapa.
('38', 262, 7, 19, 538921) It has to be examined carefully.
('38', 262, 7, 20, 538954) I think the [Kathiawar] Political Conference and the charkha movement should be kept apart.
('38', 262, 7, 21, 539046) Let it be like this.
('38', 262, 7, 22, 539067) There are three heads of expenditure which can be arranged as follows:
('38', 262, 8, 23, 539138) 1 Non germination or passivity in germination in plants and limiting copulation to periods of heat in animals
('38', 263, 0, 1, 539248) 264 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 263, 1, 2, 539290) 1. Entrusting khadi activity to the Charkha Sangh as it will survive me and carry on in whatever manner it can.
('38', 263, 1, 3, 539402) 2. The schools and the Antyaja work be handed over to the Vidyapith which too will survive me.
('38', 263, 1, 4, 539497) And an independent activity for Kathiawar.
('38', 263, 1, 5, 539540) We have not yet been able to make separate arrangements to run these three programmes on their own.
('38', 263, 1, 6, 539640) I can therefore make only these suggestions.
('38', 263, 1, 7, 539685) Khadi activities can also be entrusted to the Gujarat Khadi Mandal.
('38', 263, 1, 8, 539753) This can be finalized after we have a discussion with Bhai Lakshmidas.
('38', 263, 1, 9, 539824) Besides these three, no other programme is, at present, likely to engage my attention.
('38', 263, 1, 10, 539911) I see however that there ought to be an independent institution for those pursuing other interests and the Political Conference may serve this purpose.
('38', 263, 1, 11, 540063) But then these are the sick thoughts of a sick man.
('38', 263, 1, 12, 540115) You should contact Devchandbhai and others and find out a way after cool deliberation.
('38', 263, 1, 13, 540202) If you want to see me you should all come at your own expense; that too a fortnight hence.
('38', 263, 1, 14, 540293) I think at the moment I have not the strength to discuss the matter at length.
('38', 263, 1, 15, 540372) God willing, I hope to keep the appointed date in the month of June.
('38', 263, 1, 16, 540441) But I can say nothing definite just now.
('38', 263, 1, 17, 540482) What you do, do unhesitatingly and dispassionately like volu ntary trustees.
('38', 263, 2, 18, 540559) Blessings from

('38', 264, 3, 14, 541509) How is Champa pulling on?
('38', 264, 3, 15, 541535) A copy of the resolutions, etc., should have appeared in Navajivan.
('38', 264, 3, 16, 541603) I forgot to give you the hint because I left in a hurry.
('38', 264, 3, 17, 541660) But then would you not take up the burden of all this worry?
('38', 264, 3, 18, 541721) Hari ichchha and others may live rent free.
('38', 264, 3, 19, 541765) Consult Maganlal about accommodating them and then ask them to come over.
('38', 264, 3, 20, 541839) If you find they cannot be accommodated with anyone we will have to wait for a while.

('38', 265, 3, 7, 542405) Now you should return to your place in the Ashram only after Chi.
('38', 265, 3, 8, 542471) Mama is completely at rest.
('38', 265, 3, 9, 542499) You should make Chi.

('38', 265, 8, 18, 542884) By the time this appears in print, one day of the precious week will have gone.
('38', 265, 8, 19, 542964) I would urge the reader not to fritter away the week by asking the question, What shall we do?, but to make the best possible use of it by asking, What shall I do? There was a time when we could usefully ask and did ask the other question.
('38', 265, 8, 20, 543204) And if each one will do his or her duty to the fullest measure possible, we shall soon be able to ask, What shall we do next? The foundation of satyagraha as of nation building is undou btedly self purification, self dedication, selflessness.
('38', 265, 8, 21, 543447) Let each one ask oneself: How then can I purify myself in terms of the nation? Rectitude of private character is surely the beginning of the structure.
('38', 265, 8, 22, 543599) If my private character is foul, I am like a sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.
('38', 265, 8, 23, 543680) If then I am not right inside, I must this very instant purge myself and be a fit vessel for dedication.
('38', 265, 8, 24, 543785) Government cannot

('38', 266, 1, 2, 543987) help me or interfere with me here.
('38', 266, 1, 3, 544022) I must be the sole author of my making or unmaking.
('38', 266, 1, 4, 544074) Having ensured a pure personal character I must ask the next question, what shall I do as a national servant?
('38', 266, 1, 5, 544184) If a Hindu, I hate the Mussalman or a person of another faith, I must at once make an honourable peace with him.
('38', 266, 1, 6, 544297) If I regard any single person as an untouchable, I must blot the sin from my heart and hug the one whom I have hitherto in my arrogance or ignorance regarded as untouchable and as a token I must render him some personal service, be it only going to his quarters and calling the children together and playing with them.
('38', 266, 1, 7, 544616) In these things again, I need no support from the Government and yet in doing these things whole heartedly I have surely brought swaraj nearer for the effort and rendered myself fitter for joint service whenever the occasion arises.
('38', 266, 1, 8, 544849) Is there a drink shop near me?
('38', 266, 1, 9, 544880) I must try to wean an erring brother from going to the house of his own destruction.
('38', 266, 1, 10, 544965) We began this work gloriously in 1921. Our violence brought it to an inglorious end.
('38', 266, 1, 11, 545050) Individual effort in this matter is still possible even though the atmosphere for wholesale mass action is for the moment wanting.
('38', 266, 1, 12, 545181) And last but not least, I must do my share of spinning, if I have but faith in its capacity to serve the poorest, so graphically described in Markhams words reproduced 1 in last weeks Young India.
('38', 266, 1, 13, 545378) I must hawk Khadi.
('38', 266, 1, 14, 545397) If I have the power, I must induce my neighbour to spin for the sake of Daridranarayana and if he or she wears foreign cloth, I must induce him or her to discard it.
('38', 266, 1, 15, 545563) Shri Vallabhbhai has approached, during this National Week, the Gujaratis living in Kathiawar, Gujarat and in foreign countries for donations for the benefit of the suppressed classes in Gujarat.
('38', 266, 1, 16, 545759) His appeal is for one lakh of rupees to support the activities being carried on at present for the uplift of the depressed classes in Gujarat.
('38', 266, 1, 17, 545902) I would like to enrol myself as Vallabhbhais volunteer and move from house to house, begging bowl in hand, to plead with my dear friends to fill it, and also persuade them to enrol themselves as volunteers for the collection, and persuade also school going girls and young women to do likewise, with the permission of their parents, and help in swelling the contents of Vallabhbhais purse.

('38', 267, 1, 4, 546586) Let each one find out for himself or herself the best way of service during this week of privilege.
('38', 267, 1, 5, 546686) The seeker will be amazed to discover in the search after individual action, the immense possibilities of silent, sustained and fruitful common action.
('38', 267, 1, 6, 546838) Let not the immensity of a common programme daze or paralyse us.
('38', 267, 1, 7, 546903) What is true of the individual will be tomorrow true of the whole nation if individuals will but refuse to lose heart and hope.

('38', 268, 4, 10, 548407) 1 A message which the addressee does not like must not be read out.
('38', 268, 4, 11, 548475) It would have been better if you had not published it in the other journals.
('38', 268, 4, 12, 548552) You would have missed nothing by withholding it.
('38', 268, 4, 13, 548601) Moreover a poets anger, I think, makes him into a milch cow 2. I will swallow all his displeasures but even from at a distance I will utilize his talents.

('38', 268, 8, 20, 548992) But I could not try any of them for want of a proper guru.
('38', 268, 8, 21, 549051) Luckily now I am on a sick bed so I get something to read and ruminate.
('38', 268, 8, 22, 549123) I am further inclined towards asanas on reading Satavalekars articles on the subject.
('38', 268, 8, 23, 549209) Being a disciple of Nathuram Sharma, you have, I expect, some experience in this subject.
('38', 268, 8, 24, 549299) I knew him, but he did not impress me.
('38', 268, 8, 25, 549338) Some four or five members of our family came under his influence.
('38', 268, 8, 26, 549404) But being inconspicuous I could not learn asanas, etc., from him.
('38', 268, 8, 27, 549470) Now I would like to know about your experience of the same.
('38', 268, 8, 28, 549530) Have you studied this?
('38', 268, 8, 29, 549553) If you have, have you kept up the practice?

('38', 269, 3, 4, 549941) BHAISHRI AMRITLAL, You must have seen my letter 1 to Amritlal Bapa.
('38', 269, 3, 5, 550009) I want you to look into it.
('38', 269, 3, 6, 550037) After all, his speech has been drafted by you.
('38', 269, 3, 7, 550084) I want this matter to be settled purely on the basis of principle.
('38', 269, 3, 8, 550151) We must not let my personal feelings interfere with it.
('38', 269, 3, 9, 550207) And if it is a question of my feelings I am all for what suits the atmosphere in Kathiawar and is ultimately good for its people.
('38', 269, 3, 10, 550337) I am for khadi because I see advantage in it; but how could it prove beneficial if the climate is against it?
('38', 269, 3, 11, 550447) Oxygen is vital for our breathing but what is it to the trees?
('38', 269, 3, 12, 550510) And you all are the life of Kathiawar.
('38', 269, 3, 13, 550549) If I cannot convince you all about a thing, either I should not do it at all or do it in a different way.
('38', 269, 3, 14, 550655) I am aware of your ability.
('38', 269, 3, 15, 550683) I very much appreciate some of the things you do.
('38', 269, 3, 16, 550733) I count you among those serving the motherland.
('38', 269, 3, 17, 550781) You have courage which you should exercise to encourage others and contend with me, if you have to, without hesitation.
('38', 269, 3, 18, 550901) Do what you want to do, not what I want you to.
('38', 269, 3, 19, 550949) That alone will be the right thing.
('38', 269, 3, 20, 550985) Surely we cannot shine in borrowed feathers.
('38', 269, 3, 21, 551030) At the moment I can take no interest in activities other than khadi or similar constructive work.
('38', 269, 3, 22, 551128) Being thus engaged, if I have any more to live, it might some day occur to me to offer battle within the limits of satyagraha and if the struggle does not come off in my own lifetime it will be taken up by such of my successors as can do it.
('38', 269, 3, 23, 551370) Bloody revolutions just do not appeal to me.
('38', 269, 3, 24, 551415) I never wish to kill even a venomous snake, not to speak of a venomous man.
('38', 269, 3, 25, 551491) I know the world has gone in for bloody revolution too for winning freedom.
('38', 269, 3, 26, 551567) I wish to spend all my life trying to prove its futility.
('38', 269, 3, 27, 551625) I take delight in this only and so I never lose patience.
('38', 269, 3, 28, 551683) All the ways that occur to me are but ways of peace.
('38', 269, 3, 29, 551736) That for me is the straight and therefore the shortest path.
('38', 269, 3, 30, 551797) You should lend me your support only if it appeals to you and to those who look to you for guidance; otherwise, it is best to leave me alone as it has been said: Ones own dharma is superior to 2, etc.
('38', 269, 3, 31, 551998) Lying in a sick bed, I get more time to think and therefore I am trying to clarify our views and my own.

('38', 270, 2, 5, 552486) There may well be some difference of opinion in respect of auctions.
('38', 270, 2, 6, 552555) I see nothing wrong in auctions, the institution in itself is certainly without blemish; nor is there anything bad in the purpose for which it was held.
('38', 270, 2, 7, 552708) Then why oppose it?
('38', 270, 2, 8, 552728) I would suggest that a serious student like you should not draw hasty conclusions.
('38', 270, 2, 9, 552811) And a pure activity like khadi deserves closer study.

('38', 271, 2, 3, 553660) Friday [April 8, 1927] 1
('38', 271, 3, 4, 553685) NARANDAS, I have not been writing to you at all, but I keep myself informed all the time about your activities.
('38', 271, 3, 5, 553797) I had preserved one of your letters drawing my attention to the expenditure on khadi work in Gujarat.
('38', 271, 3, 6, 553899) I intended to discuss it with Lakshmidas and you.
('38', 271, 3, 7, 553949) But that could not be.
('38', 271, 3, 8, 553972) Let us see if we can take it up some time.
('38', 271, 3, 9, 554015) I believe your contention is that in enabling the spinners to earn Rs. 29,000 as wages we have spent more than an equal amount and that this is too much.
('38', 271, 3, 10, 554169) Does this amount also include the expenditure incurred on our work amongst the Raniparaj community?
('38', 271, 3, 11, 554269) The answer to this question should be that at this stage the work on khadi includes awakening and educating the masses.
('38', 271, 3, 12, 554389) If this is really so, it is part of our policy; and so long as this policy is followed sincerely we should bear with it as an experiment.
('38', 271, 3, 13, 554527) But this is only my view.
('38', 271, 3, 14, 554553) If you enlighten me on this point I shall discuss it with Lakshmidas in case he meets me sooner or when all three of us meet.
('38', 271, 3, 15, 554679) 2. At the present moment, at any rate, I am afraid, I have no time or energy to raise separate funds for khadi work in Kathiawar.
('38', 271, 3, 16, 554809) I, therefore, think that we should entrust it to the Charkha Sangh and carry on such work as can be done subject to its rules and regulations.
('38', 271, 3, 17, 554952) In this connection I have written to Bhai Fulchand.
('38', 271, 3, 18, 555004) You may also think over it.
('38', 271, 3, 19, 555032) Perhaps it had better be merged with the work in Gujarat.
('38', 271, 3, 20, 555090) As it is, I only see this much, that it cannot be carried on as an independent unit.
('38', 271, 3, 21, 555175) You may, if you want to, discuss the matter with Lakshmidas, in case he is there, and with Shankerlal.
('38', 271, 3, 22, 555278) In the meanwhile you may look after and promote the work in Kathiawar according to facilities available in the Ashram and keep me informed.
('38', 271, 3, 23, 555418) We should be careful and see that whatever work has been or is being done is not undone.
('38', 271, 3, 24, 555507) 3. Of late you have not been publishing in Young India facts and figures [about khadi].
('38', 271, 3, 25, 555595) Figures of production, at any rate, ought to appear.
('38', 271, 3, 26, 555648) You should also keep sending any interesting details about the yarn you receive from the members.

('38', 272, 7, 13, 556255) Certainly I do wish that we got out of narrow caste circles.
('38', 272, 7, 14, 556316) The significance of dharma does not lie in clinging to the caste system; it is strictly confined to varnashrama.
('38', 272, 7, 15, 556429) One never hears of hundreds of varnas.
('38', 272, 7, 16, 556468) But I do not insist on this point.

('38', 273, 3, 4, 556716) BHAI DAMODAR LAKSHMIDAS, Bhai Kishorelal conveyed to me the news of Chi.
('38', 273, 3, 5, 556789) Mamabais demise.
('38', 273, 3, 6, 556806) We cannot help grieving owing to the bonds of flesh.
('38', 273, 3, 7, 556859) But when looking at it from Mamabais standpoint, I realize that she has been released from pain.
('38', 273, 3, 8, 556956) I am not well enough acquainted with you but I would, if I may, advise you to cherish and remain faithful to her memory, abstaining from another alliance.
('38', 273, 3, 9, 557111) You have the great responsibility of the children.
('38', 273, 3, 10, 557162) Make arrangements for them in consultation with pujya Gangabehn and do what you can to advance their interests.

('38', 274, 2, 4, 557585) Mamas passing away.
('38', 274, 2, 5, 557605) The poor girl was in agony.
('38', 274, 2, 6, 557633) And it was good that you were with her at the last hour.
('38', 274, 2, 7, 557690) I have written to [your] son in law.
('38', 274, 2, 8, 557727) We are left with the problem of what we should do about the children.
('38', 274, 2, 9, 557797) The question now is whether or not you should accept custody of the children if he leaves them in your care and offers their maintenance.
('38', 274, 2, 10, 557935) Please think over this.
('38', 274, 2, 11, 557959) I am sure you have not been upset.

('38', 274, 8, 20, 558325) A detailed letter may never get written because of my procrastination, so I write a brief one right away.
('38', 274, 8, 21, 558431) You still continue to regret that you have no formal education.
('38', 274, 8, 22, 558495) You must get over it.
('38', 274, 8, 23, 558517) In my programme of action it is of least importance.
('38', 274, 8, 24, 558570) If you come, you can be of help in innumerable ways.
('38', 274, 8, 25, 558623) You can even work on a salary if you so wish.
('38', 274, 8, 26, 558669) I would make use of you in spinning and weaving and make you independent.
('38', 274, 8, 27, 558743) I would also use you for the service of the country.
('38', 274, 8, 28, 558796) But there are many other jobs apart from these.
('38', 274, 8, 29, 558844) There is the work of the press, of the school, of Hindi.
('38', 274, 8, 30, 558901) Many people, big and small, are helping me.
('38', 274, 8, 31, 558945) I am sure that you too can join them.

('38', 275, 2, 3, 559263) April 11, 1927
('38', 275, 3, 4, 559278) MIRA, I have your letter.
('38', 275, 3, 5, 559304) Of course you were quite right in delivering your whole soul to me.
('38', 275, 3, 6, 559372) I quite agree with you that we have to evolve an organization and that therefore there should be method about the business.
('38', 275, 3, 7, 559496) But in your affection for me perhaps there is a trace of impatience with the people who organized the tours.
('38', 275, 3, 8, 559605) However, all will profit by the warning received.
('38', 275, 3, 9, 559655) I am taking all the necessary rest amid these very lovely surroundings and shall have more when I am taken to Mysore.
('38', 275, 3, 10, 559773) Rest is not to be taken at the Ashram.
('38', 275, 3, 11, 559812) Dr. Mehta insisted on a cool place 1 being selected.
('38', 275, 3, 12, 559865) And I am to remain where I was to tour during April.
('38', 275, 3, 13, 559918) You can see from the handwriting that I am getting stronger day by day.
('38', 275, 3, 14, 559990) I had quite a fair walk yesterday.
('38', 275, 3, 15, 560025) So much for myself.
('38', 275, 3, 16, 560045) I like this idea of your riding.
('38', 275, 3, 17, 560078) It should brace you and enable you too, to go to the villages and see something of rural life.
('38', 275, 3, 18, 560173) Have they provided you with a proper saddle?
('38', 275, 3, 19, 560218) You should try to follow all the shades of village Hindi.
('38', 275, 3, 20, 560276) I am not going to be satisfied till you have mastered Hindi so well as to be able to follow and speak the villagers Hindi.
('38', 275, 3, 21, 560399) Do not be frightened.
('38', 275, 3, 22, 560421) It will come because of your love of your work.
('38', 275, 3, 23, 560469) I shall not be impatient.
('38', 275, 3, 24, 560495) But, for your work a thorough knowledge of Hindi is a necessity.
('38', 275, 3, 25, 560560) You will therefore seek every occasion for speaking and knowing it.
('38', 275, 3, 26, 560628) Insist on understanding all that goes on about you.
('38', 275, 3, 27, 560680) Here is a letter for you from Noorbanu whom you must recognize, the fat, fair lady.
('38', 275, 3, 28, 560764) She recently gave over to the Ashram several thousand rupees worth of her jewellery.
('38', 275, 3, 29, 560849) She and her husband are just now living at Mahabaleshwar.
('38', 275, 3, 30, 560907) They have just come in to see me.
('38', 275, 3, 31, 560941) Do write to her in reply.

('38', 276, 6, 9, 561569) Please continue to send me the issues of Vaidika Dharma.
('38', 276, 6, 10, 561626) I have with me many young men as well as women.
('38', 276, 6, 11, 561674) On my part I have made great efforts to keep them in good health while they observed brahmacharya.
('38', 276, 6, 12, 561773) Only disciplines like asanas have yet to be tried.
('38', 276, 6, 13, 561824) Could you suggest to me some methods, as I am afraid, they cannot very well be learnt merely with the help of books and illustration.
('38', 276, 7, 14, 561958) Please send over to the Ashram two copies [each] of Surya bhedan Vyayam and Brahmasharya, which will be paid for by the Ashram.

('38', 277, 3, 4, 562449) SISTERS, You have absolved me [from writing to you].
('38', 277, 3, 5, 562502) But how can I take advantage of it unless I have to?
('38', 277, 3, 6, 562555) My health is not so bad now that I cannot write to you.
('38', 277, 3, 7, 562611) Yesterday I even walked a good distance.
('38', 277, 3, 8, 562652) To write to you is therefore not much of a strain.
('38', 277, 3, 9, 562703) Have any of you decided to supervise the common kitchen by turns?
('38', 277, 3, 10, 562769) Lakshmibehn 2 had definitely expressed willingness to do so.
('38', 277, 3, 11, 562830) If no one else has done it so far at least she should do it.
('38', 277, 3, 12, 562891) If there is any defect in the common kitchen the fault will be that of all.
('38', 277, 3, 13, 562967) Will it not ?
('38', 277, 3, 14, 562981) You may free yourselves from kitchen work when the men have acquired as much skill as you have at present, but certainly not till then.

('38', 278, 1, 5, 564358) We have kept the week 1 here in a royal style.
('38', 278, 1, 6, 564405) One wheel has been kept going 16 hours daily.
('38', 278, 1, 7, 564451) The output has been more than 3,000 rounds of 4 ft.
('38', 278, 1, 8, 564503) each daily.

('38', 278, 1, 14, 564740) I am glad you met the Commissioner, etc.
('38', 278, 1, 15, 564781) You are getting your desertsthose of one adopted by a scavenger.
('38', 278, 1, 16, 564846) You must forget what you have been.
('38', 278, 1, 17, 564882) You have to realize what you are.

('38', 278, 1, 22, 565248) This was the least part of the affair.
('38', 278, 1, 23, 565287) He was taken for a common sailor.

('38', 278, 6, 32, 565610) Undoubtedly the study of hygiene is most essential.
('38', 278, 6, 33, 565662) This would include asanas and breath control which, I think, would need a guide.
('38', 278, 6, 34, 565743) I would like you to practise them.
('38', 278, 6, 35, 565778) Nathji has some experience in this field.
('38', 278, 6, 36, 565820) He does not seem to have much faith in it.
('38', 278, 6, 37, 565863) Having discussed it with a few people I was led to believe that asanas, etc.,

('38', 279, 1, 2, 566185) were of no avail in curing the sick.
('38', 279, 1, 3, 566222) I have not personally reached this conclusion.
('38', 279, 1, 4, 566269) If you want to learn them I would send you to Pandit Satavalekar.
('38', 279, 1, 5, 566335) There is a swami in Hardwar who also has promised to train an ashramite if one goes to him.
('38', 279, 1, 6, 566427) I have not met him though Mahadev has.
('38', 279, 1, 7, 566466) Nowhere have I found the purity that I would expect but then we want to associate only to the extent of learning the asanas, etc.

('38', 279, 6, 12, 566709) An M.B.B.S. from Mandalay sends a string of questions of which the first is:
('38', 279, 7, 13, 566786) You once expressed your opinion in the pages of Young India that faith begins
('38', 279, 8, 14, 566864) where reason ends.
('38', 279, 8, 15, 566883) Then I expect you will call it faith, if a person believes in a thing for which he can give no reasons.
('38', 279, 8, 16, 566987) Is it not then clear that faith is believing unreasonably?
('38', 279, 8, 17, 567046) Do you think it is truth or justice if anybody believed in anything unreasonable?
('38', 279, 8, 18, 567128) I think it is folly to believc in that way.
('38', 279, 8, 19, 567172) I do not know what your barrister mind will call it.
('38', 279, 8, 20, 567225) If you think like me I hope you will call faith as nothing but folly.
('38', 279, 8, 21, 567295) If the worthy doctor will excuse my saying so, there is in his question a clear failure to understand my meaning.
('38', 279, 8, 22, 567409) That which is beyond reason is surely not unreasonable.
('38', 279, 8, 23, 567465) Unreasonable belief is blind faith and is often superstition.
('38', 279, 8, 24, 567527) To ask anybody to believe without proof what is capable of proof would be unreasonable, as for instance asking an intelligent person to believe without proof that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles.
('38', 279, 8, 25, 567756) But for an experienced person to ask another to believe without being able to prove that there is God is humbly to confess his limitations and to ask another to accept in faith the statement of his experience.
('38', 279, 8, 26, 567966) It is merely a question of that persons credibility.
('38', 279, 8, 27, 568019) In ordinary matters of life we accept in faith the word of persons on whom we choose to rely although we are often cheated.
('38', 279, 8, 28, 568143) Why may we not then in matters of life and death accept the testimony of sages all the world over that there is God and that He is to be seen by following Truth and Innocence (non violence)?
('38', 279, 8, 29, 568334) It is at least as reasonable for me to ask my correspondent to have that faith in this universal testimony as it would
('38', 280, 0, 1, 568453) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 281
('38', 280, 1, 2, 568496) be for him to ask me to take his medicine in faith even though many a medicine man might have failed me.
('38', 280, 1, 3, 568601) I make bold to say that without faith this world would come to naught in a moment.
('38', 280, 1, 4, 568684) True faith is appropriation of the reasoned experience of people whom we believe to have lived a life purified by prayer and penance.
('38', 280, 1, 5, 568818) Belief therefore in prophets or incarnations who have lived in remote ages is not an idle superstition but a satisfaction of an inmost, spiritual want.
('38', 280, 1, 6, 568970) The formula therefore I have humbly suggested for guidance is rejection of every demand for faith where a matter is capable of present proof unquestioned acceptance on faith of that which is itself incapable of proof except through personal experience.
('38', 280, 1, 7, 569223) The correspondents next question is: 1
('38', 280, 2, 8, 569262) In Young India of December 9, 1926, 2 there appeared a press cutting that one Doctor Harold Blazer, who chloroformed his daughter because he felt that his own end was near and there was no one to care for her when he was gone, was fully acquitted.
('38', 280, 2, 9, 569510) Dr. Blazers counsel, Mr. Howry declared: Blazer did a right and moral thing by keeping the poor girl [for whom he had cared for thirty two years] from becoming a charge on others. To this you expressed your opinion that Dr. Blazer was wrong in taking the life of his daughter because it betrayed want of faith in the humanity of those round him and that there was no warrant for him to suppose that the daughter would not have been cared for by others....
('38', 280, 2, 10, 569966) I would request you to think over it again, for I think this is not an ordinary matter.
('38', 280, 2, 11, 570054) For it is evident that you have got no scruples to put a useless burden on society simply because you have got enough faith in the society to shoulder the burden.
('38', 280, 2, 12, 570217) For Gods sake please excuse us from believing in that useless, nay, extremely harmful, faith.
('38', 280, 2, 13, 570311) Such a faith of yours, I sincerely believe, is very harmful to the best interests of India....
('38', 280, 2, 14, 570406) If after many more years of faithful service of India, you become .
('38', 280, 2, 15, 570474) absolutely useless to society, will you like the society to feed you because you have got still life left in you or because you served so well?
('38', 280, 2, 16, 570618) I do believe that whilst the jury was right in acquitting Dr. Blazer, considered from the strictly moral point of view Dr. Blazer was wrong.
('38', 280, 2, 17, 570759) My correspondent in his utilitarian zeal has overlooked the frightful consequences and implications of the doctrine he lays down.
('38', 280, 2, 18, 570889) Indeed his doctrine would belie his own profession.
('38', 280, 2, 19, 570941) What would he say if a young practitioner chloroformed to death a patient whom he, the junior practitioner, considered to be incurable and therefore a useless burden to society and whom another as a senior subsequently found to be a case quite capable of cure ?
('38', 280, 2, 20, 571203) Is it not the boast of

('38', 281, 1, 3, 571404) As for myself, well, I do expect my countrymen to support me when I become a useless and burdensome article, assuming of course that I shall still want to live.
('38', 281, 1, 4, 571565) What is more, I have full faith in my countrymen suppor ting me if that event comes to pass.
('38', 281, 1, 5, 571658) I wonder whether my corres pondent will have all the lepers, the blind, the deaf, one fine night to be chloroformed to sweet, everlasting sleep.
('38', 281, 1, 6, 571803) And yet Damien was a leper and Milton was a blind poet.
('38', 281, 1, 7, 571859) Man is not all body but he is something infinitely higher.
('38', 281, 1, 8, 571918) The correspondents third question is: 1
('38', 281, 2, 9, 571958) In the same article, i.e., The Greatest Good of all, you wrote that a votary of ahimsa cannot subscribe to the utilitarian formula.
('38', 281, 2, 10, 572090) He will strive for the greatest good of all and die in the attempt to realize the ideal .
('38', 281, 2, 11, 572180) May I conclude then that you will prefer to be bitten by a poisonous snake and die rather than kill the same in trying to save yourself?
('38', 281, 2, 12, 572317) If I am right in my conclusion, .
('38', 281, 2, 13, 572351) that way you will be doing the greatest possible harm to India by trying to save a harmful living creature and by dying willingly in trying to realize the ideal of your so called greatest good of all .
('38', 281, 2, 14, 572553) You admit that you are an imperfect mortal.
('38', 281, 2, 15, 572597) So it is impossible for you to benefit the whole world.
('38', 281, 2, 16, 572653) It is even impossible for you to benefit the whole of India in all possible ways.
('38', 281, 2, 17, 572735) Therefore it is quite reasonable to be contented with the greatest good of the greatest number rather than pretend to do the greatest good to all without exception the good and the wicked, the useful and the useless, man, animal, etc., etc.
('38', 281, 2, 18, 572976) This is a question I would fain avoid answering, not because of want of faith but because of want of courage.
('38', 281, 2, 19, 573086) But I must not conceal my faith even though I may not have the courage to act up to it when it is put on its trial.
('38', 281, 2, 20, 573202) Here then is my answer.
('38', 281, 2, 21, 573226) I do not want to live at the cost of the life even of a snake.
('38', 281, 2, 22, 573289) I should let him bite me to death rather than kill him.
('38', 281, 2, 23, 573345) But it is likely that if God puts me to that cruel test and permits a snake to assault me, I may not have the courage to die, but that the beast in me may assert itself and I may seek to kill the snake in defending this perishable body.
('38', 281, 2, 24, 573582) I admit that my belief has not yet become so incarnate in me as to warrant my stating emphatically that I have shed all fear of snakes so as to befriend them as I would like to be able to.
('38', 281, 2, 25, 573771) It is my implicit belief that snakes, tigers, etc., are Gods answer to the poisonous, wicked, evil thoughts that we harbour.
('38', 281, 2, 26, 573896) Anna Kingsford saw in the streets of Paris tigers in men already taking shape.
('38', 281, 2, 27, 573975) I believe that all life is one.
('38', 281, 2, 28, 574007) Thoughts take definite forms.

('38', 282, 1, 4, 574338) I shall not do so if in my impatient ignorance and in my desire to prolong the existence of the body I seek to kill the so called venomous beasts and reptiles.
('38', 282, 1, 5, 574498) If in not seeking to defend myself against such noxious animals I die, I should die to rise again a better and a fuller man.
('38', 282, 1, 6, 574623) With that faith in me how should I seek to kill a fellow being in a snake?
('38', 282, 1, 7, 574698) But this is philosophy.
('38', 282, 1, 8, 574722) Let me pray and let my readers join in the prayer to God that He may give me the strength to live up to that philosophy.
('38', 282, 1, 9, 574843) For philosophy without life corresponding is like a body without life.
('38', 282, 1, 10, 574914) I know that in this land of ours we have enouh phiosophy and but little life.
('38', 282, 1, 11, 574992) But I know also that the laws governing the conduct of man have still to be explored and the condition of exploration is imperative and unalterable.
('38', 282, 1, 12, 575141) We shall explore them only by dying, never by killing.

('38', 283, 9, 23, 576970) From the consideration you have been showing me I see that you are treating me as a fellow seeker.
('38', 283, 9, 24, 577069) I shall certainly try to become one.
('38', 283, 9, 25, 577106) I read your book on the Isopanishad and was extremely pleased.

('38', 284, 1, 2, 577440) I am acquainted with Kuvalayanandji.
('38', 284, 1, 3, 577477) I had sent a young boy to him who being weak was not taught pranayama and other disciplines but was instead treated with medicines.
('38', 284, 1, 4, 577609) Despite the prevailing climate I have not lost hope regarding the practice of brahmacharya, etc.
('38', 284, 1, 5, 577706) There will rise from our midst a true aspirant who will clear the prevailing atmosphere.
('38', 284, 1, 6, 577795) As yet I have come across no such aspirant.
('38', 284, 1, 7, 577839) My own tapascharya is hopelessly imperfect.
('38', 284, 1, 8, 577883) I have been observing external, physical brahmacharya for nearly 30 years.
('38', 284, 1, 9, 577958) I have, however, not freed myself from passion; I am trying to.
('38', 284, 1, 10, 578022) I think complete control of all the five sense organs is essential for the observance of perfect brahmacharya.
('38', 284, 1, 11, 578133) It will not suffice to have control over the six fold passion 1; it has to be rooted out.
('38', 284, 1, 12, 578223) I believe in every word of the verse: The yearning too departs when he beholds the Supreme. 2 The world is prone to hero worship.
('38', 284, 1, 13, 578353) The unhealthy climate prevailing around will soon clear when such a person emerges.
('38', 284, 1, 14, 578437) Let us work with all our faith for the advent of such a person amidst us.
('38', 284, 1, 15, 578511) And have not you yourself said that if the message of the Upanishads, etc., is eternally trueand so it is even today we can come across Uma, Hemavati and Yaksha and, God willing, we shall.
('38', 284, 1, 16, 578700) I too have read about rubbing in semen and consuming it.
('38', 284, 1, 17, 578757) 3 I regard this as a demoniac practice.
('38', 284, 1, 18, 578797) There may be some truth in it but the experiment deserves no consideration, because we want the brahmacharis to master their senses.
('38', 284, 1, 19, 578930) Preserving and retaining the vital fluid is a means to an end and not an end in itself.
('38', 284, 1, 20, 579018) Consuming semen does not bring about freedom from passion; it might to some extent remove the debility consequent upon ejaculation.
('38', 284, 1, 21, 579150) This is what the Western method achieves.
('38', 284, 1, 22, 579192) The root cause of seminal discharge lies in the rising of passion, [And] we aim at annihilating all passion.
('38', 284, 1, 23, 579301) That is why I enquired about the asanas, etc, Now I understand that asanas, etc., are a stage on the way [to brahmacharya] and it may be deemed necessary for the aspirant to pass through them.
('38', 284, 1, 24, 579494) Have I made myself clear ?
('38', 284, 1, 25, 579521) I have understood what you say in your book about the asanas for retaining semen.
('38', 284, 1, 26, 579603) Your cautions put one on guard.

('38', 285, 1, 2, 579936) married man I see no harm in the siddha and other asanas.
('38', 285, 1, 3, 579994) With the help of siddhasana a married mans semen may possibly be retained, the secretion however does not stop.
('38', 285, 1, 4, 580106) How many men can we come across today who go to their wives purely for the sake of progeny?
('38', 285, 1, 5, 580198) If the term calming down can be used of passion etc., a married man may calm down his passion with the help of siddha and other asanas.
('38', 285, 1, 6, 580334) But then it is another thing if his aim is absolute eradication of desire.
('38', 285, 1, 7, 580409) I was relieved to find that you do not reject the Puranas.
('38', 285, 1, 8, 580468) I was afraid you would be disdainful of the ancient Puranas.
('38', 285, 1, 9, 580529) Indeed I am convinced that at a time when people were growing sceptical the authors of the Puranas aroused in them a love for dharma with their rich poetic appeal, Our Shastras need to be re interpreted as you are doing, in the light of modern knowledge and for the young people of today.
('38', 285, 1, 10, 580818) When I am settled somewhere I would like to give you the trouble of coming over to me so that we can compare notes.

('38', 287, 13, 19, 584081) His Highness and the Rani came to see Gandhiji on the day before we left Amboli.
('38', 287, 13, 20, 584162) They were as usual very nice and asked if it was not too late to persuade Gandhiji to stay a little longer at Amboli.
('38', 287, 13, 21, 584280) Gandhiji said he wished very much he could continue his stay in that scented spot surrounded by picturesque scenery, in fact, he was distressed to leave it, but he could not help it as he wanted to combine rest with work.
('38', 287, 13, 22, 584502) And then Gandhiji proceeded to ask the questions I had not asked the other day.
('38', 287, 14, 23, 584582) GANDHIJI: Mahadev has been telling me all the good things he has been hearing about you.

('38', 288, 1, 3, 585097) Is it true that you draw Rs. 2,000 only from the public revenue for your private purse?
('38', 288, 2, 4, 585185) H. H. OF SAVANTWADI: Not Rs. 2,000, but Rs. 2,500; but expenses incurred on all State occasions are met from the State revenue.
('38', 288, 2, 5, 585313) That is all right.
('38', 288, 2, 6, 585332) Now you will stay at Amboli during the summer months.
('38', 288, 2, 7, 585386) Will the expenses be borne by the State?
('38', 288, 3, 8, 585427) No, they will be borne by me.
('38', 288, 3, 9, 585457) And I hear you are keeping with you a number of orphans.
('38', 288, 3, 10, 585514) You find their expenses too out of your purse?
('38', 288, 4, 11, 585561) Yes, Gandhiji.
('38', 288, 4, 12, 585576) But they are not all orphans.
('38', 288, 4, 13, 585606) Some of them are.
('38', 288, 4, 14, 585624) They come of poor but respectable families.
('38', 288, 4, 15, 585668) There are many more applications but I am sorry I cannot afford to have more.
('38', 288, 4, 16, 585746) Well, yours is the only instance I know of a ruling prince drawing a fixed allowance from the public revenue.
('38', 288, 5, 17, 585856) No, you might expect to see many more.
('38', 288, 5, 18, 585895) The Mysore Maharaja draws a fixed allowance.
('38', 288, 5, 19, 585940) Then it is lucky that after having stayed under your roof I am going to enjoy the hospitality of one like you.
('38', 288, 6, 20, 586051) Yes, and Gwalior did not draw anything from the State Treasury.
('38', 288, 6, 21, 586115) That is to say?
('38', 288, 7, 22, 586131) He had his private income and lived on that.
('38', 288, 7, 23, 586176) But what is private income but earned from the State itself?
('38', 288, 8, 24, 586237) And now turning to the Rani, who, by the bye, is a princess of the Baroda family, Gandhiji said: Yes, I know one as simple as you, the Maharani Regent of Travancore.
('38', 288, 8, 25, 586403) I was fascinated by her simplicity, 1 her dress could not be simpler, and I looked in vain for an ornament on her person, except the mangalamala.
('38', 288, 8, 26, 586549) The furniture in her room was as severely simple as could be.
('38', 288, 8, 27, 586611) I was introduced to the young Maharaja whom it was difficult to recognize as such.
('38', 288, 8, 28, 586694) But there the comparison ends.
('38', 288, 8, 29, 586725) They do not live on paltry wages like you.
('38', 288, 9, 30, 586768) The Rani smiled thankfully, whilst Gandhiji continued: And I was not surprised at the small quantity of khadi that you purchased, knowing as I did that your means were limited and that you must live within your income.
('38', 288, 9, 31, 586987) And now that I know that like His Highness you also mix very much among your people, may I suggest that you will enhance your power of service by mastering the art of

('38', 289, 5, 10, 587655) You must not put yourself under over strain.

('38', 289, 5, 12, 587771) You may make it clear to the people about you as to your physical capacity.
('38', 289, 5, 13, 587847) On no account must you lose your health.
('38', 289, 5, 14, 587888) Do you get proper fruit and milk?
('38', 289, 5, 15, 587922) I am getting on famously.
('38', 289, 5, 16, 587948) For the last two days I have been taking walks both morning and evening without suffering any harm., As you know I have replaced one fruit with a vegetable and am taking bhakhari.
('38', 289, 5, 17, 588128) We leave Amboli today and leave Belgaum tomorrow if all goes well.
('38', 289, 5, 18, 588195) Nandi Hills, Mysore, will be the address for the next two months.
('38', 289, 5, 19, 588261) I shall not leave this place without much regret.
('38', 289, 5, 20, 588311) The spot itself is delightful.
('38', 289, 5, 21, 588342) But what has attached me to this place is the exceptional character of the Chief.
('38', 289, 5, 22, 588424) From all the accounts received by me he appears to be an ideal Chief.
('38', 289, 5, 23, 588494) He draws a fixed sum from the State revenue for his personal expenses.
('38', 289, 5, 24, 588565) He mixes freely with his people.
('38', 289, 5, 25, 588598) He has visited every one of his 125 villages.
('38', 289, 5, 26, 588644) He lives an abstemious life and his wife is worthy of him.
('38', 289, 5, 27, 588703) I have met him often and his frank and easy manners have pleased me.
('38', 289, 5, 28, 588772) Hence it is that I like this place so much.
('38', 289, 5, 29, 588816) But we cant do always the things we like.
('38', 289, 5, 30, 588858) We shall be leaving inside of a few hours.
('38', 289, 5, 31, 588901) I expect a report of the new charkha.

('38', 290, 2, 5, 589345) Your attitude towards the children is correct.
('38', 290, 2, 6, 589392) If Damodardas entrusts custody of the children to you, you being in the Ashram, it would be your duty to look after them.
('38', 290, 2, 7, 589514) But it must suit the Ashram too.
('38', 290, 2, 8, 589547) Discuss the issue with Kaka.

('38', 290, 7, 19, 590169) Your work should now be so perfectly regulated that it goes on automatically as in other institutions.
('38', 290, 7, 20, 590272) In order that this may happen, a leader is absolutely necessary.

('38', 291, 7, 15, 591579) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter to Baba Saheb Soman offering to come to Mysore at once if necessary and in any case after 26th if required.
('38', 291, 7, 16, 591728) I would like you to come to Nandi Hills as soon as possible after 26th.
('38', 291, 7, 17, 591800) If you will kindly send a wire, arrangements will be made to bring you to Nandi Hills from the nearest station.
('38', 291, 7, 18, 591912) The growing self abuse among the students has, as you know, attracted me to the yogic asanas, as possible cure of the evil habit.
('38', 291, 7, 19, 592042) In the course of my reading I saw that asanas were recommended as a remedy for the cure of many other ills.
('38', 291, 7, 20, 592150) During my illness I read Pandit Satavalekars writings.
('38', 291, 7, 21, 592205) And I thought that I would experiment with myself.
('38', 291, 7, 22, 592256) Copious laudatory notices of shirshasana drew me to it.
('38', 291, 7, 23, 592312) And for the last five days I have been trying shirshasana for a few seconds each time.
('38', 291, 7, 24, 592399) I do it in the morning before the meal twice at intervals of two minutes.
('38', 291, 7, 25, 592473) The practice is preceded by neti, cleansing the nostrils by means of strips of thin cloth.
('38', 291, 7, 26, 592564) I remain absolutely passive during the practice of the asana.
('38', 291, 7, 27, 592626) Gunaji assists to lift the body and sustain it on the head.
('38', 291, 7, 28, 592686) The same thing is repeated at 9 p.m.
('38', 291, 7, 29, 592723) before retiring.
('38', 291, 7, 30, 592740) The last mealmilk and fruit is taken at 5 p.m.
('38', 291, 7, 31, 592787) I have noticed no ill effects.
('38', 291, 7, 32, 592818) On the contrary, I feel fresher and stronger and am able to take short walks.
('38', 291, 7, 33, 592896) My appetite has improved.
('38', 291, 7, 34, 592922) Now the question is whether shirshasana thus passively practised is likely to

('38', 292, 1, 2, 593043) ease the blood pressure or to increase it.
('38', 292, 1, 3, 593086) I take it that neti can do no harm at all in any case.
('38', 292, 1, 4, 593141) My blood pressure is at present 180 by auscultation.
('38', 292, 1, 5, 593194) During the five days the pressure has not increased.
('38', 292, 1, 6, 593247) Will you advise me to continue the practice or discontinue pending your arrival?
('38', 292, 1, 7, 593328) Please wire if you want me to discontinue.
('38', 292, 1, 8, 593371) I do not want the asanas to be blamed through any hasty action on my part.

('38', 293, 1, 4, 594938) The following resolution 1 was however passed unanimously at this meeting: Inasmuch as a resolution was passed at the last meeting of the managing committee of the Association (at Wardha) to the effect that a sum not exceeding one lakh rupees might be spent for conducting a model dairy and a model tannery, it is hereby resolved that the said experiment be conducted by and under the supervision of the managing committee of the Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati, in accordance with the objects of the All India Cow pro tection Association, and to that end a sum not exceeding one lakh rupees, earmarked for the purpose, be donated to the managing committee of the Ashram out of the funds of the Association, with instructions to that commit tee to furnish an account of the progress of the experiment from time to time.

('38', 293, 1, 16, 596408) The resolution contemplates the expendi ture of one lakh of rupees.

('38', 293, 1, 18, 596547) The resolution has been taken in the hope that the Association will receive sufficient donations from the public.
('38', 293, 1, 19, 596661) Now that I must be confined to my rooms for some time to come, I appeal to those who are interested in and approve of the method adopted by the Association for the protection and preserva tion of Indias cattle, to send in their mite, without a personal appeal.

('38', 294, 4, 9, 597796) 297. TRUTH IS ONE
('38', 294, 5, 10, 597814) A Polish Professor writes:
('38', 294, 6, 11, 597841) I am reading with intense joy your fascinating articles in Young India and wish to impress upon you the truth that they are the source of power not only for your own country but for the world.
('38', 294, 6, 12, 598034) And as you have such a wide spiritual experience, may I ask you one question to be answered if possible in Young India?
('38', 294, 6, 13, 598154) It is a very important fundamental question to which an answer from you would have a great value.
('38', 294, 6, 14, 598252) Do you admit that there is in human thought some absolute certainty, as for instance as to God and prayer, where we might be said to have reached perfect unchangeable truth ?
('38', 294, 6, 15, 598427) Do you also confess that some particular experience led you to change your first opinion, for instance, as to the right of killing certain dangerous animals?
('38', 294, 6, 16, 598585) Now my fundamental question is, on what particular points do you change your opinion?
('38', 294, 6, 17, 598671) And what guarantee can these changes leave as to the unshaken truth of what remains certain ?
('38', 294, 6, 18, 598765) How can we distinguish opportunistic change of opinion from the permanence of an absolute certainty in essentials?
('38', 294, 6, 19, 598880) Can you define in what things we may change and what kind of things remain unchangeable?
('38', 294, 6, 20, 598969) Is independence of each country or people one of those absolute truths, or is there some innate incapacity in some nations for self government and in others an innate capacity for governing such incapable nations, as the Ger mans profess to have a capacity for governing other nations and thus justify their ruling ambition?
('38', 294, 6, 21, 599294) I have taken the liberty of altering a word here and there in this letter for the purpose of making the writers meaning clearer than it appears to be to me in the original.
('38', 294, 6, 22, 599467) Without in any shape or form endorsing the claim to the powers that the writer ascribes to me, I
('38', 294, 7, 23, 599564) 1 What follows is from Navajivan, 24 4 1927.
('38', 295, 0, 1, 599609) 296 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 295, 1, 2, 599651) would in all humility endeavour to answer his questions.
('38', 295, 1, 3, 599708) My own conscious claim is very simple and emphatic.
('38', 295, 1, 4, 599760) I am a humble but very earnest seeker after truth.
('38', 295, 1, 5, 599811) And in my search, I take all fellow seekers in uttermost confidence so that I may know my mistakes and correct them.
('38', 295, 1, 6, 599928) I confess that I have often erred in my estimates and judgments.
('38', 295, 1, 7, 599993) As for instance, whereas I thought from insufficient data that the people of Kheda were ready for civil disobedience, I suddenly discovered that I had committed a Himalayan miscalculation and saw that they could not offer civil disobedience inasmuch as they had not known what it was to tender willing obedience to laws which might be even considered irksome but not immoral.
('38', 295, 1, 8, 600369) Immediately I made the discovery, I retraced my steps.
('38', 295, 1, 9, 600424) A similar error of judgment was committed by me when I presented what has been described as the Bardoli ultimatum.
('38', 295, 1, 10, 600539) 1 I had then believed that the country, that is the people, had been awakened and touched by the movement, had understood the utility of nonviolence.
('38', 295, 1, 11, 600689) I discovered my error within twenty four hours of the delivery of the ultimatum and retraced my steps.
('38', 295, 1, 12, 600792) And inasmuch as in every case I retraced my steps, no permanent harm was done.
('38', 295, 1, 13, 600871) On the contrary, the fundamental truth of non violence has been made infinitely more manifest than it ever has been, and the country has in no way been permanently injured.
('38', 295, 1, 14, 601044) But I am not aware of having changed my opinion about the necessity of killing certain dangerous animals in certain circumstances specifically mentioned in my articles 2. So far as I am aware of my own opinions, I have ever held the opinion expressed by me in those articles.
('38', 295, 1, 15, 601320) That however does not mean that the opinion is unchange able.
('38', 295, 1, 16, 601382) I claim to have no infallible guidance or inspiration.
('38', 295, 1, 17, 601437) So far as my experience goes, the claim to infallibility on the part of a human being would be untenable, seeing that inspiration too can come only to one who is free from the action of pairs of opposites, and it will be difficult to judge on a given occasion whether the claim to freedom from pairs of opposites is justified.
('38', 295, 1, 18, 601764) The claim to infallibility would thus always be a most dangerous claim to make.
('38', 295, 1, 19, 601844) This however does not leave us without any guidance whatsoever.
('38', 295, 1, 20, 601908) The sum total of the experience of the sages of the world is available to us and would be for all time to come.
('38', 295, 1, 21, 602020) Moreover, there are not many fundamental truths, but there is only one fundamental truth which is Truth itself,

('38', 296, 1, 2, 602250) otherwise known as Non violence.
('38', 296, 1, 3, 602283) Finite human being shall never know in its fulness Truth and Love which is in itself infinite.
('38', 296, 1, 4, 602378) But we do know enough for our guidance.
('38', 296, 1, 5, 602418) We shall err, and sometimes grievously, in our application.
('38', 296, 1, 6, 602478) But man is a self governing being, and self government necessarily includes the power as much to commit errors as to set them right as often as they are made.
('38', 296, 1, 7, 602637) I do not know whether this will satisfy my correspondent.
('38', 296, 1, 8, 602695) But whether it does or not, I have no power in me to give him a more satisfactory answer.
('38', 296, 1, 9, 602785) After all each one must be a law unto himself, the invariable condition being that he must then walk in the fear of God and therefore continually keep on purifying his heart.
('38', 296, 1, 10, 602960) A man to be a man must be twice born as Hindus would say, reborn as Christians would say.
('38', 296, 1, 11, 603050) The concluding questions of the correspondent are easily answered.
('38', 296, 1, 12, 603117) In fact, the answers can be inferred from the foregoing remarks.
('38', 296, 1, 13, 603182) I do think that independence of each country is a truth in the same sense and to the same extent that independence of each man is.
('38', 296, 1, 14, 603313) There is, therefore, no inherent incapacity for self government in any country or nation and therefore no inherent capacity for governing other nations.
('38', 296, 1, 15, 603466) No doubt my correspondent honestly thinks that Germans profess to have a God given capacity for ruling over other nations.
('38', 296, 1, 16, 603589) But if there are German imperialists, there are also humble German democrats, who are content if they can quietly govern them selves.

('38', 296, 3, 18, 603746) 298. KHADI STORES
('38', 296, 4, 19, 603764) The following list 1 of khadi stores in the four provinces of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and Bihar will be read with interest.
('38', 296, 4, 20, 603896) I propose to publish a list of similar stores in the other provinces as soon as they are available.
('38', 296, 4, 21, 603996) The list is a sign of the very substantial progress made by khadi since 1920. Measured by what we seek to achieve, the progress no doubt leaves much to be desired.
('38', 296, 4, 22, 604160) 110 stores in four provinces should, when khadi becomes current like grain or ghee, read 110 stores in a city like Bombay alone and then they would not be too many.
('38', 296, 4, 23, 604325) And why should it be surprising or unthinkable to have khadi as universal as grain or ghee?
('38', 296, 4, 24, 604417) Or, if such universality for

('38', 297, 0, 1, 604468) 298 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 297, 1, 2, 604510) khadi must be unthinkable, why should it be unthinkable to have, say twenty years hence, as many shops for Australian butter and American wheat as we have today for our own ghee and wheat?
('38', 297, 1, 3, 604699) If it is patriotic enough to buy foreign cloth because it is cheaper or more pleasant to the eye, why will it not be patriotic enough, when that time comes, to buy cheaper foreign butter and foreign wheat, even though our ghee manufacturers and wheat growers may become idle and starve for want of other occupations to take the place of the lost ones?
('38', 297, 1, 4, 605051) These are reflections presented for the edification of wearers of foreign cloth.
('38', 297, 1, 5, 605132) But what is the lesson these stores teach us, khadi organisers?
('38', 297, 1, 6, 605196) In my opinion, by honest and able organization, we can create a universal demand for khadi, (a) if those who are engaged in khadi production will pay attention to the manufacture of stronger and more even yarn equal at least to the mill spun yarn; (b) if they will also study the tastes of the people and produce sufficient variety of khadi; (c) if by efficiency in other directions they bring down the price of khadi; (d) if those who are engaged in the distribution of khadi will gain greater knowledge of the tastes of the people and will learn the art of selling; (e) if both the producers and the sellers will realize that they must give the maximum of efficiency with the minimum of wages and that self sacrifice is the one imperative condition of successful organiza tion of khadi on a universal basis.
('38', 297, 1, 7, 606006) I note that private depots assume names after their owners or some other name.
('38', 297, 1, 8, 606085) For greater convenience, I would suggest their having one namesimple Khadi Bhandar or Vastralaya, with A.I.S.A. or Congress or Private as the case may be in parenthesis.
('38', 297, 1, 9, 606255) Where there are more than one in the same place they may have consecutive numbers.
('38', 297, 1, 10, 606338) This is desirable so long as khadi has to be organized and nursed and so long as the various depots are either directly owned by the A.I.S.A. or are certified by and affiliated to it.

('38', 298, 3, 7, 606831) Personally I am averse to ornamental list of anything.
('38', 298, 3, 8, 606886) The sooner we get out of this habit the better for us.

('38', 298, 9, 16, 607401) MIRA, I have your four letters of which three were received together yesterday.
('38', 298, 9, 17, 607481) You must have got the wire of departure sent to you from Belgaum on 19th.
('38', 298, 9, 18, 607555) One of your letters yesterday prompted me to send you a peremptory wire asking you to come to Nandi.
('38', 298, 9, 19, 607656) But I restrained myself.
('38', 298, 9, 20, 607681) The other two letters were less gloomy.
('38', 298, 9, 21, 607721) But even so, if the separation becomes unbearable, you must come without waiting for an answer or any prompting from me.
('38', 298, 9, 22, 607842) The love of the people round you should really strengthen you and keep you there.
('38', 298, 9, 23, 607924) Your letter describing the affection of the people there is most touching and it

('38', 299, 0, 1, 608104) 300 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 299, 1, 2, 608146) would be a matter for sorrow if you cannot be at peace with yourself there.
('38', 299, 1, 3, 608222) But no one can suddenly change ones nature and if your effort to compose yourself there becomes fruitless, you should tell the friends there so plainly and come away here without the slightest hesitation.
('38', 299, 1, 4, 608427) On no account should there be a breakdown there.
('38', 299, 1, 5, 608476) You must not try your nerves to the breaking point.
('38', 299, 1, 6, 608528) This is the sixth day here.
('38', 299, 1, 7, 608556) I am not yet acclimatized.
('38', 299, 1, 8, 608583) I have not retained the energy and the strength I felt at Amboli, but doctors assure me that Nandi must in the end be more beneficial than Amboli.
('38', 299, 1, 9, 608730) They say that this is an ideal place for blood pressure men.
('38', 299, 1, 10, 608791) There is no cause whatsoever for worry or anxiety.
('38', 299, 1, 11, 608842) Since you were so worried about the forgetfulness about the two fasts, it was well that you fasted.
('38', 299, 1, 12, 608942) 1 There is no doubt that fasting is a good thing even physically whenever there is a nervous strain.
('38', 299, 1, 13, 609043) It would certainly have been well, if I had fasted before the collapse came.
('38', 299, 1, 14, 609120) The strain of that day was terrific.
('38', 299, 1, 15, 609157) But this is wisdom after the event.
('38', 299, 1, 16, 609193) We may profit by that stupid mistake of mine.
('38', 299, 1, 17, 609239) I call it stupid because I was aware of the strain and of the merit of fasting in such circumstances.
('38', 299, 1, 18, 609341) But the Devil is ever after us and catches us at our weakest.
('38', 299, 1, 19, 609403) He found me weak and wanting and trapped me.
('38', 299, 1, 20, 609448) Your fast therefore does not worry me.
('38', 299, 1, 21, 609487) Only you will know when to take it and how to take it.
('38', 299, 1, 22, 609542) You must develop iron nerves.

('38', 300, 5, 17, 610737) ASHRAM, SABARMATI, 1
('38', 300, 6, 18, 610758) April 25, 1927 I have your letter of the 29th March.
('38', 300, 6, 19, 610811) I must dictate this letter as I must keep as much on my back as possible.
('38', 300, 6, 20, 610885) I see you want me to give you the name of an Indian friend who could lay the foundation stone for your new hall.
('38', 300, 6, 21, 610998) The only one I can think of and thoroughly recommend and whom I know personally very well is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
('38', 300, 6, 22, 611116) His address is: Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Clinique Stephani, Montanas Sierre, Switzerland.
('38', 300, 6, 23, 611206) And you must write to him.
('38', 300, 6, 24, 611233) Use this letter and draw him.
('38', 300, 6, 25, 611263) He will come if you want him and you will be pleased to have him.
('38', 300, 6, 26, 611329) He is one of the truest men I know in India.
('38', 300, 6, 27, 611374) I am writing to him.
('38', 300, 6, 28, 611395) I do not like your resolution at all.
('38', 300, 6, 29, 611433) Here is the text that I would recommend.
('38', 300, 6, 30, 611474) I know it will be difficult for you to pilot my text.
('38', 300, 6, 31, 611528) But really that alone will answer if it is backed by corresponding action.
('38', 300, 6, 32, 611603) The resolution you have given is very vague and will be accepted by the Government of India without any difficulty.
('38', 300, 6, 33, 611719) For, they will say that they do not thwart any action which the Indian people by their accredited representatives may desire to carry through.
('38', 300, 6, 34, 611862) They will say, we have transferred this department to them.
('38', 300, 6, 35, 611922) Let them adjust the finances as they like. Do you see what I mean?

('38', 301, 0, 1, 612030) 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 301, 1, 2, 612072) Government is not sincere, that the people have really no hand in the matter, and that the transfer of excise revenue to the elected representatives is itself proof of the Governments insincerity.
('38', 301, 1, 3, 612269) Edu cation is a transferred subject and the financial assistance given to them is from the excise revenue.
('38', 301, 1, 4, 612376) The Government have thus created a tie.
('38', 301, 1, 5, 612416) If the accredited representatives shut up liquor shops, they must starve education or impose fresh taxation upon a people who are in no way able to bear the weight even of existing taxation.
('38', 301, 1, 6, 612607) The remedy, therefore, is, if the position stated above is correct, for the Government to keep the excise department themselves and carry the prohibition policy through and recoup themselves for the loss of revenue by cutting down the military budget.
('38', 301, 1, 7, 612859) They have as much right to raise revenue through liquor as they would have to raise revenue through legalized prostitution.
('38', 301, 1, 8, 612983) If this is your position independently of me and if you can support the position by your own study of facts, figures and other literature, your resolution would run thus: In the opinion of this meeting it is wrong for the people of this country to be party to the maintenance of the liquor traffic in India and that therefore it was wrong on the part of the Government to have made the liquor revenue of India a transferred (provincial) subject and consequently a principal source of revenue on which the spending departments of education and development have to depend, thereby rendering it practically impossible for the Ministers responsible for these departments to undertake a policy of prohibition.
('38', 301, 1, 9, 613688) In the opinion of this meeting the Government of India should have retained the Liquor Revenue as a Central subject and carried out a policy of complete prohibition, the loss of revenue thus sustained being made up for, by retrenchment in the ever growing and largely unnecessary military expenditure.
('38', 301, 1, 10, 613990) This meeting therefore calls upon the Government to take the steps necessary to enforce the wish expressed in this resolution.
('38', 301, 1, 11, 614117) You may lick the resolution into shape in any manner you like so long as you retain the substance of it unimpaired.
('38', 301, 1, 12, 614233) I fear that you will find it difficult to carry through the resolution of this character.
('38', 301, 1, 13, 614323) But really it is the only thing worth having.
('38', 301, 1, 14, 614369) And if you find that there is no atmosphere yet in England for such a drastic resolutionand I admit that it is drasticmerely put your case before the educated public, and wait for the resolution.

('38', 302, 6, 12, 615239) The replies you have given to various people are all right.

('38', 302, 6, 14, 615385) I shall write to Bhai Shankerlal about the suggestion from Dastane.
('38', 302, 6, 15, 615453) I am not at all satisfied with the accounts of the dairy.
('38', 302, 6, 16, 615511) There are 21 errors and we must not pass over them.
('38', 302, 6, 17, 615563) Please revise the accounts and let me have the figures.
('38', 302, 6, 18, 615619) Go to Parnerkar and draw his attention to these errors.
('38', 302, 6, 19, 615675) If Maganlal has come there, have another discussion with him.
('38', 302, 6, 20, 615737) How could so many mistakes and such grave ones escape his notice ?
('38', 302, 6, 21, 615804) Even if they were not grave, their number is certainly alarming.
('38', 302, 6, 22, 615869) When you send me the revised figures, put the wrong ones alongside.

('38', 303, 4, 7, 616414) My own reason refuses to work in this matter.
('38', 303, 4, 8, 616460) You may there fore use your reason and come to a decision leaving the responsibility to me.
('38', 303, 4, 9, 616552) About Gariyadhar, do what you think best on the whole.
('38', 303, 4, 10, 616607) As regards the Panch Talavadi matter, if your reason does not approve of either Maneklal or Chhaganlal, pay them their due salaries and ask them to stand on their own feet.
('38', 303, 4, 11, 616780) About Vajeram, do what you think proper.

('38', 304, 9, 21, 618698) Or is it because there is confusion in your Mandal for want of a new presi dent, even as chaos may prevail in a country when there is no king?

('38', 306, 3, 8, 620720) I wish everything is settled amicably.
('38', 306, 3, 9, 620759) I am at the moment concerned about the safety of our persons and property.
('38', 306, 3, 10, 620834) I think it is not right for us to hire the services of a watchman.
('38', 306, 3, 11, 620901) I can understand having paid assistants from outside the Ashram for other jobs.
('38', 306, 3, 12, 620981) But just as we have to offer our own prayers so we shall achieve our aim only when we are able to take care of ourselves.
('38', 306, 3, 13, 621103) Or we shall have to have recourse to the practice [of employing watchmen], in which case our experiments with truth and non violence would suffer.
('38', 306, 3, 14, 621250) We cannot have a watchman who commits violence [against the intruders] nor can we let him suffer violence [at their hands].
('38', 306, 3, 15, 621374) If there is to be violence we should inflict it ourselves and also suffer it ourselves.
('38', 306, 3, 16, 621462) Women and children too should acquire this strength.
('38', 306, 3, 17, 621515) Just see what an absurd result we get if we visualize a magnified picture of the reports that have reached me.

('38', 306, 3, 19, 621739) The East India Company built fortresses and employed mercenaries simply because they had to submit to the circumstances.

('38', 306, 3, 21, 621937) I think we should train workers who would keep an all night vigil.
('38', 306, 3, 22, 622004) They will have to think of some means of winning over the thieves without having to act in a way contrary to dharma.

('38', 306, 3, 30, 622546) We ought to know who the intruders were this time.

('38', 307, 4, 18, 623992) Ours is an absolutely unique way.

('38', 308, 6, 10, 624831) NANDI HILLS, MYSORE, April 26, 1927
('38', 308, 7, 11, 624867) DEAR KSHITISH BABU, Though I have not written to you during my illness, I have often thought of you and the Pratishthan.
('38', 308, 7, 12, 624988) I am getting on fairly well and can do a moderate amount of letter writing, etc.
('38', 308, 7, 13, 625069) Do please tell me how you are getting on and how the climate of Sodepur agrees with the workers there.
('38', 308, 7, 14, 625172) I send you an extract from Mirabais letter about the travelling charkha.
('38', 308, 7, 15, 625245) I too have found the parts to be weak.
('38', 308, 7, 16, 625284) It will be no disadvantage if it is made stronger even though the weight increases a bit.
('38', 308, 7, 17, 625374) The axle bearings should be metallic and the uprights should undoubtedly be strong.
('38', 308, 7, 18, 625458) The spokes too should be more rigid than they are.
('38', 308, 7, 19, 625509) However, you will see what can be and should be done.
('38', 308, 7, 20, 625563) Mirabai is a most thoughtful worker.
('38', 308, 7, 21, 625600) Her well meant criticism should be taken for what it is worth.
('38', 308, 8, 22, 625663) Yours sincerely,

('38', 308, 11, 24, 625708) 311. LETTER TO R. B. GREGG
('38', 308, 12, 25, 625735) NANDI HILLS, April 26, 1927
('38', 308, 13, 26, 625763) MY DEAR GOVIND, Do not be alarmed.
('38', 308, 13, 27, 625798) Though I reply to your letter so promptly, it is not by way of courtesy, but for pleasure; for, I do not yield to you
('38', 309, 0, 1, 625916) 310 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 309, 1, 2, 625958) in my zeal for dietetic reform.
('38', 309, 1, 3, 625990) Only my lot having been during the last 20 years cast in a rigid mould, I have not been able to wriggle out of it in spite of my intense desire to prosecute dietetic research.
('38', 309, 1, 4, 626166) But now that nature had laid me low, the appetite which was never eradicated, but was only under suppression, has become active and I go for everything in this direction with avidity.
('38', 309, 1, 5, 626350) Now to the point.
('38', 309, 1, 6, 626368) For the last two days I have made one impor tant change prompted by a fellow crank.
('38', 309, 1, 7, 626452) He suggested my taking the juice of fresh neem leaves by mixing it with milk.
('38', 309, 1, 8, 626530) He says my case is not one of blood pressure but of flatulence.
('38', 309, 1, 9, 626594) Blood pressure there certainly is; but I am inclined to agree with this friend, that blood pressure is a temporary effect of flatulence which is the root cause, and he thinks I could deal with the latter by taking the juice of neem leaves with my meals.
('38', 309, 1, 10, 626848) These leaves are bitter.
('38', 309, 1, 11, 626873) He says they contain the necessary vitamins.
('38', 309, 1, 12, 626918) I am watching their effect now.
('38', 309, 1, 13, 626950) Your letter was received yesterday and the change I have made today is to take unboiled milk.
('38', 309, 1, 14, 627044) This was suggested by some medical friends at Amboli.
('38', 309, 1, 15, 627098) But I was not responsive.
('38', 309, 1, 16, 627124) But your letter has evoked the necessary response.
('38', 309, 1, 17, 627175) My hosts have brought some goats on to this hill and they are milked under supervision.
('38', 309, 1, 18, 627263) Milk was therefore brought this morning fresh from the udders.
('38', 309, 1, 19, 627326) It was mixed with neem leaves juice and hot raisin water was added to the milk.
('38', 309, 1, 20, 627406) This in accordance with your letter gives me the vitamins from the milk and in accor dance with that friend gives me the vitamins from the neem leaves.
('38', 309, 1, 21, 627558) I am therefore at the present moment omitting fresh vegetables because I am not yet satisfied that these vegetables are necessary especially as I am taking those bitter leaves and unboiled milk.
('38', 309, 1, 22, 627753) At what point are vitamins destroyed when you boil leafy vegetables ?
('38', 309, 1, 23, 627823) What is the virtue of vitamins?
('38', 309, 1, 24, 627855) What is the quantity of leafy vegetables one should take in order to get the required measure of vitamins?
('38', 309, 1, 25, 627962) What quantity of unboiled milk will give the vitamins required?
('38', 309, 1, 26, 628026) Is it true that mere heating the milk does not destroy vitamins?
('38', 309, 1, 27, 628091) Or they are only des troyed when milk is brought to the boiling point?
('38', 309, 1, 28, 628162) I have tried the nuts in the manner you suggest.
('38', 309, 1, 29, 628211) I had them reduced to butter.
('38', 309, 1, 30, 628241) The pulp was as fine as butter.
('38', 309, 1, 31, 628273) I had almonds turned into milk.
('38', 309, 1, 32, 628305) But I could not cope with it, no matter how far you pulverized the nuts.
('38', 309, 1, 33, 628378) They must, it appears, pass through the double process of digestion like all non flesh foods.
('38', 309, 1, 34, 628472) It is only animal food which does not tax the large intestines.
('38', 309, 1, 35, 628536) Before nuts, therefore, can
('38', 310, 0, 1, 628564) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 311
('38', 310, 1, 2, 628607) attain the digestibility of milk, the first process of digestion must be gone through outside the human system.
('38', 310, 1, 3, 628719) I was told when I was in London, that melted nuts had that effect.
('38', 310, 1, 4, 628786) I do not know how far this is true.
('38', 310, 1, 5, 628822) I want to succeed in non milk experiment because I am convinced that milk, apart from mothers milk, is not human food, nor is cooking essential.
('38', 310, 1, 6, 628967) A perfect food therefore for human needs has yet to be found.
('38', 310, 1, 7, 629029) From the spiritual stand point, I have a horror of animal milk, and that it is goats milk I am taking does not lessen the horror.
('38', 310, 1, 8, 629159) It merely enables me to respect the letter of my vow, though I know that the spirit of it is hardly kept if not already broken.
('38', 310, 1, 9, 629287) I have reconciled myself to goats milk under the delusive belief that I must have for my work on the earth in this body and so I cling to it at the expense of my innermost conviction.
('38', 310, 1, 10, 629471) He, therefore, who can wean me from milk, will be in a way a deliverer.
('38', 310, 1, 11, 629543) There are spiritual experiences which I know have been interrupted because of my taking milk.
('38', 310, 1, 12, 629637) When I was living rigidly on sun baked fruits and sun baked nuts without using fire and this was for several yearsthe animal passion was not merely under conscious subjection and control, but it was, so far as my memory serves me, thoroughly absent and I believe that I had almost entirely conquered it.
('38', 310, 1, 13, 629941) All that has been changed since my return to milk diet.
('38', 310, 1, 14, 629997) I can no longer claim that immunity.
('38', 310, 1, 15, 630034) I can only say in all humility that though I am conscious of that passion, I can keep it under subjection and appear before the world a respectable human being from whose lust no woman need fear.
('38', 310, 1, 16, 630230) But it cost me all my strength to keep the brute in me under disciplined subjection and control.
('38', 310, 1, 17, 630327) I am positive that a full grown man does not need all that effort to keep his passions under check.
('38', 310, 1, 18, 630427) On the contrary, the energy that set free when the passions are kept under control can, if he wishes, be transferred into unconquerable power for the good of mankind.
('38', 310, 1, 19, 630594) But somehow or other, I fancy that I shall never attain that freedom, that personal swaraj, so long as I have to struggle against the effect of the highly exciting unnatural food; whereas, nuts are fine muscle builders without being stimulants in the sense in which I have used them.
('38', 310, 1, 20, 630878) Now you can understand why I reply to your letter so promptly.
('38', 310, 1, 21, 630941) It is a great pity that you have not yet got rid of your piles.
('38', 310, 1, 22, 631005) No mere dietetic change will give you relief.
('38', 310, 1, 23, 631051) Medicine will be only a palliative.
('38', 310, 1, 24, 631087) I am making explorations into which I must not enter now, because, I am merely on the threshold of them.
('38', 310, 1, 25, 631192) I am collecting round me friends who have experimented.
('38', 310, 1, 26, 631248) I shall give you a report if I see

('38', 311, 1, 2, 631325) any signs of real success.
('38', 311, 1, 3, 631352) It hurts me however to think that you did not have an operation for want of means.
('38', 311, 1, 4, 631435) Dr. Ansari is a first class surgeon.
('38', 311, 1, 5, 631472) I could send a note to him if you dont know him.
('38', 311, 1, 6, 631521) He will, I am sure, gladly perform the operation and put you either in his own house or in some place where you will have to pay nothing.
('38', 311, 1, 7, 631659) You could also have the operation performed by one of the cleverest of surgeons in India, that is, Dr. Dalal in Bombay.
('38', 311, 1, 8, 631779) There are not one but more than one hospitals that I know will admit you with greatest pleasure.
('38', 311, 1, 9, 631876) You may not know that Dr. Dalal operated on me, Devdas, Mrs. Jamnalalji and, last but not the least, Andrews.
('38', 311, 1, 10, 631986) You have only to let me know what arrangements you would like and they shall be made.
('38', 311, 1, 11, 632072) Do not hesitate please to write to me of your discoveries about the spinning wheel and machinery.
('38', 311, 1, 12, 632170) Of course I am interested in your scholastic researches, and, as a matter of fact, this enforced rest gives me just the time to read letters and to reflect upon topics in which both you and I are interested.
('38', 311, 1, 13, 632378) From the length of the dictated letter you can infer that I am not badly off though I need to lie on my back as much as possible.
('38', 311, 1, 14, 632508) There is no difficulty about dictating letters and even sitting up for a time to write as I did yesterday, it being my silence day.
('38', 311, 1, 15, 632640) With love to you all, Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI R. B. GREGG, ESQ.

('38', 312, 1, 4, 633408) If we wish to deal with it ourselves, we will have to make arrangement for lights.
('38', 312, 1, 5, 633491) In that case, we have no option but to have the electricity.
('38', 312, 1, 6, 633552) It is the cheapest source and is our .
('38', 312, 1, 7, 633591) 1 We have to use the engine for water and perhaps the same may be used for electric lights.
('38', 312, 1, 8, 633683) For the protection of the guards, we will have to make special arrangement.
('38', 312, 1, 9, 633759) The situation remains the same even if we ourselves do the work of guards.
('38', 312, 1, 10, 633834) We have taken up so many activities here that we cannot do without taking steps for their protection or we will have to wind up all the activites....

('38', 312, 2, 12, 634065) I am not able to take any decision on behalf of everyone.
('38', 312, 2, 13, 634123) One man alone cannot do that.
('38', 312, 2, 14, 634153) Whatever decision you all take jointly will be the best.
('38', 312, 2, 15, 634210) I will only say that it is necessary for us to take a prompt decision in the matter.

('38', 313, 1, 3, 635195) Please let me know the various aspects of the situation.
('38', 313, 1, 4, 635252) I have forwarded to Chi.
('38', 313, 1, 5, 635277) Chhaganlal the letter about funds for the school, asking him to send the amount as and when possible.
('38', 313, 1, 6, 635379) 1 I also understand from your letter that you have no intention of coming under the Vidyapith and that, if your present requirements are met with, you will later on manage yourself somehow.
('38', 313, 1, 7, 635569) I have been writing to Narandas about the khadi work.
('38', 313, 1, 8, 635623) Now about the Satyagraha Dal.
('38', 313, 1, 9, 635653) There will never be too many satyagrahis; my blessings therefore even to those who would try to become one.
('38', 313, 1, 10, 635761) But are we likely to gain any special advantage by forming a Dal?
('38', 313, 1, 11, 635827) There could be recruiting for an immediate task on hand.
('38', 313, 1, 12, 635884) Will the Dal be useful as a stand by when an occasion comes up?
('38', 313, 1, 13, 635948) Or if we have such an organi zation, it should, I am convinced by experience, be engaged in some constructive activity.
('38', 313, 1, 14, 636068) In the event of a struggle, we can draw from it the required number of workers and the rest can come and join of their own accord.
('38', 313, 1, 15, 636199) What will these 18 persons do as long as there is no occasion to launch a struggle?
('38', 313, 1, 16, 636283) Of course they do carry on their spinning; when I speak of constructive activity I mean that which would keep them occupied all the time.
('38', 313, 1, 17, 636421) All these 18 persons have their own business to attend to.
('38', 313, 1, 18, 636480) At the moment they have no social activity to take up collectively.
('38', 313, 1, 19, 636548) Who will build up faultless character?
('38', 313, 1, 20, 636587) How is it defined?
('38', 313, 1, 21, 636606) You for one know well that the Satyagraha Ashram exists just for it.
('38', 313, 1, 22, 636675) And even there, who could certify faultless character?
('38', 313, 1, 23, 636730) Satyagraha and the satyagrahis are like the sun and its rays, you cannot hide them under a bushel, they cannot be unmade by your refusing to recognize them.
('38', 313, 1, 24, 636887) Everywhere today I see occasions for satyagraha; but where are those who would offer it?
('38', 313, 1, 25, 636976) Those that would are ever ready.
('38', 313, 1, 26, 637009) They are preparing themselves and when they have the confidence they will never wait for my permission or anyone elses.
('38', 313, 1, 27, 637129) In spite of all this cautioning, I would ask you to let all that you have done stand as it is.
('38', 313, 1, 28, 637224) It would not have mattered had you not worked it up, but where the intention is noble there is no room for disappointment or for undoing what has been done.

('38', 314, 1, 3, 637540) As for my criticism in the first instance you should think it over yourself and then make such additions and alterations as you think right.
('38', 314, 1, 4, 637681) When we meet we shall again discuss it further.
('38', 314, 1, 5, 637729) This Dal is certainly not in response to those who are pressing us to take up political activity.
('38', 314, 1, 6, 637827) Their point of view too deserves to be understood.
('38', 314, 1, 7, 637878) It is a different thing that you and I are not interested in it.
('38', 314, 1, 8, 637943) They maintain that even today we should carry on a movement, as far as we can, over all the issues that are believed to have a political aspect.
('38', 314, 1, 9, 638088) Satyagraha may or may not come off, but let us at least present a petition regarding our present miseries.
('38', 314, 1, 10, 638195) If nothing more, let us come together for discussions since we are allowed to.
('38', 314, 1, 11, 638274) If nothing else, let us at any rate exchange views and so on.
('38', 314, 1, 12, 638336) This line of thought cannot certainly be dismissed; we too had been thinking this way in the past.
('38', 314, 1, 13, 638435) Your Dal does not answer this expectation.
('38', 314, 1, 14, 638478) You should find out some simple way for them, or help them find it.
('38', 314, 1, 15, 638546) One of the ways to do this is to willingly leave the organization of the Political Conference to them and help them with it as much as you can.
('38', 314, 1, 16, 638690) As I write, more comes to my pen.
('38', 314, 1, 17, 638724) But if I set out to print all of it I would tire my hand and my doctor will warn me that my blood pressure may rise.
('38', 314, 1, 18, 638841) You should therefore strike the ts and dot the is in what I have written today.
('38', 314, 1, 19, 638921) And if you cannot, you should get me to do it on some other occasion.

('38', 315, 3, 4, 639207) BHAISHRI MAMA, I have your letter.
('38', 315, 3, 5, 639242) It appears the Godhra Ashram has at present a good number of students.
('38', 315, 3, 6, 639313) But then you also could be said to have done good work.
('38', 315, 3, 7, 639369) You must have noticed however that the Ashram children did more spinning in that way.
('38', 315, 3, 8, 639455) Did you read Ramachan drans report of Jamia Millia?
('38', 315, 3, 9, 639507) It may be said the boys there did absolutely no spinning for six years.
('38', 315, 3, 10, 639579) Just a knowledgeable, affectionate teacher who had faith in it has changed the entire atmosphere of the Ashram.
('38', 315, 3, 11, 639691) Many such stories come to me.
('38', 315, 3, 12, 639721) I do not write all this as criticism of you but only to strengthen your faith if I may.
('38', 315, 3, 13, 639809) But I do not want to tell you things, I want to hear what you have to say.
('38', 315, 3, 14, 639884) How do you feel about Ramanandjis work?
('38', 315, 3, 15, 639924) What about that of the Punjab?
('38', 315, 3, 16, 639955) Did you cope with that task?
('38', 315, 3, 17, 639984) Everyone believes I should be all right.
('38', 315, 3, 18, 640025) The doctors here say that I have no illness as such, but that I must have long rest.
('38', 315, 3, 19, 640110) The weather here is fine.
('38', 315, 3, 20, 640136) The view cannot compare with the one at Chin chpokli.
('38', 315, 3, 21, 640190) If it were your responsibility, what would you do about the nuisance of prowlers round the Ashram?
('38', 315, 3, 22, 640289) Think long before you answer.

('38', 316, 3, 4, 640521) MIRA, I have your cheerful letter.
('38', 316, 3, 5, 640556) If you can realize every word of what you have written, all your trouble is over and also my anxiety.
('38', 316, 3, 6, 640658) We really live through and in our work.
('38', 316, 3, 7, 640698) We perish through our perishable bodies, if instead of using them as temporary instruments, we identify ourselves with them.
('38', 316, 3, 8, 640823) The more I observe and study things, the more convinced I become that sorrow over separation and death is perhaps the greatest delusion.
('38', 316, 3, 9, 640960) To realize that it is a delusion is to become free.
('38', 316, 3, 10, 641012) There is no death, no separation of the substance.
('38', 316, 3, 11, 641063) And yet the tragedy of it is that though we love friends for the substance we recognize in them, we deplore the destruction of the insubstantial that covers the substance for the time being.
('38', 316, 3, 12, 641254) Whereas real friendship should be used to reach the whole through the fragment.
('38', 316, 3, 13, 641334) You seem to have got the truth for the moment.
('38', 316, 3, 14, 641381) Let it abide for ever.
('38', 316, 4, 15, 641404) I do not know how Krishnanandji came to think that I was coming there in June.
('38', 316, 4, 16, 641483) What I did sayI think in letter was that I would like to come as early as I could.
('38', 316, 4, 17, 641566) I note your warning.
('38', 316, 4, 18, 641587) There is little chance of my being able to leave the place before June, if then.

('38', 317, 10, 21, 643162) A correspondent from Mahad writes:
('38', 317, 11, 22, 643197) It gives me much sorrow to let you know that there was a riot on the 20th of March last between touchables and untouchables at Mahad.
('38', 317, 11, 23, 643331) There was held a conference of the Colaba District depressed classes on the 19th and 20th ultimo.
('38', 317, 11, 24, 643429) The meeting was quite successful.
('38', 317, 11, 25, 643463) But whilst the crowd was dispersing, Mr. A. V. Chitre of the Social Service League of Bombay told the people as they were thirsty and as the sun was very hot that they could go to the public tank and drink water.
('38', 317, 11, 26, 643676) There were some who tried to dissuade the men from going to the tank.
('38', 317, 11, 27, 643746) But Dr. Ambedkar the president decided to march the men to the tank.
('38', 317, 11, 28, 643815) Even the police inspector could not feel the gravity of the situation, and instead of stopping the crowd from proceeding to the tank, went with them.
('38', 317, 11, 29, 643965) The tank is situated in the midst of the Brahmin locality.
('38', 317, 11, 30, 644024) As however no

('38', 318, 1, 2, 644176) one was aware that the untouchables were going to the tank there was no disturbance, and hundreds of them quenched their thirst at the tank with cries of Hara Hara Mahadev.
('38', 318, 1, 3, 644349) Meanwhile the touchables came to the scene and they
('38', 318, 2, 4, 644401) watched the incident with rage.
('38', 318, 2, 5, 644433) The crowd of untouchables then went back to the pandal for their meals.
('38', 318, 2, 6, 644505) Within an hour of this the Mahad public was suddenly awakened by the wild cry Gurava and they were told that the
('38', 318, 3, 7, 644618) untouchables were thinking of entering the temple of Vireshwar.
('38', 318, 4, 8, 644682) It was a false cry; but in no time the temple was filled by an infuriated mob of touchables who had sticks in their hands.
('38', 318, 4, 9, 644805) The poor untouchables had no intention whatsoever of going to the temple.
('38', 318, 4, 10, 644879) But the touchables finding no untouchable attempting to enter the temple practically ran amuck, went to the bazaar and began to beat any untouchable they came across in the street.
('38', 318, 4, 11, 645060) All the while this beating was going on on the part of the touchables, not one untouchable offered any resistance.
('38', 318, 4, 12, 645175) A few touchables who sympathized with the untouchables tried to protect them; but the furious mob would not be checked.
('38', 318, 4, 13, 645295) They even rushed into the huts of shoe makers and such others and beat them severely.
('38', 318, 4, 14, 645381) The helpless untouchables ran wildly for help; but none was offered by the shopkeepers.
('38', 318, 4, 15, 645469) The untouchables who were in the pandal were derided by the touchables for not coming out in the open to fight.
('38', 318, 4, 16, 645581) There were nearly 1,500 of the former in the pandal and if they had offered to fight there would have been a great calamity and Hinduism would have been disgraced.
('38', 318, 4, 17, 645745) Dr. Ambedkar justified the advice that he had given on the strength of the resolution that was passed in the Bombay Legislative Council and on the opinion expressed by the Mahad Municipality that the untouchables were lawfully entitled to take water from public tanks and wells.
('38', 318, 4, 18, 646024) I have omitted from the correspondents letter several passages giving further details.
('38', 318, 4, 19, 646111) But the letter appears to me to be genuine and does not in any way appear to be an over estimate.
('38', 318, 4, 20, 646209) Assuming then that the incident is correctly reported there can be no question about the unprovoked lawlessness on the part of the so called higher classes.
('38', 318, 4, 21, 646366) For, it should be remembered that it was not the drinking of water at the tank which had brought together the touchables to the temple but the false report that the untouchables were wanting to enter the temple.
('38', 318, 4, 22, 646578) But one can hardly expect sanity to exist side by side with unreason.
('38', 318, 4, 23, 646648) Untouchability itself has no reason behind it.
('38', 318, 4, 24, 646695) It is an inhuman institution.
('38', 318, 4, 25, 646725) It is tottering and it is sought to be supported by the so called orthodox party by sheer brute force.
('38', 318, 4, 26, 646828) The so called untouchables have brought the question a step nearer solution by their exemplary self restraint under most provo

('38', 319, 1, 3, 647018) Had they retaliated it would have been perhaps difficult to distribute the blame.
('38', 319, 1, 4, 647100) As it is, the blame is all on the side of the touchables.
('38', 319, 1, 5, 647158) Brute force will not sustain untouch ability.
('38', 319, 1, 6, 647204) It will bring about a revulsion of feeling in favour of the suppressed classes.
('38', 319, 1, 7, 647284) It is a sign of the times that there were at least some touchables who tried to defend the poor untouchables.
('38', 319, 1, 8, 647394) One could wish that there were many more in Mahad.
('38', 319, 1, 9, 647445) Silent sympathy on such occasions is not of much use.
('38', 319, 1, 10, 647499) Every Hindu, who considers the removal of untouch ability to be of paramount importance, should on such occasions prove his sympathy by publicly defending the suppressed classes and having his own head broken in defending the helpless and the down trodden.
('38', 319, 1, 11, 647756) I cannot help thinking that Dr. Ambedkar was fully justified in putting to test the resolutions of the Bombay Legislative Council and the Mahad Municipality by advising the so called untouchables to go to the tank to quench their thirst.
('38', 319, 1, 12, 647994) No incident of this character should pass by unnoticed on the part of associations like the Hindu Maha sabha interested in this reform.
('38', 319, 1, 13, 648130) Let them investigate the statements made by my correspondent and if they can be substantiated, let them condemn the action of the touchables.
('38', 319, 1, 14, 648272) There is nothing like the growth of enlightened public opinion for eradicating everything evil, which untouchability undoubtedly is.

('38', 319, 4, 17, 648460) Very considerable relief will be felt by the Indian settlers in South Africa over the announcement that the Right Honble V. S. Srinivasa Sastri has consented to become Indias first Agent general in that sub continent, if the post is finally offered to him by the Government of India.
('38', 319, 4, 18, 648744) It is a great sacrifice that Sastri and the Servants of India Society have made.
('38', 319, 4, 19, 648825) It is an open secret that left to himself he was not inclined to undertake the responsibility and to leave his work in India.
('38', 319, 4, 20, 648951) But he has yielded to the pressure of friends, especially when it was urged upon him that he alone could successfully inaugurate the working of the Agreement in bringing about which he played not an inconsiderable part.
('38', 319, 4, 21, 649171) We know from the cables that were sent from time to time from South Africa that the Europeans were anxious that he should accept the honour.
('38', 319, 4, 22, 649312) Srinivasa Sastri had by his eloquence,
('38', 320, 0, 1, 649351) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 321
('38', 320, 1, 2, 649394) transparent sincerity, sweet reasonableness, and extreme earnestness won the esteem and respect of the Union Government and the Europeans in South Africa during the short time that he was there as a member of the Habibullah Deputation.
('38', 320, 1, 3, 649630) I know how nervously anxious our countrymen in South Africa were that he should become the first Agent.
('38', 320, 1, 4, 649734) It was impossible for Sjt.
('38', 320, 1, 5, 649761) Srinivasa Sastri whom God has endowed with a generous nature not to respond to such a unanimous call from South Africa.
('38', 320, 1, 6, 649881) It is almost a foregone conclusion that the appointment will be duly made and very shortly announced.
('38', 320, 1, 7, 649983) The first Agent general will have his work cut out for him.
('38', 320, 1, 8, 650043) Both the Union Government and our countrymen have no doubt high expectations of Indias first ambassador.
('38', 320, 1, 9, 650148) The Union Government no doubt think that being an Indian and a person of great distinction he will make their path smooth with the Indian community in connection with any measures that they may take.
('38', 320, 1, 10, 650348) In other words, they will expect him to be their sympathetic interpreter both to the Indian community and to the Government of India.
('38', 320, 1, 11, 650482) Our countrymen equally surely expect him to insist upon an honourable and even a liberal inter pretation and fulfilment of the Agreement.
('38', 320, 1, 12, 650620) It is any time a delicate task to please rival claimants, more so now in South Africa where the clash of conflicting interests is simply bewildering.
('38', 320, 1, 13, 650770) But I know that if anybody can hold the scales absolutely even and thus give satisfaction to all parties concerned, Sjt.
('38', 320, 1, 14, 650891) Srinivas Sastri is certainly the one to be able to do so.
('38', 320, 1, 15, 650949) I feel certain that the Union Ministers do not expect the new Agent to surrender an inch of what is justly due to the Indian community.
('38', 320, 1, 16, 651085) All he can be expected to do is to persuade the Indian settlers not to go behind and travel beyond the Settlement 1 of 1914, for some time to come at any rate, until they have proved themselves entitled, by exemplary self restraint and behaviour, to an enlargement of the position attained by the Agreement of 1914. Our countrymen in South Africa, if they intend to make the Agents position fairly easy and their own position secure, will not expect him to work wonders.
('38', 320, 1, 17, 651556) It will be wrong to look forward to a complete transfor mation of the old position, because an honourable Agreement has been arrived at and because a great countryman is going to South Africa to see to the fulfilment of that Agreement.
('38', 320, 1, 18, 651792) They must remem ber that the Rt.
('38', 320, 1, 19, 651825) Srinivasa Sastri is not going there as their counsel briefed to attend to every individual grievance.

('38', 321, 1, 2, 652042) detailed individual grievances would be to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
('38', 321, 1, 3, 652127) He goes there as a trustee for Indias honour.
('38', 321, 1, 4, 652173) He goes there to safeguard the rights and liberty of the general body of Indian settlers.
('38', 321, 1, 5, 652263) He will be there to see that no fresh restrictive legislation is embarked upon by the Union Government and that the existing restrictive laws are administered liberally and with due regard to the vested rights.
('38', 321, 1, 6, 652474) Any individual grievance therefore that he might be called upon to tackle will have to be in terms of the position I have set forth, that is to say, it will have to be illustrative of some general principle of wide application.
('38', 321, 1, 7, 652702) Unless therefore the Indian community exercises prudential restraint upon themselves in approaching him for redress of their individual grievances, they will make the Agents position intolerable and even useless for the high purpose for which it is intended.
('38', 321, 1, 8, 652961) Indeed such an ambasadors usefulness lies not so much in work appertaining to his official capacity as to the indirect service he can render by his sociableness, and by his character, which leaves its impress upon anything and anybody that it comes in contact with officially or otherwise.
('38', 321, 1, 9, 653251) And if our countrymen desire to make use of the great qualities of head and heart that Sjt.
('38', 321, 1, 10, 653343) Sastri posseses, they will bear in mind the limitations I have endeavoured to set forth.
('38', 321, 1, 11, 653432) I understand that if Sjt.
('38', 321, 1, 12, 653458) Sastri goes, Mrs. Sastri too will accom pany him.
('38', 321, 1, 13, 653508) This will be a great gain to the settlers.
('38', 321, 1, 14, 653551) Let the Indian sisters in South Africa gather round Mrs. Sastri and surround her with every affection.
('38', 321, 1, 15, 653654) They will find in her an invaluable instrument of social service.
('38', 321, 1, 16, 653720) She will act as a leaven in their midst to raise the general tone among the many thousand Indian sisters who are scattered throughout South Africa.

('38', 321, 3, 18, 653891) 320. A TERRIBLE CONTRAST
('38', 321, 4, 19, 653916) A friend having for the first time seen New Delhi and the Assembly Hall in March last writes: 1
('38', 321, 5, 20, 654012) I was the other day for the first time in the Assembly Hall and it was for
('38', 321, 6, 21, 654087) the first time then that I saw New Delhi also.
('38', 321, 6, 22, 654134) I could see how millions must
('38', 321, 7, 23, 654164) have been poured into the construction of New Delhi to make it so imposing.
('38', 321, 8, 24, 654240) The Assembly Hall too presents an equally imposing appearance.
('38', 321, 8, 25, 654303) But as I
('38', 321, 9, 26, 654312) 1 Only extracts are reproduced here.
('38', 322, 0, 1, 654349) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 323
('38', 322, 1, 2, 654392) came out of the Assembly Hall, I saw dilapidated huts which turned out to be
('38', 322, 2, 3, 654469) the labour camp where I thought must be living the coolies working at the
('38', 322, 3, 4, 654543) construction of New Delhi....
('38', 322, 4, 5, 654573) The contrast between the palaces built in New Delhi for wealthy people
('38', 322, 5, 6, 654644) and the miserable huts allotted to the people whose labour was responsible for
('38', 322, 6, 7, 654723) the palaces was too terrible for contemplation....
('38', 322, 7, 8, 654774) How, I thought to myself, could the members of the Assembly day after day miss the horrible contrast which I could see even during the few moments that I was in New Delhi?
('38', 322, 8, 9, 654946) I have said nothing to any of the members.
('38', 322, 8, 10, 654989) But could you not do
('38', 322, 9, 11, 655010) anything in this matter?
('38', 322, 9, 12, 655035) I have said nothing because I could influence no one;
('38', 322, 10, 13, 655089) but you may think it worth while doing something.
('38', 322, 10, 14, 655139) You are a friend of the
('38', 322, 11, 15, 655163) poor and might be able to secure some relief.
('38', 322, 11, 16, 655209) Anyway I could not help
('38', 322, 12, 17, 655233) disburdening myself to you.
('38', 322, 12, 18, 655261) I have summarized the main contents of the letter which my fair correspondent has written in Hindi.
('38', 322, 12, 19, 655361) The criminal disparity that exists between the condition of labour and that of capital is no new thing in modern times.
('38', 322, 12, 20, 655481) The discovery made by the friend reminds one of the discovery said to have been made centuries ago by Gautama Buddha.
('38', 322, 12, 21, 655599) It was no new thing he saw.
('38', 322, 12, 22, 655627) But the shock received by the sight of old age, disease and other miseries of life transformed his life and materially affected the fortunes of the world.
('38', 322, 12, 23, 655782) It is well that this lady has received her first shock.
('38', 322, 12, 24, 655838) If she and the other cultured women of India, who have received their education at the expense of the very poor people of whom the correspondent writes so pathetically, will dive deeper and make some slight return to these poor people by making common cause with them, some alleviation in their distressful condition will not be long in coming.
('38', 322, 12, 25, 656183) Every palace that one sees in India is a demonstration not of her riches but of the insolence of power that riches give to the few, who owe them to the miserably requitted labours of the millions of the paupers of India.
('38', 322, 12, 26, 656404) We have a Government which is based upon and which only exists by the exploitation of the toiling millions.
('38', 322, 12, 27, 656512) A friend sent me the other day a cutting from an English newspaper which considered Rs. 1,500 for an Englishman to be not enough for his wants in India, and it warned Englishmen from venturing out to India if they could get not more than Rs. 1,500 per month.
('38', 322, 12, 28, 656771) There is no need to quarrel with that standard.
('38', 322, 12, 29, 656819) From the writers own standpoint, Rs. 1,500 per month is demonstrably
('38', 323, 0, 1, 656888) 324 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 323, 1, 2, 656930) inadequate because he regards club life, a motor car, migration to a hill station during the hot months, education of children in England to be the necessary minimum.
('38', 323, 1, 3, 657097) All one can say and one must say about this standard is, that if it is the indispensable minimum, it is a standard too expensive for India to afford; and however beneficial in the abstract may the services of English officials be demonstrated to be, if the toiling millions are to live, they must get along without these beneficial services for the simple reason that the benefit is beyond the reach of their pockets.
('38', 323, 1, 4, 657515) I suppose it is possible to demonstrate that if the millions of India could be translated to some bracing Himalayan plateau, they would be able to double the length of their days on earth.
('38', 323, 1, 5, 657704) But it is a proposition which they will laugh out of court as beyond their reach.
('38', 323, 1, 6, 657786) What the lady observed in New Delhi is but a tiny symptom of an ever growing and deep seated disease which is daily destroying the lives of thousands of people.
('38', 323, 1, 7, 657947) It is quite possible to imagine that if an energetic member of the Assembly moved a resolution calling upon the Government to provide better housing accommodation for the labourers, the resolution would be carried, that it would not be vetoed and that the Government would gladly give effect to it at the expense of millions poorer still than these labourers.
('38', 323, 1, 8, 658307) I am sure that this is not what the fair friend really desires.
('38', 323, 1, 9, 658371) What she desires in common with every Indian who knows anything of the country is a radical change in the system of government which is top heavy and which under its intolerable weight is crushing day after day the poor inhabitants of this country who are groaning at the bottom.
('38', 323, 1, 10, 658651) I have pointed the way out of this difficult situation times without number.
('38', 323, 1, 11, 658728) I do not know another.

('38', 323, 4, 14, 658785) KHADDAR AND PREM MAHAVIDYALAYA
('38', 323, 5, 15, 658816) Acharya Gidwani has been slowly but surely revolutionizing the mentality of the boys learning in Prem Mahavidyalaya at Brindaban.
('38', 323, 5, 16, 658946) In the course of a letter he says:
('38', 323, 6, 17, 658981) I do not boast of my khaddar work in this Mahavidyalaya; but I can safely assure you that you will not be disappointed when you see it.
('38', 323, 6, 18, 659117) Beginning with gentle pressure I have arrived at a stage when every teacher and student
('38', 324, 0, 1, 659205) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 325
('38', 324, 1, 2, 659248) wears khaddar without grudging and everyone spins on takli for 45 minutes daily.
('38', 324, 1, 3, 659329) Carding is done by turns and weaving is taught to select students.
('38', 324, 1, 4, 659396) Dyeing has been started.
('38', 324, 1, 5, 659421) About Rs. 2,000 worth of khaddar has been sold through the Prem Mahavidyalaya during the session, and everyone in Muttra and the neighbourhood looks upon the Prem Mahavidyalaya as a stronghold of shuddha khaddar.
('38', 324, 1, 6, 659634) Two tailors have been busy sewing exclusively khaddar for months in the Mahavidyalaya and will continue doing so.
('38', 324, 1, 7, 659748) I congratulate Acharya Gidwani and his staff and students.
('38', 324, 1, 8, 659807) His performance reminds me of a similar performance reported in these columns with reference to the Jamia Millia of Delhi.
('38', 324, 1, 9, 659930) These two instances and more can be quoted to show that where there are earnestness and faith there is no difficulty about response from students.
('38', 324, 1, 10, 660077) I have said repeatedly that it is the easiest thing to popularize khaddar and hand spinning in schools if the teachers have faith combined with knowledge and perseverance.
('38', 324, 1, 11, 660249) I know of no school where these three conditions being fulfilled there has been failure.

('38', 324, 2, 14, 660380) M. A. ANSARI
('38', 324, 3, 15, 660393) NANDI HILLS, April 28, 1927
('38', 324, 4, 16, 660421) DEAR DR.
('38', 324, 4, 17, 660430) ANSARI, It was a treat to receive your letter.
('38', 324, 4, 18, 660477) But you will remember that you owe me a medical visitcant call it professional because a professional visit will carry with it Rs. 1,000 per day if not more, now that you have been twice to Europe since the promise of a visit.
('38', 324, 4, 19, 660704) And, is not each European visit supposed to add to the capacity of doctors and lawyers and therefore also their daily fees?
('38', 324, 4, 20, 660828) Meanwhile, I shall bear your instructions in my mind.
('38', 324, 4, 21, 660882) My chief difficulty is how to control the mind and not to let it think, unless I develop dementia.
('38', 324, 4, 22, 660981) If you say I may not reduce my thoughts to writing or not even give utterance by speech even in the shape of conversation, I can somewhat understand; but I do not know how I can prevent the doings of Hindus and Mussalmans from making me think furiously.
('38', 324, 4, 23, 661235) Nor do I know how to prevent the growing starvation of millions acting upon my mind.
('38', 324, 4, 24, 661320) I do not need to read papers and get information to make me continuously think of these things.
('38', 324, 4, 25, 661416) The ony way to prevent me from thinking of these things is for Hindus and Mussalmans to behave like human beings rather than sub human animals and for all of us
('38', 325, 0, 1, 661577) 326 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 325, 1, 2, 661619) who get more than our share of our daily bread to think of the vast majority of the teeming millions and for their sakes to discard foreign cloth and for their encouragement to spin during every idle moment.
('38', 325, 1, 3, 661827) If it is really a fact that high blood pressure is due to an over wrought brain, I seriously contend that the only way to remove this tension would be to prescribe a starvation cure.
('38', 325, 1, 4, 662010) Deep down in me I do feel that a prolonged fast is the only radical cure because during the 21 days fast 1, I could see that after 10 days I has ceased even to think of the outside world.
('38', 325, 1, 5, 662198) The starvation had created that temporary mental adjustment.
('38', 325, 1, 6, 662259) Whilst I am eating even if it was possible the mind refuses not to think.
('38', 325, 1, 7, 662333) But under starvation the mind will co operate in ceasing to think and worry.
('38', 325, 1, 8, 662410) And, if in spite of the care that I am myself taking and in spite of the army of medical friends who see me and examine me, in spite of the quacks whose opinion I voluntarily seek and in spite of the undivided attention of devoted nurses, blood pressure refuses to yield and weakness persists, I shall certainly risk causing temporary pain to many friends and impose a fast upon myself either to end or to mend this vegetating and vexing state.
('38', 325, 1, 9, 662855) But there is no cause for any alarm.
('38', 325, 1, 10, 662892) It seems that the pressure will go down.
('38', 325, 1, 11, 662933) For the last two days I am feeling stronger than when I came to Nandi.
('38', 325, 1, 12, 663004) The highest pressure during last week was 188. On Tuesday last it was found to be 180. This was the first decline yet noticed after the collapse.
('38', 325, 1, 13, 663150) This hill is 4,850 feet, therefore, not so high as Ooty nor so cold; but it is cool enough and Doctor Mehta considers that I should not [go] to a higher altitude.
('38', 325, 1, 14, 663313) Others again say that higher the altitude the better it is for .
('38', 325, 1, 15, 663378) 2 When doctors differ what is a poor patient to do?
('38', 325, 1, 16, 663430) Some day when you are free I shall certainly expect you when we shall talk not merely of my health but about several other things of infinitely greater importance.
('38', 325, 1, 17, 663594) Please give my love to all who think of me and accept it for yourself.
('38', 325, 2, 18, 663665) Yours sincerely,

('38', 326, 2, 3, 663857) NANDI HILLS, April 28, 1927
('38', 326, 3, 4, 663885) MY DEAR SHANKARAN, Your letter is a tonic for me.
('38', 326, 3, 5, 663935) You are realizing all my expec tations.
('38', 326, 3, 6, 663975) I am delighted that the kitchen is in a perfect state now.
('38', 326, 3, 7, 664034) Who is your right hand man?
('38', 326, 3, 8, 664062) How is Giriraj doing?
('38', 326, 3, 9, 664084) Are you keeping perfect health?
('38', 326, 3, 10, 664116) Your kitchen must become a treasure store of health of mind, body and spirit.
('38', 326, 3, 11, 664194) There must be all about it and for all times a sweet ness, restfulness and peacefulness which should be capable of being detected by any passer by.
('38', 326, 3, 12, 664342) Everything in its place, everything clean, no foreign smells of a multiplicity of condiments, only the natural smell of simple edibles and workers working harmoniously, conten tedly and smilingly in their own persons showing perfect health.
('38', 326, 3, 13, 664583) Do you know that the rishis of old were poets, philosophers, cooks, sca vengers all rolled into one?
('38', 326, 3, 14, 664684) Nalaraja was a wise ruler, an ideal husband and a finished cook.
('38', 326, 3, 15, 664749) Every occupation may become disgraced by bad associations and every occupation can become a stepping stone to salvation when it is undertaken by a wise man.

('38', 326, 8, 19, 664987) MIRA, Your latest letter is still more cheerful.
('38', 326, 8, 20, 665036) I hope this mood will last.
('38', 326, 8, 21, 665064) I very nearly sent you a card in Hindi today.
('38', 326, 8, 22, 665110) But it was too late.
('38', 326, 8, 23, 665131) This [is] written after the receipt of the post, but also after its departure which precedes the receipt I have made a slight change in the food here which is approved by a distinguished doctor who is living nearby.
('38', 326, 8, 24, 665347) I am now taking raw milk and adding now and then juice of a few neem leaves and have omitted chapatis and vegetables for the time being.
('38', 326, 8, 25, 665484) I may revert to the latter two if it becomes necessary.
('38', 326, 8, 26, 665540) There is now noticed a decline in
('38', 327, 0, 1, 665574) 328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 327, 1, 2, 665616) the blood pressure for the first time since the collapse.
('38', 327, 1, 3, 665674) I am feeling altogether better.
('38', 327, 1, 4, 665706) The rest through Mahadev.
('38', 327, 1, 5, 665732) With love,
('38', 327, 3, 6, 665743) 29th Morning You should certainly translate Rollands book.
('38', 327, 3, 7, 665802) But if you are at peace with yourself now your permanent attainment of internal peace is far more important than anything else.
('38', 327, 3, 8, 665930) You like the people there.
('38', 327, 3, 9, 665957) You can therefore give them much and take also.
('38', 327, 3, 10, 666005) I would like you if you can to grow to your full height there before you leave.
('38', 327, 3, 11, 666085) My suggestion then is that you should set apart religiously an hour daily for translation and make such progress as you can.
('38', 327, 3, 12, 666210) Meanwhile, God might open the way for me to stay there for the necessary time and the facts may be revised in consultation with Mahadev.
('38', 327, 3, 13, 666347) Or when you feel that your work there is finished you can come wherever I am if I do not come there soon enough.
('38', 327, 3, 14, 666460) But you shall decide what to do.
('38', 327, 3, 15, 666493) I have told you you are free to come here whenever you like.
('38', 327, 3, 16, 666554) Only do not please regard the translation work more important than what you are doing there.
('38', 327, 3, 17, 666647) If a man is to be judged by his deeds and not by whatever the sanest man of the age may from a distant study of him say of him then the lives of co workers will be the best judgement on me.
('38', 327, 3, 18, 666837) You understand what I mean, do you not?
('38', 327, 3, 19, 666877) I fancy I have forgotten to answer a question you asked in one of your letters.
('38', 327, 3, 20, 666957) Undoubtedly the interpretation of your vow is that your last meal should be finished before 7 p.m.
('38', 327, 3, 21, 667056) or dusk whichever the vow is.
('38', 327, 3, 22, 667086) You are therefore right in your interpretation.
('38', 327, 3, 23, 667134) The rule regarding vows is when in doubt interpret against yourself, i.e., in favour of greater restriction.
('38', 327, 4, 24, 667243) BAPU [PS.] Please tell Lady Slade 1 I am thankful for her concern about me.

('38', 328, 9, 19, 668114) I am trying to bring him here.
('38', 328, 9, 20, 668145) He will get everything here.
('38', 328, 9, 21, 668174) I even feel like sending him to Mathuradas in Panchagani.
('38', 328, 9, 22, 668232) It is better not to do anything in haste.
('38', 328, 9, 23, 668274) These days, it is neither hot nor cold, so he could go for a couple of days.

('38', 329, 13, 22, 669540) I want you and Ramdas to get ready and prepare yourselves for it.
('38', 329, 13, 23, 669606) I write this to you after I have written to Ramdas.
('38', 329, 13, 24, 669658) I have long since been corresponding with Ramdas.
('38', 329, 13, 25, 669708) Go through the enclosed extract from Ramdass letter.
('38', 329, 13, 26, 669761) I wish both of you would devote your lives to service; Ramdas does wish to.
('38', 329, 13, 27, 669837) You should earn your livelihood too from it, as Maganlal does and many others too.
('38', 329, 13, 28, 669920) I wish you two could become an ideal couple, for which you should begin your efforts from now on.

('38', 330, 1, 3, 670179) I have been doing it in two cases; one of Chi.
('38', 330, 1, 4, 670226) [Kishorelal] and Gomatibehn and the other of Thakkar and his wife.
('38', 330, 1, 5, 670293) But you can surpass them both.
('38', 330, 1, 6, 670324) The job that you are required to do will be easy but you will get the satisfaction that you can earn on your own, and one should always try to prove that one can.
('38', 330, 1, 7, 670487) You can run your home along with this occupation, and, I think, you can also look after your children when you have them.
('38', 330, 1, 8, 670609) Thousands of husbands and wives from poor families earn their living in this way.
('38', 330, 1, 9, 670691) You know yourself the cases of Dudabhai and Danibehn, of Ramjibhai and Gangabehn.
('38', 330, 1, 10, 670773) We shall also remain poor alongside of them.
('38', 330, 1, 11, 670818) Only then shall we be fit to realize God.
('38', 330, 1, 12, 670860) For accomplishing this you ought to improve your ginning, carding and spinning.
('38', 330, 1, 13, 670940) Side by side, you must improve your know ledge of Gujarati and pick up some book keeping.
('38', 330, 1, 14, 671030) You can find time for all this.
('38', 330, 1, 15, 671062) You must improve your health too.

('38', 330, 7, 27, 671705) April 30, 1927 In my article 3 about buffaloes I have said nothing about destroying them; on the contrary an attempt should be made to raise their breed.

('38', 331, 1, 2, 672028) protected.
('38', 331, 1, 3, 672039) What I mean is that cow protection alone can be part of dharma.
('38', 331, 1, 4, 672103) It includes compassion for other animals.
('38', 331, 1, 5, 672145) But these are not being destroyed.
('38', 331, 1, 6, 672180) There is no need to take up the stupendous task of stopping their destruction.
('38', 331, 1, 7, 672259) And if we are able to protect the cow, all else that needs to be done will be accomplished automatically.
('38', 331, 1, 8, 672365) It is not the purport of my writing to ignore the buffalo.
('38', 331, 1, 9, 672424) I only indicate the limit of our ability.
('38', 331, 1, 10, 672466) Even the villages ought to have something in the nature of a tannery, a dairy.
('38', 331, 1, 11, 672545) In other words, the tanning process in the villages needs to be improved.
('38', 331, 1, 12, 672619) There is need for some sophistication in the manner of skinning.
('38', 331, 1, 13, 672684) There should be some expert experi menting with regard to the cow; there has to be knowledge of the methods of increasing their yield.
('38', 331, 1, 14, 672819) It is our misfortune that today we can only carry this knowledge from the town to the country.
('38', 331, 1, 15, 672914) At the moment we are not even aware of this science.
('38', 331, 1, 16, 672967) I mean, we shall be able to do nothing before those who have learnt it in the West evolve it anew with an appreciation of the local environment and in an assimilable form.
('38', 331, 1, 17, 673139) So, for the time being, we shall only be experi menting, the point being that an industry which is today handled mainly by ignorant men for earning a livelihood should be taken up by the educated class, keeping in view our countrys welfare, as is being done in the case of spinning and weaving.
('38', 331, 1, 18, 673434) Efforts in the direc tion have now been initiated in the Ashram.

('38', 331, 6, 27, 673787) Service does include ones interest.
('38', 331, 6, 28, 673823) One who serves with a pure heart is always provided for by God.

('38', 332, 1, 4, 674238) If you feel that you lack aptitude for doing a thing, this shortcoming can certainly be removed by trying hard.

('38', 332, 5, 10, 674631) CHHAGANLAL, We all deliberated a lot this morning about Prabhudas.
('38', 332, 5, 11, 674698) Along with other places you are thinking of, keep in mind Nandi too.
('38', 332, 5, 12, 674767) However, Rajaji and others are of the opinion that it would be better if no sick person is sent there.
('38', 332, 5, 13, 674870) I do not put Prabhudas in the category of such persons.
('38', 332, 5, 14, 674926) For him, it is better if we take a decision soon.
('38', 332, 5, 15, 674976) Why cannot he go to Doctor in Dholwad?
('38', 332, 5, 16, 675015) Gangabehn will look after him also.
('38', 332, 5, 17, 675051) And at Panchgani, there is the facility of Mathuradass room and he could stay with him.
('38', 332, 5, 18, 675139) Instead of my asking Mathuradas, it is better if you ask him.
('38', 332, 5, 19, 675201) He will be a little confused if I ask him.
('38', 332, 5, 20, 675244) Or, instead of going there, he should come here.
('38', 332, 5, 21, 675293) Gangadharrao says that he can go to Hubli.
('38', 332, 5, 22, 675336) It is at a height of 3000 ft.
('38', 332, 5, 23, 675366) Prabhudas has seen the place.
('38', 332, 5, 24, 675396) Pundalik is there.
('38', 332, 5, 25, 675415) So he would not need any other companion.
('38', 332, 5, 26, 675457) Out of all these places, choose one.
('38', 332, 5, 27, 675494) I find it somewhat difficult to accept Almora.
('38', 332, 5, 28, 675541) Jamnadas himself needs looking after.
('38', 332, 5, 29, 675579) What is the good of putting two sick persons together.
('38', 332, 5, 30, 675634) An added reason for my preference for Panchgani is the possibility of Pyarelal being there.
('38', 332, 5, 31, 675726) Write to me whatever decision you take or send me a telegram.

('38', 335, 9, 23, 679533) DEAR LALAJI, The afore mentioned letter 3 was written last night.
('38', 335, 9, 24, 679599) I did not fully reveal my feelings.
('38', 335, 9, 25, 679635) My congratulations were not without a tinge of criticism.
('38', 335, 9, 26, 679693) Let me now say it out.
('38', 335, 9, 27, 679716) The idea is laudable but your method of implementing it has its own flaws.
('38', 335, 9, 28, 679791) Your wife and children should not become the trustees.
('38', 335, 10, 29, 679846) 1 From the reference to thefts in the Ashram; vide 1st footnote to the preceding item.

('38', 336, 1, 2, 680057) Your trustees should be those who entirely agree with your thoughts and are prepared to suffer the severest hardships to see them materialize.
('38', 336, 1, 3, 680200) If your wife, daughter and son have these qualities they can be the trustees, though they are related to you.
('38', 336, 1, 4, 680310) Now I have told you the whole truth and thank God He gave me the strength to do so.
('38', 336, 1, 5, 680394) Without it I would not have been able to do my duty which, as a friend, I ought to do.

('38', 336, 11, 17, 680842) MIRA, I wrote to you a postcard 1 in Hindi just to tell you that I was thinking constantly of you and to see whether you could read and understand my Hindi.
('38', 336, 11, 18, 680999) Do not be alarmed.
('38', 336, 11, 19, 681018) I do not propose to write to you always in Hindi.
('38', 336, 11, 20, 681068) But if you can follow my Hindi, I do want now and then to write my extra letters in Hindi, i.e., if you like the idea, not otherwise.
('38', 336, 11, 21, 681202) Now for your disturbing wire.
('38', 336, 11, 22, 681232) I wonder what in my letters has prompted it.
('38', 336, 11, 23, 681277) You can have no notion of the energy I have already regained.
('38', 336, 11, 24, 681339) I have written for Navajivan four articles this week.
('38', 336, 11, 25, 681393) For Young India I wrote three last week.
('38', 336, 11, 26, 681434) I am really doing almost the

('38', 337, 0, 1, 681501) 338 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 337, 1, 2, 681543) normal work for the papers now.
('38', 337, 1, 3, 681575) And I do a fair amount of love letters.
('38', 337, 1, 4, 681615) But all this is nothing compared to the result of medical examination yesterday.
('38', 337, 1, 5, 681696) The pressure dropped from 188 to 155, and 155 to 160 is the normal for my age.
('38', 337, 1, 6, 681775) I have been walking for the last three days over one mile per day in two periods each extending to 30 minutes.
('38', 337, 1, 7, 681886) This is more than Amboli.
('38', 337, 1, 8, 681912) So there is now no anxiety about my health.
('38', 337, 1, 9, 681956) There can be no question now of leaving Nandi.
('38', 337, 1, 10, 682003) It would be foolish to think of leaving it till my previous strength is attained, if it can be at all or till the season for Nandi ends which it does about July.
('38', 337, 1, 11, 682165) I observe from your wire that in spite of your previous letter of attainment of peace, the pendulum has swung back and that you are again perturbed.
('38', 337, 1, 12, 682314) This does not surprise me.
('38', 337, 1, 13, 682341) If our lucid moments were lasting, nothing further will remain to be done.
('38', 337, 1, 14, 682416) Unfortunately or fortunately, we have to pass through many an ebb and flow before we settle down to real peace.
('38', 337, 1, 15, 682528) I have therefore left you free to do as you please.
('38', 337, 1, 16, 682580) Better certainly if you can keep your peace and stay.
('38', 337, 1, 17, 682634) Equally certainly come away if you cannot keep your peace.
('38', 337, 1, 18, 682693) Only, in any decision you come to, please eliminate the question of my health.
('38', 337, 1, 19, 682772) For if you come, you would find little difference between me as you saw me in Kangri and me as I am now.
('38', 337, 1, 20, 682877) Dive deep into yourself then and find out if you can where you are and act accordingly irrespective of what I would like you to do.
('38', 337, 1, 21, 683009) Or put it another way.
('38', 337, 1, 22, 683032) I would like you to do what your inner spirit tells you to do.

('38', 338, 3, 6, 683330) Our body must be strong and radiant.
('38', 338, 3, 7, 683367) An ideal virgin is expected to be at the top in every respect.
('38', 338, 3, 8, 683430) If you have not to go to Karachi, I would like to send you instead of Champavati to Delhi.
('38', 338, 3, 9, 683521) There are many girls there and lots of work.
('38', 338, 3, 10, 683566) And the climate of Delhi is excellent.
('38', 338, 3, 11, 683605) I expect a wire from Karachi soon.
('38', 338, 3, 12, 683640) Let me know if any of the women in the Ashram are afraid of thieves.
('38', 338, 3, 13, 683709) Was Radha badly hurt?
('38', 338, 3, 14, 683731) Did she have a fright?
('38', 338, 3, 15, 683754) 1 I dont have the time now to write to her separately.

('38', 338, 8, 20, 683908) Silence Day, Vaishakha Sud 2 [May 3, 1927] 2
('38', 338, 9, 21, 683953) SISTERS, I have now received plenty of hand made paper.
('38', 338, 9, 22, 684009) Even though the size of the paper is a little smaller than what you ask for, I believe you will prefer hand made paper.
('38', 338, 9, 23, 684129) Our chief duty today, of course, lies in regard to cloth; because from it our starving masses obtain their bread.
('38', 338, 9, 24, 684243) There are not many who make this paper.
('38', 338, 9, 25, 684283) Yet as long as we find something that is made in our country, and it is good, we must procure and use it.
('38', 338, 9, 26, 684389) It is very good that you have set apart some money for postage.
('38', 338, 9, 27, 684453) It does not matter if the amount is small; but keep regular accounts so

('38', 339, 0, 1, 684642) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 339, 1, 2, 684684) that those of you who can, may learn thereby how to keep accounts.
('38', 339, 1, 3, 684751) I find your progress in another direction also praiseworthy.
('38', 339, 1, 4, 684812) Last week I raised the problem of protecting yourselves against thieves.
('38', 339, 2, 5, 684885) Do not lightly brush it aside.
('38', 339, 2, 6, 684916) I wish you to falsify the epithets weak, timid and so on that are specially used about women.
('38', 339, 2, 7, 685010) They do not apply to all women of course.
('38', 339, 2, 8, 685052) Who would say the women of Raniparaj are timid?
('38', 339, 2, 9, 685100) How can you call them weak?
('38', 339, 2, 10, 685128) The women of the West, of course, take part these days in everything.
('38', 339, 2, 11, 685198) I do not mean to say that they should be imitated; but at least they have been falsifying many of the assumptions of men.
('38', 339, 2, 12, 685320) The Negro women of Africa are not at all timid.
('38', 339, 2, 13, 685368) Perhaps there is no such epithet in their language to be applied to them.
('38', 339, 2, 14, 685442) In Burma, it is the men who appear timid and as it were the weaker sex.
('38', 339, 2, 15, 685514) Women themselves carry on business of all kinds.
('38', 339, 2, 16, 685563) I raised the problem of thieves, not to frighten you, but to make you think calmly about it.
('38', 339, 2, 17, 685656) In the Ashram we all wish to realize that we have a soul.
('38', 339, 2, 18, 685714) Now the soul is neither male nor female; neither young nor old.
('38', 339, 2, 19, 685778) The scriptures as well as our own experience tell us that these are the attributes only of the body.
('38', 339, 2, 20, 685879) The same soul pervades you and me.
('38', 339, 2, 21, 685914) How then can I protect you ?
('38', 339, 2, 22, 685943) Is it not by learning the art of how to protect oneself?
('38', 339, 2, 23, 686000) Only then can I teach you.
('38', 339, 2, 24, 686027) There is enough for you to think over here.
('38', 339, 2, 25, 686071) If I feel inclined, I will take up the subject once again.
('38', 339, 2, 26, 686130) If any of you wish to write to me, do so without hesitation.
('38', 339, 2, 27, 686191) I learn that Valjibhai has frightened all of you.
('38', 339, 2, 28, 686241) Do not get frightened.

('38', 340, 10, 18, 687001) MATHURADAS, I have been wanting to write to you for a good many days, but can do so only now.
('38', 340, 10, 19, 687095) Hardly a day passes when I do not talk about you or think of you.
('38', 340, 10, 20, 687161) You had asked Pyarelal to find out about Nandi.
('38', 340, 10, 21, 687209) In my opinion Nandi will not suit you.
('38', 340, 10, 22, 687248) It is not a place where you can stay through out the year.
('38', 340, 10, 23, 687307) The weather changes greatly within 24 hours.
('38', 340, 10, 24, 687352) And the variations are too great in winter and summer.
('38', 340, 10, 25, 687407) All provisions have to be secured from the plains.
('38', 340, 10, 26, 687458) The season is over by June.
('38', 340, 10, 27, 687486) So I think only Panchgani would suit you.
('38', 340, 10, 28, 687528) It is another question how long we should occupy the bungalow at Panchgani.
('38', 340, 10, 29, 687604) This season is already past.
('38', 340, 10, 30, 687633) So it is all right to spend the monsoon there.
('38', 340, 10, 31, 687680) Then perhaps it will be better for you to go to Mahabaleshwar.

('38', 341, 1, 2, 687860) very good.
('38', 341, 1, 3, 687871) If we have to undergo the same sort of thing next year also we have time enough to decide what to do.
('38', 341, 1, 4, 687973) Revashankarbhai lives in Solan.
('38', 341, 1, 5, 688005) I have asked him to let me know how things are there.
('38', 341, 1, 6, 688059) My health is gradually improving.
('38', 341, 1, 7, 688093) Hence there is nothing to write on that score.
('38', 341, 1, 8, 688140) I can see that Taramati will not write unless she is provoked.
('38', 341, 1, 9, 688203) Tell her in my opinion she is lazy.
('38', 341, 1, 10, 688239) I want her fully to benefit physically, mentally and spiritually by her stay at Panchgani.
('38', 341, 1, 11, 688330) Dilip appears to be deriving the fullest benefit from staying there.
('38', 341, 1, 12, 688399) This morning Pyarelal started out on his way to join you.
('38', 341, 1, 13, 688457) I now have your wire, and so I have sent a telegram to Pyarelal at Bangalore to stop him.
('38', 341, 1, 14, 688547) From your letter it appears that I alone was responsible for detaining Pyarelal.
('38', 341, 1, 15, 688628) I wanted to keep him with me for a few days.
('38', 341, 1, 16, 688673) After your telegram yesterday he asked my permission to leave and I gave the permission.
('38', 341, 1, 17, 688762) Now I will wait for your letter.
('38', 341, 1, 18, 688795) And I will do whatever is proper.
('38', 341, 1, 19, 688829) You had wished that I should stay at Panchgani.
('38', 341, 1, 20, 688877) But that was not possible.
('38', 341, 1, 21, 688904) Work demanded that 1 should be in this province.
('38', 341, 1, 22, 688953) Once my health is normal I shall certainly finish the work.
('38', 341, 1, 23, 689013) True, it will be done in a somewhat novel manner.

('38', 341, 6, 30, 689261) In another column will be seen an extract from Navajivan of a most disgraceful case of calculated inhumanity of a medical man towards the dying wife of a member of the suppressed class in Kathiawar village.
('38', 341, 6, 31, 689468) Amritlal Thakkar who is responsible for giving the details of the case has withheld the names of the place and parties for fear of the poor suppressed class schoolmaster being further molested by the medical man.
('38', 341, 6, 32, 689681) I wish, however, that the names will be disclosed.
('38', 341, 6, 33, 689732) Time must come when the suppressed class people will have

('38', 342, 1, 2, 689833) to be encouraged by us to dare to suffer further hardships and tyranny.
('38', 342, 1, 3, 689905) Their sufferings are already too great for any further sufferings to be really felt.
('38', 342, 1, 4, 689990) Public opinion cannot be roused over grievances that cannot be verified and traced to their sources.
('38', 342, 1, 5, 690091) I do not know the rules of the Medical Council in Bombay.
('38', 342, 1, 6, 690149) I know that in other places a medical practitioner, who refused to attend before his fees were paid, would be answerable to the Council and would be liable to have his name removed from the Councils list and be otherwise subject to disciplinary action.
('38', 342, 1, 7, 690402) Fees are no doubt exactable; but proper attendance upon patients is the first duty of a medical practitioner.
('38', 342, 1, 8, 690512) The real inhumanity, however, if the facts stated are true, consists in the practitioner refusing to enter the untouchables quarters, refusing himself to see the patient, and refusing himself to apply the thermometer.
('38', 342, 1, 9, 690730) And if the doctrine of untouchability can ever be applied in any circumstances, it is certainly applicable to this member of the profession which he has disgraced.
('38', 342, 1, 10, 690894) But I am hoping that there is some exaggeration in the statement made by Sjt.
('38', 342, 1, 11, 690972) Thakkars correspondent and, if there is none, that the medical practitioner will himself come forth and make ample amends to the society which he has so outraged by his inhuman conduct.

('38', 345, 13, 16, 694526) DEAR FRIEND, Owing to my sudden illness, I have not been able to reply earlier to your letter of the 17th ultimo.
('38', 345, 13, 17, 694640) The remarks quoted by you and ascribed to me in the Minority Report 2, which of course I have not seen, are substantially correct but they have been torn from their context.
('38', 345, 13, 18, 694814) In the speech, the report of which I have not read, from which I suppose the remarks quoted by you have been taken, I was drawing a distinction between Ayurveda and Ayurvedic physicians of today and I do hold the opinion that they do not do justice to the profession they seek to represent.
('38', 345, 13, 19, 695105) But these remarks should not be used in support of any proposition designed to prevent Governments assistance being given for Ayurveda research.
('38', 345, 13, 20, 695250) I believe that Ayurveda is a field for much research work.
('38', 345, 13, 21, 695309) For want of research scholars, unlike Western medicine, it has practically come to a standstill.

('38', 346, 1, 2, 695503) Therefore, I should not discountenance aid being given to Ayurveda research under given circumstances and to honest and industrious men who love research work and who have the necessary qualifi cations.
('38', 346, 1, 3, 695706) I should add that the remarks attributed to me were made at the ceremony of laying the foundation of an Ayurvedic College.
('38', 346, 1, 4, 695829) Had I been averse to any aid being given to Ayurvedic work, I should certainly have declined to lay the foundation of an Ayurvedic College at Calcutta, to open the Tibbia College in Delhi and very recently, to open an Ayurvedic Hospital at Ahmednagar.

('38', 347, 9, 23, 697681) DEAR SISTER, I have both your letters.
('38', 347, 9, 24, 697720) I can understand your grief at the death of Anil.
('38', 347, 9, 25, 697770) But you should add to your spiritual strength as a result of this.
('38', 347, 9, 26, 697837) Continuous grief wears out ones strength.
('38', 347, 9, 27, 697879) One can add to ones strength by putting ones sorrows to good use, and it is best utilized by intensifying our desire to serve.
('38', 347, 9, 28, 698006) It is therefore my constant prayer that one should devote every moment of ones life to service.
('38', 347, 9, 29, 698102) One can practise it in two ways: first, by reading good books and meditating on them; secondly, by constantly engaging oneself in altruistic activities.

('38', 348, 1, 2, 698475) As for asceticism, it is this that weakens our attachment to worldly objects and strengthens our love of things spiritual.
('38', 348, 1, 3, 698598) One attains asceticism by reasoning, while one succeeds in practising it by persis tent effort.
('38', 348, 1, 4, 698694) For this very reason one may describe practice as sustained effort.
('38', 348, 1, 5, 698762) Nikhil still seems to have a weak heart; what, in the opinion of the doctors, is the reason for this?

('38', 348, 5, 8, 698920) 356. COW v.
('38', 348, 5, 9, 698932) BUFFALO OR COW CUM BUFFALO?
('38', 348, 6, 10, 698960) A worker in the cause of cow protection writes from Konkan:
('38', 348, 7, 11, 699020) In your recent article 2 giving the conditions of cow protection you said that the question of the protection of the cow should not be mixed up with that of the protection of the buffalo.
('38', 348, 7, 12, 699208) At the back of this suggestion seems to be the fact that the buffalo bull is not useful for agricultural purposes.
('38', 348, 7, 13, 699323) But in Konkan he is fairly useful.
('38', 348, 7, 14, 699358) It is the buffalo bull which draws the municipal refuse carts, which works water pumps and even draws the plough, especially when there is a heavy downpour disabling the bullock and most of the agriculture in Konkan is being done under monsoon conditions.
('38', 348, 7, 15, 699614) The buffalo bull has therefore his place in Konkan.
('38', 348, 8, 16, 699666) The Konkan cow does not yield more than one pound of milk, whereas the buffalo yields 5 to 10 lb.
('38', 348, 8, 17, 699764) It may be possible, after systematic breeding, to make the cow yield more and richer milk, but the buffalo needs no special culture at all.
('38', 348, 8, 18, 699904) Does not therefore the buffalo in Konkan at any rate need as much protection as the cow?
('38', 348, 8, 19, 699993) Please correct me if I am wrong.
('38', 348, 9, 20, 700026) The buffalo, I admit, has no place on the ghats where the temperature is higher, fields are bigger and water scarce.
('38', 348, 9, 21, 700143) He needs much water both to drink and bathe in.
('38', 348, 9, 22, 700191) Konkan is the place for him.
('38', 348, 10, 23, 700220) Your tannery and dairy are for cities.
('38', 348, 10, 24, 700259) For the villages you must suggest some more practical ways and means.
('38', 348, 10, 25, 700329) Let every village possess a studbull, maintain him partly from the common fund and partly from contributions from those who make use of him.
('38', 348, 10, 26, 700470) This can be done everywhere and it will improve the stock.
('38', 348, 10, 27, 700529) Could you not suggest similar other remedies?

('38', 349, 0, 1, 700718) 350 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 349, 1, 2, 700760) These are appropriate questions.
('38', 349, 1, 3, 700793) My article was not intended to throw the buffalo by the board, it suggested the stopping of buffalo breeding in her own interest.
('38', 349, 1, 4, 700923) In other words it meant freedom of the buffalo from its bondage.
('38', 349, 1, 5, 700988) We have domesticated the cow for our own uses and therefore it has become part of our religion to protect her.
('38', 349, 1, 6, 701099) It was my object to show that in trying to breed the buffalo, as we do the cow, we might lose both.
('38', 349, 1, 7, 701199) The Konkan example does not affect my proposition.
('38', 349, 1, 8, 701250) We must, of course, make use of the existing stock of buffaloes, and let it be done in parts like Konkan.
('38', 349, 1, 9, 701356) But our duty is clear.
('38', 349, 1, 10, 701379) We must not increase our responsibility by breeding the buffalo where we can do with the cow alone.
('38', 349, 1, 11, 701479) We must therefore content ourselves with the use of cows milk only.
('38', 349, 1, 12, 701547) It should not be necessary in a city like Bombay to use buffalos milk in preference to cows milk.
('38', 349, 1, 13, 701645) An endeavour should be organized on a large scale to cheapen the supply of pure cows milk, and to improve the milk yield of the cow.
('38', 349, 1, 14, 701778) It is possible too to make cows milk richer.
('38', 349, 1, 15, 701823) All these things have been developed into a science in Europe, especially in Denmark.
('38', 349, 1, 16, 701909) Cows in those countries yield richer and more milk than our buffaloes.
('38', 349, 1, 17, 701980) I have heard from vaidyas that buffalos milk lacks and can never be made to have the hygenic and health giving properties that cows milk possesses.
('38', 349, 1, 18, 702128) Pious people have told me that cows milk is sattvic (possessing finer qualities) whereas buffalos milk is tamasic (gross).
('38', 349, 1, 19, 702251) I do not know how far this is true.
('38', 349, 1, 20, 702287) I am trying to ascertain the truth through the proper channel.
('38', 349, 1, 21, 702350) But it does seem to me, that all that the buffalo can give and even more, the cow also can or can be made to give.
('38', 349, 1, 22, 702465) If this is true, why should man, having regard to his own needs, make himself responsible for breeding the buffalo ?
('38', 349, 1, 23, 702582) And having regard to the need of the buffalo, why should we needlessly keep her in bondage ?
('38', 349, 1, 24, 702675) Or to put it more simply, why should we press her into our service?
('38', 349, 1, 25, 702743) The fact that some people make a pecuniary gain out of buffalo breeding can have no place in this religious discussion in which we have in view the good of all.
('38', 349, 1, 26, 702904) In thinking solely of the narrow interest of the self or of the moment, we have ruined ourselves, i.e., our country and our religion.
('38', 349, 1, 27, 703038) We can be a nation, only when we try to think in terms of the wider interests of the country.
('38', 349, 1, 28, 703132) If we cannot even think in those terms, it is no use talking of religion.
('38', 349, 1, 29, 703206) From the national point of view, the good of the country is the supreme consideration.
('38', 349, 1, 30, 703293) From the religious point of view the good of all living

('38', 350, 1, 2, 703392) beings from the cow down to the ant is the supreme consideration.
('38', 350, 2, 3, 703458) Let the reader now turn to the table given elsewhere in this issue.
('38', 350, 2, 4, 703526) The table relates to the income from and expenditure on the cattle maintained at the Satyagraha Ashram.
('38', 350, 2, 5, 703630) The names are those of different cows.
('38', 350, 2, 6, 703669) The manager in his covering letter says:
('38', 350, 3, 7, 703710) It is by no means the rule that the buffalo yields more than the cow.
('38', 350, 3, 8, 703780) Some of the cows in the table yield a net profit, some just pay their way and some are boarders.
('38', 350, 3, 9, 703877) These last we shall prevent from breeding and propose to take light work from them.
('38', 350, 3, 10, 703961) A sterile cow has already been trained to do some work.
('38', 350, 3, 11, 704017) The buffalo calves sell cheap, whereas some calves of the cow are worth Rs. 100 each.
('38', 350, 3, 12, 704103) Two or three have taken the place of the horse with the result that we have dispensed with our horse carriage.
('38', 350, 3, 13, 704214) The Ashram has decided to have no more buffaloes.
('38', 350, 3, 14, 704264) We may not draw large deductions from the table, but it is certainly obvious that if the cow is fed properly she compares favourably with the buffalo in her yield, she does not cost more, and her calves are much more useful.
('38', 350, 3, 15, 704489) I propose to publish in Navajivan the results of the further experiments that are being conducted in the Ashram.
('38', 350, 3, 16, 704602) The Konkan friend is not right when he says that the dairy and the tannery are useful only in and for the city, and have no place in the villages.
('38', 350, 3, 17, 704749) The cow has become a costly proposition even in the villages.
('38', 350, 3, 18, 704811) It is as essential to keep proper accounts of her yield and to improve her stock and her milk in villages as in cities.
('38', 350, 3, 19, 704931) And the skinning of dead cattle and the prompt and skilled treatment of the hides is more essential in villages than in cities, and that is the work to be done in tanneries.
('38', 350, 3, 20, 705105) It is a painful fact that in our present condition we have to cultivate the science of tanning in the cities and then take it to the villages.
('38', 350, 3, 21, 705248) For one thing it is impossible to conduct big experiments in the villages, and cattle that are slaughtered in the cities come from the villages.
('38', 350, 3, 22, 705393) If we can therefore conduct experiments in dairying and tanning from the religious and national point of view in the cities, we can easily give the benefit of them to the villages, and the cattle wealth of India which is at the present day being destroyed because of our ignorance will be saved, and man and animal will both be less unhappy than now.

('38', 351, 1, 2, 705874) 357. WHAT CAN PERSEVERANCE NOT ACHIEVE?
('38', 351, 2, 3, 705914) In the West we sometimes see a man performing club swinging continuously for twenty four hours.
('38', 351, 2, 4, 706010) These shows are held to demons trate how far a mans endurance can go.
('38', 351, 2, 5, 706080) Thousands of spectators give money and fill the theatres to see that.
('38', 351, 2, 6, 706150) I have my own doubts whether these kinds of shows are of any use.
('38', 351, 2, 7, 706216) But readers will recall that something like this, though with a different, i.
('38', 351, 2, 8, 706294) e., religious motive was organized in the Ashram during the National Week.
('38', 351, 2, 9, 706369) Some youths insisted on plying the charkha continuously for twenty four hours, forgoing their usual sleep.
('38', 351, 2, 10, 706476) The letter written by the one who spun the largest quantity of yarn is interesting and, therefore, I give it below: 1
('38', 351, 3, 11, 706594) Those who welcome any manifestation of enthusiasm by the young or have faith in the charkha yajna will feel happy to read this letter.
('38', 351, 3, 12, 706729) Those students who happen to read this letter should learn a lesson from it.
('38', 351, 3, 13, 706806) It is good to have interest in games, but it is better still to have the same interest in philanthropic work.
('38', 351, 3, 14, 706916) They should also observe that such uninterrupted work is quite within the capacity of those who safeguard their health and observe brahmacharya.
('38', 351, 3, 15, 707061) It is an abuse of ones education to use it for earning money.
('38', 351, 3, 16, 707123) Education proves its worth when used for the service of others.
('38', 351, 3, 17, 707187) Moreover, a student needs to have faith also.
('38', 351, 3, 18, 707233) Reason will certainly help a little to understand that Indias poverty can be banished through a simple thing like the charkha.
('38', 351, 3, 19, 707360) But, in the end, it is only faith which will sustain the students love of it.
('38', 351, 3, 20, 707438) I realize every moment, from what I see of students, that without faith education is of little use.

('38', 352, 3, 4, 707696) MIRA, I hope you are getting all the letters I have been writing to you of late.
('38', 352, 3, 5, 707777) Probably one letter every other day on an average.
('38', 352, 3, 6, 707828) I have your further letter.
('38', 352, 3, 7, 707856) But I see it 2 will be some time before you regain your balance.
('38', 352, 3, 8, 707921) I do not mind the ups and downs so long as you retain the elasticity.
('38', 352, 3, 9, 707991) My own opinion is this: it will be perfectly natural for you to come to me wherever I am after finishing your allotted task, whenever that happens.
('38', 352, 3, 10, 708139) An ordinary person may not give up a self imposed programme.
('38', 352, 3, 11, 708200) But if you become highly emotional and your nerves remain under tension, you should come even though your course may not be finished.
('38', 352, 3, 12, 708334) Naturally I am anxious for you to finish your course.
('38', 352, 3, 13, 708388) I should not like to have to think that it was beyond you.
('38', 352, 3, 14, 708447) But your health is more precious to me than your studies or any other preparation .
('38', 352, 3, 15, 708531) You must not think of coming to me for my health.
('38', 352, 3, 16, 708581) For it is good and I cannot be looked after better even if you came.
('38', 352, 3, 17, 708650) If I needed your nursing, I should wire for you.
('38', 352, 3, 18, 708699) But such an event will not happen, if only because I have got into the habit of taking nursing from anybody and I train new nurses to my requirements.
('38', 352, 3, 19, 708850) There are more nurses than I need here.
('38', 352, 3, 20, 708890) So if you come in the hope of doing some personal service, you would feel idle and yawning.
('38', 352, 3, 21, 708982) Now for the necessity of personal touch.
('38', 352, 3, 22, 709023) My own opinion is that it is necessary in the preliminary stages.
('38', 352, 3, 23, 709089) And then the touch comes through joint work.
('38', 352, 3, 24, 709134) You come in daily touch with me by doing my work as if it was your own.
('38', 352, 3, 25, 709206) And this can, must and will outlast the existence of this physical body of mine.
('38', 352, 3, 26, 709287) You are and will be in touch whether I am alive or dead.
('38', 352, 3, 27, 709344) And that is what I want you to be.
('38', 352, 3, 28, 709379) You have come to me not for me but for my ideals in so far as I live them.
('38', 352, 3, 29, 709454) You now know how far I live the ideals I set forth.
('38', 352, 3, 30, 709506) It is now for you to work out those ideals and practise them to greater perfection than has been given to me to do.

('38', 353, 6, 13, 710436) DEAR FRIEND, I got your letter too late to enable me to write to you so as to reach you.
('38', 353, 6, 14, 710525) It was impossible for me to travel to Bombay because medical orders are peremptoryas peremptory as your own and seeing that the medical orders were prior in point of time, they had to be obeyed.
('38', 353, 6, 15, 710720) I have really begun now to despair of your ever teaching me.
('38', 353, 6, 16, 710781) You promised to turn my Ashram ground into a paradise if I sent you a map and all the details of past successes and failures.
('38', 353, 6, 17, 710907) Well, I have given you all the information, I sent you my best man and the Ashram ground still awaits the magic touch.
('38', 353, 6, 18, 711026) All the information about the poverty of the masses that you can give me can never be first hand because all you can tell me is stories of witnesses.
('38', 353, 6, 19, 711176) You have not tasted the sweets of poverty.
('38', 353, 6, 20, 711219) And, what is a millionaire, a successful engineer and a business man to teach one who knows the sweet, as well as the bitter, of poverty and who has come in direct touch with the masses about the latters poverty?
('38', 353, 6, 21, 711432) Thirdlybut I must not say anything about the third thing at the present moment.

('38', 354, 1, 3, 711741) I am not aware of having made you any promise that I shall never take part in politics and what is more, I have not taken part in politics as yet.
('38', 354, 1, 4, 711888) But I do promise that if favourable opportunity occurs, I should not hesitate to plunge into them.
('38', 354, 1, 5, 711987) For the present I am content to sit at the wheel and sing the praises of God in that He gives me strength enough to perform that little bit of service to the masses of India in whose exploitation you are taking such a prominent part be it ever so unconsciously.
('38', 354, 1, 6, 712249) I do not expect any reply to this letter whilst you are in the West.
('38', 354, 1, 7, 712318) When you do come to India I shall be glad to receive a further instalment of your promises with the certain knowledge that you will continue to break them as heretofore and like the wolf that swore at the lamb turn against me and accuse me of breaking promises never made by me.
('38', 354, 1, 8, 712597) I shall take all such rebuke in good grace as in spite of your arrogation of universal knowledge, I have great regard for the qualities of your heart.

('38', 354, 7, 18, 713114) I am unable to tell you when the autobiography will be finished.
('38', 354, 7, 19, 713179) I have to write from day to day.

('38', 355, 6, 9, 714183) MATHURADAS, Pyarelal is on his way to join you.
('38', 355, 6, 10, 714231) You will receive this letter the day offer his arrival.
('38', 355, 6, 11, 714287) I could not send the letter with him.
('38', 355, 6, 12, 714325) I have sent Pyarelal because he felt that he had got to go back there for accounts, etc.
('38', 355, 6, 13, 714414) Your decision to carry on without him is fine if it does not mean any harm to your health.
('38', 355, 6, 14, 714505) We must be grateful that your health has improved to that extent.
('38', 355, 6, 15, 714571) But do not hesitate to write to me any time you feel the need for help.
('38', 355, 6, 16, 714643) I think it would be good to spend the present monsoon there.
('38', 355, 6, 17, 714704) Panchgani is definitely better than Deolali.
('38', 355, 6, 18, 714749) It is said to be particularly good in the rainy season.

('38', 355, 6, 20, 714891) But the doctors would know better.

('38', 356, 4, 4, 715225) I had two letters again.
('38', 356, 4, 5, 715250) How is it that letters bearing different dates are received the same day in different packets ?
('38', 356, 4, 6, 715346) I have nothing more to say today.
('38', 356, 4, 7, 715380) I am glad you have completely regained your balance.
('38', 356, 4, 8, 715433) My idea about the translation is that you should make it at first without reference to any other translation and then for your difficul ties turn to the English version.
('38', 356, 4, 9, 715603) It is right for you to be diffident but I have no misgivings and I do not want you to lose your originality by concurrent reference to any aid save that of a dictionary.
('38', 356, 4, 10, 715773) Mark the passages you may not understand and refer to the other translations subsequently as I am doing with the Gita.

('38', 357, 3, 4, 716190) ANASUYABEHN, I have your letter.
('38', 357, 3, 5, 716223) Stop worrying about me.
('38', 357, 3, 6, 716247) I am improving in health.
('38', 357, 3, 7, 716273) I shall stay in Nandi Durg as long as the doctors consider it necessary.
('38', 357, 3, 8, 716346) Afterwards I shall go to Bangalore because in June Nandi is quite cold, while Bangalore is moderately so.
('38', 357, 3, 9, 716452) Left to myself I do not want to travel.
('38', 357, 3, 10, 716492) But when it cools down a little and when I have improved my health, I should like to stay quietly in two or three places in Madras and Karnataka in order to collect funds.
('38', 357, 3, 11, 716664) No one sees any harm in short comfortable journeys in which I do not have to address people.
('38', 357, 3, 12, 716757) I have consulted many doctors but no one imposes restrictions such as those you suggest.
('38', 357, 3, 13, 716846) And if I may not speak, may not think and may not do anything at all, then for what purpose do you intend to save my life?
('38', 357, 3, 14, 716969) I have not so far developped such powers that I can lie in bed and serve by sheer silent thought.
('38', 357, 3, 15, 717067) Asking me to care for my health much more than the others generally do amounts to misusing me.
('38', 357, 3, 16, 717162) Dr. Mehta has not forbidden me from writing for Young India and Navajivan.
('38', 357, 3, 17, 717237) The only thing that everyone says is that I should not work at the same tempo as before.
('38', 357, 3, 18, 717326) And I cannot do that.
('38', 357, 3, 19, 717348) Certainly, I must do as much as I comfortably can.
('38', 357, 3, 20, 717399) What is more, Dr. Mehta believes that if I do not work as much as I can, I shall be completely bed ridden.
('38', 357, 3, 21, 717506) It is because of this I wish that none of you should worry too much about me.
('38', 357, 3, 22, 717584) I shall write to Panditji about Saklatwala.
('38', 357, 3, 23, 717628) What is his address in England?

('38', 359, 4, 8, 720882) Tell Vallabhbhai to give him a loan if it is possible and make sure that he accepts the loan only if he is capable of repaying it.
('38', 359, 4, 9, 721013) The documents are to be given to Ramachandra as they are.
('38', 359, 4, 10, 721071) They are to be given to him only to fulfil his requirements.
('38', 359, 4, 11, 721132) I believe it is necessary to pay off the debts due to West.
('38', 359, 4, 12, 721192) We have to write to him that the debts will be paid off gradually as the goods are sold.
('38', 359, 4, 13, 721281) How can Ramachandra himself pay?
('38', 359, 4, 14, 721314) The right over the patent is ours.
('38', 359, 4, 15, 721349) I have understood the dealing to be his way that we have to deal with the situation if West claims money from Ramachandra.
('38', 359, 4, 16, 721472) I have accordingly convinced Ramachandra.
('38', 359, 4, 17, 721514) If you want me to write to him to this effect, I will do so I have a letter from Shankerlal about handing over the charge to

('38', 360, 3, 8, 722055) NANDI HILLS (MYSORE STATE), May 10, 1927
('38', 360, 4, 9, 722096) DEAR FRIEND, Shrimati Anasuyabai has sent me your letter herself and your joint letter to her, Gulzarilal 1 and Desai.
('38', 360, 4, 10, 722215) I have read them both carefully.
('38', 360, 4, 11, 722248) I had your own letter also.
('38', 360, 4, 12, 722276) I could not reply to you earlier for want of your address.
('38', 360, 4, 13, 722335) As soon as I heard from Anasuyabai, I put myself in Communi cation with Motilalji.
('38', 360, 4, 14, 722418) I am daily expecting his reply.
('38', 360, 4, 15, 722450) You shall know it as soon as I receive it.
('38', 360, 4, 16, 722493) I thank you for the confidence you repose in me and it will be a joy to me if I can render any personal service to you; but I am afraid my longing and ability to render service have to stop there.
('38', 360, 4, 17, 722690) So far as our ideals are concerned, we stand apart.
('38', 360, 4, 18, 722742) 2 Whilst Anasuyabai and Banker as also Gulzarilal and Desai are absolutely free agents, they have exercised their choice of accepting my guida nce in framing their labour policy and administration.
('38', 360, 4, 19, 722940) I must there fore shoulder my share of the responsibility for what is happening about labour in Ahmedabad.
('38', 360, 4, 20, 723047) I have certainly advised them to keep Ahmedabad labour aloof from the other labour movements in India so long as Ahmedabad labour chooses to remain under their guid ance.
('38', 360, 4, 21, 723218) My reason is exceedingly simple.
('38', 360, 4, 22, 723251) Labour in India is still extre mely unorganized.
('38', 360, 4, 23, 723300) The labourers have no mind of their own, when it comes to matters of national policy or even the general welfare of labour itself.
('38', 360, 4, 24, 723431) Labourers in various parts of India have no social contact and no other mutual ties.
('38', 360, 4, 25, 723516) It is provincial and even in the same city it is highly communal.
('38', 360, 4, 26, 723582) It is not everywhere wisely guided.
('38', 360, 5, 27, 723618) 1 Gulzarilal Nanda, sometime Home Minister, Government of India 2 The addressee was of the opinion that the energies of all leaders should be harnessed towards an early inauguration of labour and industrial organizations all over the country.
('38', 361, 0, 1, 723861) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 361, 1, 2, 723903) many places it is under selfish and highly unscrupulous guidance.
('38', 361, 1, 3, 723969) There is no absolute cohesion amongst provincial labour leaders, and there is little discipline among sub leaders.
('38', 361, 1, 4, 724084) The latter do not unifor mly tender obedience to their provincial chiefs.
('38', 361, 1, 5, 724158) Leaders in different provinces have no single policy to follow.
('38', 361, 1, 6, 724222) In these circumstances, an all India union can only exist on paper.
('38', 361, 1, 7, 724290) I hold it to be suicidal therefore for Ahmedabad to think of belonging to it.
('38', 361, 1, 8, 724368) My own conviction is that Ahmedabad is rendering a service to labour all over India by its abstention, or as I call it self restraint.
('38', 361, 1, 9, 724503) If it can succeed in perfecting its own organization, it is bound to serve as a model to the rest of India and its success is bound to prove highly infectious.
('38', 361, 1, 10, 724663) But I am free to confess that there is as yet no assurance of success in the near future.
('38', 361, 1, 11, 724753) The energy of the workers is sorely tried in combating disruptive forces that ever continue to crop up.
('38', 361, 1, 12, 724857) There is the Hindu Muslim tension; there is the question of touchables and untouchables in Hinduism, etc.
('38', 361, 1, 13, 724963) Add to this extreme ignorance and selfishness among the labourers themselves.
('38', 361, 1, 14, 725041) It is a marvel to me that labour in Ahmedabad has made the progress it has during the last 12 years of its corporate existence.
('38', 361, 1, 15, 725169) If then Ahmedabad remains isolated it does so not selfishly, but for the sake of labour as a whole.
('38', 361, 1, 16, 725269) One word as to the policy.
('38', 361, 1, 17, 725296) It is not anti capitalistic.
('38', 361, 1, 18, 725325) The idea is to take from capital labour's due share and no more, and this not by paralysing capital but by reform among labourers from within and by their own self consciousness; not again through the cleverness and manoeuvring of non labour leaders, but by educating labour to evolve its own leadership and its own self reliant, self existing organization.
('38', 361, 1, 19, 725683) Its direct aim is not in the least degree political.
('38', 361, 1, 20, 725736) Its direct aim is internal reform and evolution of internal strength.
('38', 361, 1, 21, 725806) The indirect result of this evolution, when, if ever it becomes complete, will naturally be tremendously political.
('38', 361, 1, 22, 725922) I have not therefore the remotest idea of exploiting labour or organizing it for any direct political end.
('38', 361, 1, 23, 726029) It will be of itself a political power of first class importance when it becomes a self existing unit.
('38', 361, 1, 24, 726132) Labour, in my opinion, must not become a pawn in the hands of the politicians on the political chess board.
('38', 361, 1, 25, 726240) It must by its sheer strength dominate the chessboard.
('38', 361, 1, 26, 726295) And that can only happen if I can retain the intelligent and voluntary co operation of the workers in Ahmedabad and if our joint effort ultimately succeeds.
('38', 361, 1, 27, 726452) This is my dream.
('38', 361, 1, 28, 726470) I hug it because it gives me all the consolation I
('38', 362, 0, 1, 726521) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 363
('38', 362, 1, 2, 726564) need; and the policy I have outlined, you will recognize, is a direct outcome of my implicit belief in and acceptance of non violence.
('38', 362, 1, 3, 726699) It may be all a delusion; but it is as much a reality with me as life itself so long as I do not see it as delusion but see it as the only life giving force.
('38', 362, 1, 4, 726857) You will now see why I cannot, even if I had the power, respond to your appeal for dividing the funds collected by me in accordance with your suggestion.
('38', 362, 1, 5, 727011) But I may tell you that I have not even the power.
('38', 362, 1, 6, 727062) The funds have been collected purely for khadi work and it would be criminal misappropriation on may part to divert them to any other use.
('38', 362, 1, 7, 727201) This letter may not please you.
('38', 362, 1, 8, 727233) I shall be sorry if it does not.
('38', 362, 1, 9, 727266) But I regard you as a fellow seeker after Truth and if my reading of you is correct, there is no reason why my having told you the whole truth and nothing but the truth should not please you immensely.
('38', 362, 1, 10, 727468) It is not given to all of us to agree with one another on all our opinions; but it is given to every one of us to tender the same respect for the opinions and actions of our fellows as we expect for our own.

('38', 363, 8, 11, 728568) SISTERS, What you say about thieves is correct.
('38', 363, 8, 12, 728616) For the present, it is enough if you try to forget that you are weak.
('38', 363, 8, 13, 728686) You should on no account make the mistake of taking me to mean that men should give up their duty of protecting [women] .
('38', 363, 8, 14, 728808) Because woman tries to come into her own, man should not think that she has already become capable of protecting herself; a man, who by thinking so, fails to protect women, is nothing but a shameless coward.
('38', 363, 8, 15, 729016) He may be regarded as less than a man.
('38', 363, 8, 16, 729055) Man has kept woman in subordination and in a state of dependence; so it is his duty to protect her.
('38', 363, 8, 17, 729155) We are trying in the Ashram to make both men and women vigilant and self reliant.
('38', 363, 8, 18, 729237) But our goal is still far off.
('38', 363, 8, 19, 729268) Till then my trying to awaken and put courage into your heart is one thing and mens duty towards you is another thing.
('38', 363, 8, 20, 729387) So as long as there is one man alive in the Ashram, you should regard yourselves as fully protected.
('38', 363, 8, 21, 729488) There is no news of Surajbehn in your letter.

('38', 365, 1, 2, 730828) 370. LETTER TO FULCHAND K. SHAH Wednesday, May 11, 1927 I have your letter.
('38', 365, 1, 3, 730904) It is not satyagraha in the true sense of the word if people outside the State of Gondal agitate against the ban on entry of newspapers into the State.
('38', 365, 1, 4, 731056) People not belonging to the Gondal State can offer satyagraha there only when the cause of Gondal subjects is common to all the States and if success in the Gondal case would mean an improvement in all the other States.
('38', 365, 1, 5, 731276) Moreover offering satyagraha against a ban on entry of journals is like killing a buffalo for the sake of a thong or like citing scriptures for eating carrots while swallowing whole camels.
('38', 365, 1, 6, 731466) Even if the satyagraha in Gondal is to be offered by the State subjects they ought to have a stronger reason.
('38', 365, 2, 7, 731576) The Wadhwan well case is slightly stronger no doubt, but before you take it up you should be prepared to bear the loss of the school.
('38', 365, 2, 8, 731710) You should try some preliminary remedies, e.g., you should carry on negotiations, bring in the good offices of intermediaries, give the matter sufficient publicity.
('38', 365, 2, 9, 731875) You ought to prove that the ban is due solely to ill will.
('38', 365, 2, 10, 731934) In short, a satyagrahis case has to be self proven.
('38', 365, 2, 11, 731986) If there is any scope for doubt, if the other party has anything to say, a satyagrahi should hold his patience for the nonce.
('38', 365, 2, 12, 732112) If you look at all the occasions when I had offered satyagraha you will be able to see this condition as well as others.
('38', 365, 3, 13, 732233) You have rightly laid down the limit that satyagraha cannot be offered without my permission.
('38', 365, 3, 14, 732327) Observe this limit steadfastly, and obtain my written approval before starting anything.
('38', 365, 3, 15, 732416) This will be good for you and the principle of satyagraha will not be compromised by your action.

('38', 366, 3, 6, 732988) Give love Rajendraprasad.
('38', 366, 3, 7, 733014) Sug gest your emphasizing hand milling.
('38', 366, 3, 8, 733054) Have witnessed evils rice mills, inclu ding destruction of vitamins.
('38', 366, 3, 9, 733123) Warn public against unauthorized cables from South Africa.
('38', 366, 3, 10, 733182) The reader can see that the foregoing cablegram was sent in order that I may warn the public against accepting everything that comes from South Africa, unless it bears Andrewss own hallmark.
('38', 366, 3, 11, 733373) But I hardly think that the caution is required.
('38', 366, 3, 12, 733422) Naturally the public here will discount anything sensational that may come from South Africa, unless it is duly countersigned.
('38', 366, 3, 13, 733549) But let us hope that the Rt.
('38', 366, 3, 14, 733578) Honble Srinivasa Sastri will soon be on his way to South Africa, when all cause for alarm or anxiety will be set at rest.
('38', 366, 3, 15, 733700) Without, therefore, dilating upon the South African part of the cable, I return to the rice mills, whose evils have distressed him so much as to prompt the cabling of his opinion.
('38', 366, 3, 16, 733880) The reader will appreciate Andrewss anxiety when I inform him that he has to live whilst in India in the midst of rice mills.
('38', 366, 3, 17, 734006) For whereas when he first went to Shantiniketan near Bolepur, there was no rice mill in Bolepur, at the present moment several such mills are working in that once quiet place.
('38', 366, 3, 18, 734182) He often spoke to me about the din, the dust and the smoke and the fraudulent trafficking that has been going on in Bolepur since the advent of rice mills, and spoke also of the deprivation of a useful cottage industry by reason of the installation of these mills.
('38', 366, 3, 19, 734447) There can be no doubt that hand husked rice is infinitely superior to mill husked rice.
('38', 366, 3, 20, 734535) Medical men can, however, speak on the evil with greater authority than I can.
('38', 366, 3, 21, 734614) The moral evil of those mills stares one in the face, as soon as one goes to places where these mills have found a place.
('38', 366, 3, 22, 734736) In spite, however, of my knowledge of the evil of this growing destruction of cottage industries, had I not been bed ridden, I should not have undertaken the task that Andrews out of his good nature and out of the abundance of love that he has for India suggests that I should do.
('38', 367, 0, 1, 735017) 368 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 367, 1, 2, 735059) I regard myself as an economical worker, fully cognizant of my own limitations.
('38', 367, 1, 3, 735139) In trying to revive hand spinning I feel that I am touching the root of the evil, that it is enough to occupy all my energy, and that if that movement becomes successful, as I am daily becoming more and more convinced that it will, the undulated evils of rice mills, to which Andrews draws attention, and others which can be named will automatically disappear.
('38', 367, 1, 4, 735500) Let us not make the mistake of thinking that what has happened in India about the spinning wheel, and what is now happening about other cottage industries, such as hand milling of rice, need cause no harm to national life, because such things have happened in the West without the West having come to grief.
('38', 367, 1, 5, 735808) In the first place it is yet too early to say positively that the destruction of village life in the West has been either a benefit to it, or to mankind in general.
('38', 367, 1, 6, 735973) In the second place, and this is more pertinent, assuming that the new life that has come into being in the West is calculated to benefit mankind, let us understand that whereas in the West the villagers whose industry was destroyed readily found another occupation, and were, therefore, somehow provided, with us only an infinitesimal portion of those whom the erection of these mills deprives of their occupation is otherwise provided, and that the vast majority are left idle and penniless.
('38', 367, 1, 7, 736467) Let not the reader also rush to the conclusion that the hand spinning movement is an indiscriminate onslaught upon machinery.
('38', 367, 1, 8, 736593) This movement is intended to displace only such machinery worked by power as is harmful to the moral and material welfare of the starving millions.
('38', 367, 1, 9, 736741) The fact is that we are too much obsessed by the glamour of the West, and the ready made literature that is poured down upon us from week to week.
('38', 367, 1, 10, 736888) We forget that what may be perfectly good for certain conditions in the West is not necessarily good for certain other, and often diametrically opposite, conditions in the East.
('38', 367, 1, 11, 737066) Free Trade which may have been good enough for England would certainly have ruined Germany.
('38', 367, 1, 12, 737158) Germany prospered, only because her thinkers, instead of slavishly following England, took note of the special conditions of their own land, and devised economics suited to them.
('38', 367, 1, 13, 737337) And both England and Germany will have to revise their policy in economics immediatelythe nations that are now being exploited by them come to their own, and refuse to be exploited.
('38', 367, 1, 14, 737519) The civilization of both is based upon the exploitation of other lands.
('38', 367, 1, 15, 737591) Let us remember that even if we have desire, we have not the power to exploit any single nation on earth.

('38', 368, 1, 2, 737740) Hence if we are to live as an independent nation, we must evolve economics and conditions suited to our growth.
('38', 368, 2, 3, 737852) MOST ECONOMICAL
('38', 368, 3, 4, 737868) A friend, who fell ill about the same time as I became incapa citated, writing out of sympathy, and herself in search of it, says in her letter:
('38', 368, 4, 5, 738013) I had time to philosophize and there was one thought I was working at ever since I lost my voice.
('38', 368, 4, 6, 738111) And I have discovered that there is no necessity for living, and that Fate in giving us death early is most economical.
('38', 368, 4, 7, 738231) For thereby she economizes the power that abides in us whereas we waste it by living when living becomes manifestly unnecessary.
('38', 368, 4, 8, 738360) I spun the thought out until I felt exhausted, and I said to myself, After all what is the good?
('38', 368, 4, 9, 738457) The call somehow or other has not come.
('38', 368, 4, 10, 738497) And so I must be wasted till there is nothing more left to be wasted. 1
('38', 368, 5, 11, 738569) What a comforting thought it is to think of death, whenever it comes, as a wise plan in the economy of Nature?
('38', 368, 5, 12, 738680) If we could realize this law of our being and be prepared for death as a welcome friend and deliverer, we should cease to engage in the frantic struggle for life.
('38', 368, 5, 13, 738843) We shall cease to want to live at the cost of other lives and in contempt of all considerations of humanity.
('38', 368, 5, 14, 738952) But to philosophize, as this friend has done, is one thing; to realize at the required moment the truth of the philosophy is totally another.
('38', 368, 5, 15, 739094) Such realization is impossible without a due conception of the definite and grave limitations of the body and an abiding faith in God and His unchangeable Law of Karma.

('38', 368, 7, 17, 739286) 372. YOUNG AT 75
('38', 368, 8, 18, 739303) An English friend writes:
('38', 368, 9, 19, 739329) I want just to tell you of a letter and photographs I have had from a dear old Swiss peasant woman of over 70, who spins and weaves away up in the mountains above Villeneuve.
('38', 368, 9, 20, 739504) She writes in answer to letters that she has had of mine, and then she says (in French dialect), We are commencing the winter and the snows are coming down to keep us company for many months.
('38', 368, 9, 21, 739696) I shall have plenty of time to occupy myself with my loom.
('38', 368, 9, 22, 739755) And I have now got an order for two pieces at 59 metres,

('38', 369, 0, 1, 739875) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 369, 1, 2, 739917) so I shall need the time, as I get tired easily in these days (at 75 years old!).
('38', 369, 1, 3, 739999) Her life is a perfect example of the full, yet peaceful and contented existence, which should be the lot of all peasantry.
('38', 369, 1, 4, 740122) In the summer she works in the fields, with just a few odd hours of spinning and weaving put in here and there when the days are wet, and in the winter when the land is under snow, she works away at her wheel and her loom all day.
('38', 369, 1, 5, 740353) Take this hand industry away from her, and she would be lost in complete misery.
('38', 369, 1, 6, 740434) As it is, she is the happiest and sweetest natured person on the mountainside.
('38', 369, 1, 7, 740513) Because she alone, of all the peasants in that place, has retained the old industry, and she alone has a full and true life.
('38', 369, 1, 8, 740638) I enclose you one of the little photographs which shows her sitting on a log of wood caressing one of her goats, which may give you some slight idea of her dear old face.
('38', 369, 1, 9, 740809) The younger woman is her daughter in law.
('38', 369, 1, 10, 740851) I have the beautiful photograph which I am unable to reproduce in Young India, but the imaginative reader will have no difficulty in filling in the picture.
('38', 369, 1, 11, 741008) The point of the letter however is that even in that machine ridden country, there are people who find their true peace in this, at one time universal, home industry of the wheel and the loom.
('38', 369, 1, 12, 741201) And if this old woman, who for her industry is young at 75, finds her solace, not her livelihood, in the wheel and the loom, how much greater is their need in this land where very few women reach the age of 75, where the majority needlessly are old at 50, and where millions of women need not merely the solace of an innocent cottage industry to occupy their idle hours but who need it even more to keep the wolf from the door?
('38', 369, 1, 13, 741629) If that is so, why do not the millions take to the home industry, even as the dear old Swiss sister does, and find from it their solace and their food?
('38', 369, 1, 14, 741781) What is there to prevent them from doing so?, asks the ignorant scoffer.
('38', 369, 1, 15, 741854) But somewhat similar was the question put by a burly, rough looking Englishman to Surendranath Bannerjea in 1889 or 1890 when he was haranguing an English audience.
('38', 369, 1, 16, 742019) This worthy member of the firm of John Bull and Company asked the then uncrowned king of Bengal, if what the latter said was true that India desired freedom, what prevented her from taking it, how was it that they, members of this numerous and powerful firm, never heard of breaking of window panes, let alone heads, as they the members were wont to do when they could not get what they wanted?
('38', 369, 1, 17, 742414) So far as my memory serves me right, the papers recorded no answer from the orator.
('38', 369, 1, 18, 742498) There was only a hear, hear from the audience.
('38', 369, 1, 19, 742545) But what the honest Englishman said to Surendranath may be safely repeated even today, and we know that such a question will be no answer to the cry

('38', 370, 1, 2, 742737) for freedom.
('38', 370, 1, 3, 742750) We may not know how to win it.
('38', 370, 1, 4, 742781) Knowing the way we may not have the power or the will to adopt it.
('38', 370, 1, 5, 742848) Nevertheless the cry for freedom is both just and natural.
('38', 370, 1, 6, 742907) Be it ever so ineffective, it is the first step to freedom.
('38', 370, 1, 7, 742967) In the instance of the starving millions the scoffers forget in their ignorance that the millions have not even the wish to cry out for work or bread.
('38', 370, 1, 8, 743118) Hence we join the English historian in calling them dumb millions.
('38', 370, 1, 9, 743185) We (including the scoffers) have to be their voice.
('38', 370, 1, 10, 743237) We have to teach the dumb millions the first lesson.
('38', 370, 1, 11, 743290) We, not they, are responsible for their awful poverty and ignorance.
('38', 370, 1, 12, 743359) They dont know what they want or need.
('38', 370, 1, 13, 743398) They are living corpses.
('38', 370, 1, 14, 743423) Who shall dare say to the untouchables that if they want their freedom, who prevents them from taking it?
('38', 370, 1, 15, 743529) God is long suffering and patient.
('38', 370, 1, 16, 743564) He lets the tyrant dig his own grave, only issuing grave warnings at stated intervals.
('38', 370, 1, 17, 743651) We would say, and justly, that though the taunt of the English man could be theoretically justified, it would ill become Englishmen to beg the question in that manner, when anyone of us, though feeling helpless, is yet expressing the natural desire for freedom.
('38', 370, 1, 18, 743913) So will it ill become us, middle class men and women, to hurl the taunt put by me in the mouth of the imaginary scoffer in answer to the crying need of the millionsa need which they may not even feel but which a few of us feel for them.
('38', 370, 1, 19, 744150) The way to answer the need is to multiply the number of such representatives who would not only be the mouth piece of the dumb millions but would adopt corresponding measures by themselves taking up the wheel, by throwing away foreign fineries, by wearing khadi and by not resting till every idle hour of the nation is usefully occupied.
('38', 370, 1, 20, 744488) Then, but not till then, shall Indias women be young, happy and godfearing at 75, even as the Swiss sister of 75 is represented to be.

('38', 371, 1, 2, 744961) letter.
('38', 371, 1, 3, 744969) The contents of the letter and the distinguished names 1 attached to it speak for themselves.
('38', 371, 1, 4, 745063) I heartily endorse the appeal 2. But before I can formally give effect to it, it is necessary to ascertain the wishes of the donors.
('38', 371, 1, 5, 745196) In answer to the appeal issued in these columns and Navajivan, some sent their donations to the Satyagraha Ashram, some to the Navajivan, office, and some to the office of the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee.
('38', 371, 1, 6, 745411) The funds were sent from time to time to Sjt.
('38', 371, 1, 7, 745457) Rajagopalachari upon requisition.
('38', 371, 1, 8, 745491) Audited accounts were published by him in the papers.
('38', 371, 1, 9, 745545) The catastrophe was so sudden that it appealed to the imagination of the philanthropic public and a liberal response was made to the various appeals that were issued.
('38', 371, 1, 10, 745712) The result was that practically everywhere there was a surplus.
('38', 371, 1, 11, 745776) The agencies created were unable to spend the full amount with due regard to the proper discharge of their duties.
('38', 371, 1, 12, 745891) As the signatories to the following letter inform me, the other agencies have disposed of the surplus in some beneficial manner or other.
('38', 371, 1, 13, 746029) I have not been in a hurry to use up the surplus of the amounts received in answer to the appeal made in these columns.
('38', 371, 1, 14, 746149) It is deposited in banks and is bearing interest.
('38', 371, 1, 15, 746199) India is unfortunately a land of almost perpetual famines, and the chief activity of the All India Spinners Association at the present moment is directly to deal with such causes of famine as are within the power of man to control.
('38', 371, 1, 16, 746431) Man cannot control and regulate floods beyond a certain limit.
('38', 371, 1, 17, 746494) They will take their toll in spite of the exercise of all the ingenuity that man may be capable of.
('38', 371, 1, 18, 746594) But floods always leave a legacy behind, which man can and is bound to deal with.
('38', 371, 1, 19, 746676) In a similar manner man cannot bring water beyond a certain point when the rains fail.
('38', 371, 1, 20, 746763) But man can produce conditions whereby people who are willing to work can find work enough to buy food with, when Nature leaves enough scope for transferring grain from one place to another.
('38', 371, 1, 21, 746954) It is exactly these causes that the All India Spinners Association is endeavouring in a humble manner to deal with through its growing army of workers.
('38', 371, 1, 22, 747106) The method adopted is to establish spinning centres in places where there is the greatest need for work during off seasons.
('38', 371, 1, 23, 747230) The largest amount of such work is being done, as is now well known, in South India.
('38', 371, 1, 24, 747315) And the letter I have reproduced is a recommendation

('38', 372, 1, 3, 747807) When I made an appeal for directing the funds for use in Orissa, no subscriber objected and several wrote to me approving of the suggestion.
('38', 372, 1, 4, 747948) I now invite the subscribers, if they wish, to signify their own opinion.
('38', 372, 1, 5, 748022) In the absence of any opinion to the contrary from them within a fortnight of the publication of this note, I propose to utilize the surplus in the manner suggested by the distinguished signa tories.
('38', 372, 1, 6, 748222) Needless to say I have consulted all my co workers, and they approve of the suggestion.

('38', 372, 4, 9, 748362) According to my theory, if khadi work cannot be made a success in Utkal, it cannot be made a success anywhere.
('38', 372, 4, 10, 748473) Yet, strange though it may appear, nowhere have the khadi workers experienced a greater difficulty in organizing hand spinning than there.
('38', 372, 4, 11, 748612) The eyes of the living skeletons of Utkal are unlit by a single ray of hope.
('38', 372, 4, 12, 748689) What interest can the means of livelihood have for one who has despaired of life itself?
('38', 372, 4, 13, 748778) Those who have taken to spinning in Utkal are men who still retain some hope of life, The khadi worker there has not yet been able to touch the vast majority who have lost all hope.
('38', 372, 4, 14, 748960) The people are dying under our very eyes.
('38', 372, 4, 15, 749002) We could see it clearly if only we had the eyes to see.
('38', 372, 4, 16, 749058) We would then take up spinning for sacrifice and give away all our hoarded money for khadi work, or in case we had none, we would cut down our luxuries and superfluous expense and devote the savings to the same end.
('38', 372, 5, 17, 749274) It is only if we ourselves spin that we will be able to create the spinning atmosphere necessary to quicken these skeletons to life.
('38', 372, 5, 18, 749407) But a spinning atmosphere by itself cannot do more than merely touch the fringe of the problem.
('38', 372, 5, 19, 749503) Progress depends upon funds.
('38', 372, 5, 20, 749532) No yajna can be complete without dakshina 1. And it is clear to me as daylight that spinning is the one true yajna today and to contribute funds for its advancement is the only dakshina.

('38', 373, 4, 5, 749926) May 12, 1927
('38', 373, 6, 6, 749939) Again I have your two letters delivered the same day.
('38', 373, 6, 7, 749993) I am so glad you seem to have settled down.
('38', 373, 6, 8, 750037) But whenever you feel unsettled, you will not hesitate to tell me about it, as you now know from experience that I shall be patient.
('38', 373, 6, 9, 750170) I am most anxious that you should not appear to be what you are not.
('38', 373, 6, 10, 750239) I must take you as you are and help you to be what you should be.
('38', 373, 6, 11, 750305) That I can only do if I give you no cause to fear me.
('38', 373, 6, 12, 750359) That is why I told you once I wanted to be not merely in the place of father but mother also to you.
('38', 373, 6, 13, 750460) You will not leave the D.C. alone so long as he entertains your letter.
('38', 373, 6, 14, 750532) Answer politely all his doubts and queries.
('38', 373, 6, 15, 750576) Tell him if you know the difference between the Persian wheel which we have and the Ramachandra lift as also why spinning is not merely one of the industries but is the key industry of the nation.
('38', 373, 6, 16, 750773) There seems to be still some misunderstanding about my coming there.
('38', 373, 6, 17, 750842) I am anxious to be there for two reasons.
('38', 373, 6, 18, 750884) I want to see the place about which I have heard so much and I want to be with you.
('38', 373, 6, 19, 750968) But the time I do not know.
('38', 373, 6, 20, 750996) I am not likely to leave the South yet for four months, I fear.
('38', 373, 6, 21, 751060) But it is no use forecasting events.
('38', 373, 6, 22, 751097) I[t] should be enough for me to be able to say that I long to be there just as much as I long to be at Sabarmati.
('38', 373, 6, 23, 751211) Please gently tell Krishnanandji this thing.
('38', 373, 7, 24, 751256) Let Valunjker write to me.
('38', 373, 7, 25, 751283) You should get hold of the correct spelling of his name.
('38', 373, 7, 26, 751340) Let him write it [in] the Hindi character.
('38', 373, 7, 27, 751383) Are they making a long stay there?

('38', 374, 5, 6, 751746) NANDI HILLS (NEAR BANGALORE), May 13, 1927
('38', 374, 6, 7, 751789) LOWER HOUSE,
('38', 374, 7, 8, 751802) As I lie in bed and look up old undisposed of correspondence and revive old and sacred memories, I chance upon your letter of 27th February sent with Andrewss letter from your home at Inanda, and I revive so many pleasant and sacred memories.
('38', 374, 7, 9, 752045) Every letter that you have written during the last two yearsand you have not written manyhas been a despondent letter, distrustful of yourself; but as long as I live I am not going to lose faith in you.
('38', 374, 7, 10, 752248) I am hoping that some day as before you will have a fatigue of the exciting things that give you momentary pleasure and that you will at least come to India to meet an old friend and renew many old acquaintances.
('38', 374, 7, 11, 752461) You have made a provisional promise to do so next September or October.
('38', 374, 7, 12, 752533) Do come if you can and then stay as long as you like or as little as you like.
('38', 374, 7, 13, 752612) I am glad you are having short spells of Andrewss company.
('38', 374, 7, 14, 752671) I have not come across a humbler or more godfearing man throughout my varied experience.
('38', 374, 7, 15, 752760) You dont want me to say anything about my illness; because I see you do get Young India and read it.
('38', 374, 7, 16, 752861) I am at the present moment taking my cure in a little hill in the State of Mysore where an army of devoted volunteers and many of my closest co workers are looking after me.
('38', 374, 7, 17, 753035) Mrs. Gandhi and Devdas are with me.
('38', 374, 7, 18, 753071) The names of others would mean nothing to you.
('38', 374, 7, 19, 753118) So I do not give them.
('38', 374, 7, 20, 753141) But when you do come, you will see them all and recognize them as having been with me on this hill.
('38', 374, 7, 21, 753241) This loss of strength came in the twinkling of an eye.
('38', 374, 7, 22, 753296) Latterly I
('38', 375, 0, 1, 753307) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 375, 1, 2, 753349) had put such terrific strain upon the brain that I was afraid of a crisis and it came just when I was arranging to have a lighter programme.
('38', 375, 1, 3, 753490) But God seemed to say, I shall demolish your pride before you recognize your mad method and show you that you were utterly wrong in rushing as you have been doing, thinking that it was all well because it was for a good cause.
('38', 375, 1, 4, 753717) You fool, you thought that you would work wonders.
('38', 375, 1, 5, 753768) Have your lesson now and learn whilst there is yet time that God alone is to wonder work and He uses whom He pleases as His instrument. I am taking the chastisement I hope in due humility and if He raises me from this sick bed, I am making Him promises that I shall reform my ways and shall seek still more strenuously to know His will and do it.
('38', 375, 1, 6, 754115) I hope you are keeping in touch with Manilal.
('38', 375, 1, 7, 754161) He has got a girl with a strong character as his wife.
('38', 375, 1, 8, 754216) She is the best girl I could possibly have found for him.
('38', 375, 1, 9, 754274) Chance put her my way.
('38', 375, 1, 10, 754297) She belongs to a godly family.
('38', 375, 1, 11, 754328) Remember you are one of the trustees for Phnix and I look to you to discharge your trust.
('38', 375, 1, 12, 754418) Sastri will be in South Africa probably within a month of your receipt of this.
('38', 375, 1, 13, 754498) I have had long chats with him about you and your associations with Gokhale.
('38', 375, 1, 14, 754575) Do try to be close to him and bring all our old companions in touch with him.

('38', 376, 3, 7, 755032) What is however more to the purpose, I took imme diate action by writing in Young India.
('38', 376, 3, 8, 755121) And there was agitation against the despatch of Indian troops but as you are aware, we have no power.
('38', 376, 3, 9, 755223) I am now writing to the Association to the address sent by you.

('38', 376, 10, 19, 755687) You had given no address so far as I recollect in your cablegram; but I have a recollection that I sent you an acknowledgement to the place from which your cable was sent.
('38', 376, 10, 20, 755859) What is more to the purpose, I took immediate action and wrote strongly in Young India which I had taken for granted you regularly read.

('38', 377, 1, 3, 756170) But I am sorry to have to confess that Indian public opinion is not powerful enough to carry in such matters weight with the Government.
('38', 377, 1, 4, 756307) It has to be recognized that we are after all a fallen nation struggling to rise and therefore beyond wishing nations like you all success in their endeavour to attain full freedom, we can do very little indeed to help.

('38', 377, 5, 8, 756636) NANDI HILLS, May 13, 1927
('38', 377, 6, 9, 756662) DEAR MR. CLAYTON,
('38', 377, 7, 10, 756680) Mr. A. V. Thakkar of the Servants of India Society has sent me a cutting from The Times of India of the 4th instant containing the report of a debate in the Corporation in which you are reported to have said in reference to Mr. Thakkars investigation as follows:
('38', 377, 8, 11, 756943) Proceeding, the Commissioner said he was not going into the question of
('38', 377, 9, 12, 757015) general administration.
('38', 377, 9, 13, 757039) Mr. Horniman had referred to the investigations of
('38', 377, 10, 14, 757090) Mr. Thakkar.
('38', 377, 10, 15, 757103) Now, he (the speaker) had great admiration for Mr. Thakkar.
('38', 377, 11, 16, 757163) During the last ten years every opportunity was given to that gentleman to
('38', 377, 12, 17, 757238) make inquiries and once in conjunction with Mr. Gandhi.
('38', 377, 12, 18, 757294) The result was that
('38', 377, 13, 19, 757314) Mr. Gandhi reported that the class of witnesses was so unreliable that he could
('38', 377, 14, 20, 757394) not believe one single allegation made by them !
('38', 377, 14, 21, 757443) I shall be glad if you will kindly tell me whether you are reported correctly, and I shall thank you if you will kindly let me have a copy of the report which I am said to have made.
('38', 377, 14, 22, 757626) I do remember an interview or interviews with the late Mr. Turner in connection with the complaints of Bhangis.
('38', 377, 14, 23, 757738) But I have no recollection of my having made either in conjunction with Mr. Thakkar or otherwise any enquiry of the type suggested in the paragraphs quoted above.
('38', 377, 14, 24, 757901) I must thank you for the kind enquiries that you made about me

('38', 378, 1, 2, 758007) when Dr. Mehta visited me at Amboli.
('38', 378, 1, 3, 758044) As you know I am now taking my rest at the above hill which is a higher elevation than Amboli, therefore cooler.

('38', 378, 4, 7, 758262) 380. LETTER TO R. B. GREGG
('38', 378, 5, 8, 758289) NANDI HILLS, May 13, 1927
('38', 378, 6, 9, 758315) MY DEAR GOVIND,
('38', 378, 7, 10, 758331) I have your typed letter.
('38', 378, 7, 11, 758357) Though typewritten letters are undoubtedly easier to read, I have still a weakness for hand written letters.
('38', 378, 7, 12, 758466) This however does not mean that I want you to write to me in your own hand.
('38', 378, 7, 13, 758542) Your typewritten letters are quite as welcome as the handwritten ones and for the time being I have myself mostly to rely upon shorthand and the typewriter.
('38', 378, 7, 14, 758699) I have not yet got the book on vitamins.
('38', 378, 7, 15, 758740) If you had given me the name of the book and the author, I would have tried to procure it in Bangalore which I am sure has very good bookshops.
('38', 378, 7, 16, 758884) I shall look forward to your manuscript on khadi.
('38', 378, 7, 17, 758934) I wont discuss now the theory you have sketched in your letter.
('38', 378, 7, 18, 758998) Almonds I treated in two ways.
('38', 378, 7, 19, 759029) I had them roasted and pounded through a nutmill into pulp and took this in the shape of butter.
('38', 378, 7, 20, 759126) I had them also soaked overnight in water, the skin was removed and then it was pounded very fine, mixed with water and turned into milk.
('38', 378, 7, 21, 759264) This milk was warmed and raised to boiling point and then eaten.
('38', 378, 7, 22, 759329) Even this I could not digest.
('38', 378, 7, 23, 759359) This was however now nearly eight or nine years agoafter the attack of dysentery.
('38', 378, 7, 24, 759441) I have not dared to try the experiment again and after taking to goats milk.
('38', 378, 7, 25, 759518) But I should gladly make the experiment on my own responsibility if I had no other
('38', 379, 0, 1, 759601) 380 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 379, 1, 2, 759643) undertakings and should try it in spite of the other undertakings under skilled supervision.

('38', 379, 3, 5, 759854) NANDI DURG, Vaishakha Sud 12, May [13] 1, 1927
('38', 379, 4, 6, 759901) MANI, I have your letter.
('38', 379, 4, 7, 759927) You both did well to volunteer your services for patrolling the Ashram at night.
('38', 379, 4, 8, 760008) I wish you did it to the full extent of your physical capacity (even if as assistants to some other person).
('38', 379, 4, 9, 760117) Fear is a mere figment of our imagination; there is nothing real about it.
('38', 379, 4, 10, 760192) It vanishes as a result of facing it often enough and by the grace of God.
('38', 379, 4, 11, 760267) When the thieves realize that even our paid watchman will not beat them up but would suffer beating at their hands and that the volunteers belong to a different class altogether and are ordinary householders, they will cease to trouble the Ashram folk.
('38', 379, 4, 12, 760520) I am sure that someone of you will employ soul force some day and win them over by love.
('38', 379, 4, 13, 760609) But there is no doubt that this is like placing ones hand in a pit occupied by a snake.
('38', 379, 4, 14, 760697) Someone will be beaten up or even killed.
('38', 379, 4, 15, 760739) What man is there who is not afflicted by disease?
('38', 379, 4, 16, 760790) Men, women and children, all fall a victim to it.
('38', 379, 4, 17, 760840) How often was Radha knocked down?
('38', 379, 4, 18, 760874) What happened to Rukhi?
('38', 379, 4, 19, 760898) How many girls were taken to the Hospital at Juhu?
('38', 379, 4, 20, 760949) If we can stand it, why should we not also take a beating from thieves and others, with courage?
('38', 379, 4, 21, 761046) This idea may be strange for those who expect to be protected by the police but not for us at the Ashram.
('38', 379, 4, 22, 761152) I received the slivers prepared by you just as I was spinning and tried them at once.
('38', 379, 4, 23, 761238) The thread did not break even once, and today I have found out a way to determine the strength just by myself and no sliver has yet given me a thread comparable to that from you.
('38', 379, 4, 24, 761417) I have come across no sliver better than yours.
('38', 379, 4, 25, 761465) Equally good slivers might have come my way only once or twice before.
('38', 379, 4, 26, 761536) But I do not think

('38', 380, 1, 2, 761619) anybody can make better slivers than yours.
('38', 380, 1, 3, 761663) Indeed after once having tried my hand at yours, it may be difficult to spin with any other.
('38', 380, 1, 4, 761756) I wish and hope that you will be first in the first class in writing a good hand and in spinning as well as carding.
('38', 380, 2, 5, 761873) I had a letter from Karachi yesterday.
('38', 380, 2, 6, 761912) Your appointment appears to have been delayed on account of Narandass absence.
('38', 380, 2, 7, 761991) So they have asked for a months time.
('38', 380, 2, 8, 762029) I wrote that if they really wanted you, I would wait for a month longer, but they should do nothing just by way of courtesy or just to get you there, i.e., merely to oblige us.
('38', 380, 2, 9, 762206) I also asked for a reply by wire.
('38', 380, 2, 10, 762240) I would like you to go only to a place where you are really wanted; only this would be seemly.
('38', 380, 2, 11, 762335) We are in no hurry.
('38', 380, 2, 12, 762355) Meanwhile you have to become perfect in every department of your studies.

('38', 380, 8, 18, 762573) BHAISHRI JETHALAL, I have your letter.
('38', 380, 8, 19, 762612) If you persevere, you will succeed in your efforts.
('38', 380, 8, 20, 762664) In this age such efforts do not bear quick fruit, but hereafter you must observe this one rule.
('38', 380, 8, 21, 762760) Whatever the vow, once you take it, you must keep it.
('38', 380, 8, 22, 762814) You may pile up all the barricades you need for safeguarding [your vow] and for protecting yourself [against breach]; one of the essential and fundamental safeguards is this.
('38', 380, 8, 23, 762989) During the period of your vow, the two of you should live absolutely apart from each other and under no circumstances allow yourself any privacy.
('38', 380, 8, 24, 763135) If you have neither the inclination nor the strength to keep a vow, you may not take it, but having taken once you must abide by the necessary conditions.
('38', 380, 8, 25, 763290) You should go through Pandit Satavalekars book on brahmacharya.
('38', 380, 8, 26, 763354) His address is Oundh (District Satara).
('38', 380, 8, 27, 763394) A copy of the book has already come to the Ashram, from where you

('38', 381, 7, 8, 763689) DEAR MOTILALJI,
('38', 381, 8, 9, 763705) I must dictate.
('38', 381, 8, 10, 763721) Writing regularly with my own hand causes too much strain and it is not possible to sit up long.
('38', 381, 8, 11, 763818) This, however, does not mean that I am not getting stronger, but the strength comes very slowly.
('38', 381, 8, 12, 763915) And I do not want to be in arrears with such correspondence as I would like to attend to.
('38', 381, 8, 13, 764005) I prize your first letter as a gift.
('38', 381, 8, 14, 764042) It shows you in all your great ness and goodness.
('38', 381, 9, 15, 764092) You are living for your children.
('38', 381, 9, 16, 764126) I envy them.
('38', 381, 9, 17, 764139) But Krishnas 1
('38', 381, 10, 18, 764154) wedding must not be after Jawahars type.
('38', 381, 10, 19, 764195) It must be as humble as Sarups 2. Otherwise I must apply for a warrant of attachment.
('38', 381, 10, 20, 764281) Or, if I feel I must enter into collusion with Krishna.
('38', 381, 11, 21, 764337) I read the public printed report from beginning to end.
('38', 381, 11, 22, 764393) And I have now read the confidential report 3. Both are worthy of Jawaharlal.
('38', 381, 11, 23, 764471) I appreciate the view he presents about foreign propaganda.
('38', 381, 11, 24, 764531) But somehow or other I still feel that our way lies differently.
('38', 381, 11, 25, 764596) I feel that we will not get the support of Europe beyond a certain point, because after all most of the European States are partners in our exploitation, and if my proposition is correct, namely, that we must resist this exploitation in every shape and form, we shall not retain European sympathy during the final heat of the struggle.
('38', 381, 11, 26, 764932) However, for the moment my view is merely academic.
('38', 381, 11, 27, 764984) And you will vote Congress funds as you please.

('38', 382, 1, 2, 765188) The idea of Jawaharlal presiding has an irresistible appeal for me.
('38', 382, 1, 3, 765256) But I wonder whether it would be proper in the present atmosphere to saddle the responsibility upon him.
('38', 382, 1, 4, 765361) It seems to me to be a thankless task.
('38', 382, 1, 5, 765400) All discipline has vanished.
('38', 382, 1, 6, 765429) Communalism is at its height.
('38', 382, 1, 7, 765459) Intrigue is triumphant everywhere.
('38', 382, 1, 8, 765494) Good and true men are finding it difficult to hold on to their position in the Congress.
('38', 382, 1, 9, 765583) Jawahars time will be simply taken away in keeping the Congress house tolerably pure and he will simply sicken.
('38', 382, 1, 10, 765695) Till your letter came, I had no thought of interfering this year in the choice of the President.
('38', 382, 1, 11, 765792) My instinct still goes that way.
('38', 382, 1, 12, 765825) But, being out of touch, I may be taking too gloomy a view of the situation.
('38', 382, 1, 13, 765902) You know better.
('38', 382, 1, 14, 765919) And seeing that you are taking your head, and I suppose heart also, to Bombay, you will know the situation at first hand and guide me.
('38', 382, 1, 15, 766054) There will be still time enough to move.
('38', 382, 2, 16, 766095) I return Krishnas copy of Jawahars confidential report as also the first page of his letter.
('38', 382, 2, 17, 766188) I have only just received papers regarding Saklatvala which I shall go through in due time.

('38', 382, 5, 21, 766345) B. S. MOONJE
('38', 382, 6, 22, 766358) NANDI HILLS, May 14, 1927
('38', 382, 7, 23, 766384) DEAR DR.
('38', 382, 7, 24, 766393) MOONJE, I was looking forward to a copy of your address.
('38', 382, 7, 25, 766450) I have now received the same with your covering letter for both of which I thank you.
('38', 382, 7, 26, 766536) Acharya Gidwani wrote to me preparing me for the receipt of your address.
('38', 382, 7, 27, 766610) I had not read it but he told me that you had imputed to me a view of untouchability which I have never held or expressed.
('38', 382, 7, 28, 766733) And, when he told me so, I wrote to him saying that if you had done any such thing, it would not surprise me as your philosophy admitted of any means for beating an opponent with.
('38', 382, 7, 29, 766913) I have now read your address and I see that it confirms Acharya Gidwanis opinion.
('38', 382, 7, 30, 766995) I suppose it is unnecessary to tell you that the view you ascribe to me is not mine.
('38', 382, 7, 31, 767080) For, it is conceivable to me that you did not know my repeated declarations that I do not regard untouchability as is now
('38', 383, 0, 1, 767202) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 383, 1, 2, 767244) practised as a part of Hindu religion, and that if I could persuade myself that it was, I should disown Hinduism.
('38', 383, 1, 3, 767358) But this very palpable misrepresentation of my view does not affect our friendship.
('38', 383, 1, 4, 767442) For, mistaken though I regard your philosophy to be, love of the country is good enough bond between you and me.
('38', 383, 1, 5, 767555) Some day of course I expect to convert you [to] my view that it is a good policy even to treat an opponent fairly and justly.
('38', 383, 1, 6, 767681) And my conversion of you will be my contribution to the shuddhi movement.
('38', 383, 1, 7, 767755) Of course you want to know my opinion about your address.
('38', 383, 1, 8, 767813) I congratulate you upon your frankness and fearlessness; but the substance of your address makes no appeal to me.
('38', 383, 1, 9, 767927) Your address is a powerful and eloquent plea on behalf of Islam not as its best exponents know it, but as you know it, and if I do not know better my own Hinduism, I do not know what I should do.
('38', 383, 1, 10, 768123) You have also put yourself to immense pain in demonstrating that untouchability is an integral part of Hinduism, a view which I repudiate and have always repudiated in toto.
('38', 383, 1, 11, 768297) Happily for me, my Hinduism does not bind me to every verse because it is written in Sanskrit, because it is supposed to be a part of some of our scriptures.
('38', 383, 1, 12, 768455) If your portraiture of events is true and if your view of Hinduism is also true, the outlook is only gloomy both for Hinduism and for the country.
('38', 383, 1, 13, 768602) But let me tell you with all deference that in spite of your literal knowledge of the Shas tras, yours is a distorted view of Hinduism.
('38', 383, 1, 14, 768738) I claim in all humility to have lived Hinduism all my life.
('38', 383, 1, 15, 768798) But I cant convert you by argument.
('38', 383, 1, 16, 768834) And I know you will sweep me off my feet with a mere gesture if I endeavour to convert you by means of lathi blows.
('38', 383, 1, 17, 768950) I shall therefore be content with what I know to be the Hindu way and wait patiently for my opportunity.
('38', 383, 2, 18, 769055) Yours sincerely, DR.

('38', 384, 2, 3, 769203) NANDI, Vaishakh Sud 13 [May 14, 1927] 1
('38', 384, 3, 4, 769243) MATHURADAS, I have your letter.
('38', 384, 3, 5, 769275) Writing to persons like you is no strain.
('38', 384, 3, 6, 769317) Lately I have changed my way of working.
('38', 384, 3, 7, 769358) Instead of writing myself, I dictate letters lying down.
('38', 384, 3, 8, 769415) That way I am able to attend to more letters.
('38', 384, 3, 9, 769461) Write to Pattani Saheb regarding the bungalow and give him your last date.
('38', 384, 3, 10, 769536) If you wish, I shall write to him.
('38', 384, 3, 11, 769571) It is better to spend November December only there.
('38', 384, 3, 12, 769623) If all is well you may come down in January.
('38', 384, 3, 13, 769668) If you really wish to write about tuberculosis in Gujarati, go to a medical college when you are ready and study the subject without any desire for a degree.
('38', 384, 3, 14, 769826) Do you know that that is what Dr. Anna Kingsford did?
('38', 384, 3, 15, 769880) She also had tuberculosis.
('38', 384, 3, 16, 769907) While studying the subject, she discovered something altogether new.
('38', 384, 3, 17, 769976) She cured her disease by taking to vegetarian diet.
('38', 384, 3, 18, 770028) It is another matter that the cause of her disease was different.
('38', 384, 3, 19, 770094) You can also discover something.
('38', 384, 3, 20, 770127) Now for Pyarelal.
('38', 384, 3, 21, 770145) If you send away Pyarelal in a hurry, you will earn a severe rebuke.
('38', 384, 3, 22, 770214) I had decided for Pyarelal the programme that he should be with you and do his work.
('38', 384, 3, 23, 770299) Pyarelal is learned, yet is reticent.
('38', 384, 3, 24, 770337) Because of his undue timidity, he is not able to give of his best.
('38', 384, 3, 25, 770404) That is why I had given him the responsibility of writing regularly while he stayed with you.
('38', 384, 3, 26, 770498) In one of your letters you had mentioned that Pyarelal was feeling bored.
('38', 384, 3, 27, 770572) That is not true.
('38', 384, 3, 28, 770590) As soon as he came here, Pyarelal sought my permission to go back.
('38', 384, 3, 29, 770657) But I detained him because I wanted to have a leisurely talk with him and to cure his mental troubles.
('38', 384, 3, 30, 770760) Do not send back Pyarelal because you want to make the experiment of carrying on without help.
('38', 384, 3, 31, 770855) Discuss the matter further with Pyarelal and then write to me as you consider fit.

('38', 385, 2, 3, 771168) NANDI DURG, Vaishakha Sud 13 [May 14, 1927] 3
('38', 385, 3, 4, 771214) BHAISHRI CHINAI, I have your letter.
('38', 385, 3, 5, 771251) Even before this I got the news from Bhai Kalyanji and Pragjibhai.
('38', 385, 3, 6, 771318) Your letter however throws more light.
('38', 385, 3, 7, 771357) I congratulate you on the fortitude you displayed in receiving the blows without either returning them or running away.
('38', 385, 3, 8, 771477) I have no doubt that your action will bring benefit to you as well as to the people.
('38', 385, 3, 9, 771562) We should entertain no doubt about it just because we cannot ourselves see its good results.
('38', 385, 3, 10, 771655) I shall now answer your questions.
('38', 385, 3, 11, 771690) It cannot be stated categorically whether or not one may participate in the activities of the Hindu [Maha]sabha.
('38', 385, 3, 12, 771803) Those who are capable of having their own ideals implemented may surely do it, or those who are in agreement with the ideology of their local leaders will join them anyway.
('38', 385, 3, 13, 771976) I find nothing wrong with the Hindu [Maha]sabhas aims and ideals.
('38', 385, 3, 14, 772042) There can be nothing wrong in organizing a community.
('38', 385, 3, 15, 772096) Abolition of untouchability is everyones dharma.
('38', 385, 3, 16, 772145) Shuddhi is a very wide term.
('38', 385, 3, 17, 772174) A part of what it connotes may be acceptable to us, some of it may be rejected.
('38', 385, 3, 18, 772254) I think their manifesto gives no rigid definition of shuddhi.
('38', 385, 3, 19, 772316) People therefore have to make their own individual choice after considering the activities carried on in their respective province or city.
('38', 385, 3, 20, 772456) As a matter of fact you have therefore to act as directed by your own inner self in view of the local situation.
('38', 385, 3, 21, 772569) There is no absolute dharma that you must attend all the meetings convened by the Mahasabha, nor are you bound by dharma to take active part in any meeting which you happen to attend.
('38', 385, 3, 22, 772753) Dharma consists in undertaking an act only if it is likely to advance what one regards as ones dharma.
('38', 385, 3, 23, 772856) I would have no objection to taking part in a procession launched by the Hindu [Maha]sabha if it is done with a pure motive and not expressly with the intention to create trouble.
('38', 385, 3, 24, 773036) If we get news of a riot we should certainly exercise our strength, such as it is, in bringing about peace.
('38', 385, 3, 25, 773144) It is everyones dharma to make every pious effort to stop riots breaking out.
('38', 385, 3, 26, 773222) I employ the adjective pious with a purpose because in this age of cowardice men are presumed to be observing their dharma of peace by remai 
('38', 386, 0, 1, 773364) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 387
('38', 386, 1, 2, 773407) ning indifferent merely with a view to saving their own skin.
('38', 386, 1, 3, 773469) Thus by pious efforts, I mean, no one is required to check the riots at the cost of his dharma.
('38', 386, 1, 4, 773565) If there is an attack on my temple coming up and I just disappear or if I am advised to run away, neither I nor the person who counsels flight can be said to have been trying to stop the riot.
('38', 386, 1, 5, 773758) Social boycott can be justified in principle.
('38', 386, 1, 6, 773804) I have however never seen a clear reason for a social boycott of Muslims; nor is a general social boycott possible, as far as I can see.
('38', 386, 1, 7, 773941) Please do write to me if you need further elucidation.
('38', 386, 1, 8, 773996) I hope your pain has subsided; that Raiji too must be all right by now.
('38', 386, 1, 9, 774068) One of your doubts remains to be cleared.
('38', 386, 1, 10, 774110) There is absolutely no reason to believe that the Government has a hand in the functioning of the Hindu [Maha]sabha.
('38', 386, 1, 11, 774227) The Government, nonetheless, is wont to make use of every sabha or samiti with a view to consolidating their own position, as it does with the Hindu [Maha]sabha, the Muslim League and even the Congress.
('38', 386, 1, 12, 774430) Let Bhai Kalyanji and Bhai Pragji too read this letter so that I need not write to them separately.

('38', 386, 7, 19, 774734) It is good that you visited the Kanya Gurukul.
('38', 386, 7, 20, 774781) When you write to Champavatibehn, please ask her to keep me informed about the institution.
('38', 386, 7, 21, 774873) I am pleased that none of your girls is scared of the thieves.
('38', 386, 7, 22, 774936) I wish that we while at the Ashram do not live in fear.
('38', 386, 7, 23, 774992) If Surajbehn invites you to have a look at the Shravikashram at Palitana, do go and visit it when you get the time.
('38', 386, 7, 24, 775108) I think, however, that you were absolutely correct in expressing your unwillingness to stay there.
('38', 386, 7, 25, 775207) I would wish you to gain self confidence and be better trained, and your convictions to be more firm before you decide to serve individually.

('38', 387, 1, 4, 775549) I regard Surendra as an unblemished brahmachari.
('38', 387, 1, 5, 775598) It is very good that you have taken Ramanama into your heart.
('38', 387, 1, 6, 775660) This name alone averts all ills.
('38', 387, 1, 7, 775693) I am steadily improving.
('38', 387, 1, 8, 775718) For the present I propose to make it a practice to dictate my letters instead of writing them myself because of the temptation to deal with too many letters and also to conserve my energy.

('38', 387, 10, 22, 776621) 2. You will not try to seek relief in purely individual cases through him.

('38', 388, 1, 4, 777133) 4. You will remain completely united.
('38', 388, 1, 5, 777171) 5. You will put your own house in order and purify yourselves.
('38', 388, 1, 6, 777234) You will not assume that all your grievances will disappear with the coming of the Rt.

('38', 388, 1, 8, 777344) He will have done enough if he succeeds in seeing that no new restrictive legislation is passed against you, that the operation of the old restrictive enactments is not made unnecessarily harsh and that the spirit of the new Agree ment is carried out by the Union Government.

('38', 388, 1, 11, 777718) He is going there to uphold the prestige of India.
('38', 388, 1, 12, 777769) Therefore you will not run to him for relief in every individual case.
('38', 388, 1, 13, 777840) If you do, you will make the mistake of expending a pound for the matter of a penny.
('38', 388, 1, 14, 777925) Our strength depends solely on truth.
('38', 388, 1, 15, 777963) No matter how you behave in your business dealings, you will never in the interests of the community think of swerving from the path of truth in your dealings with the Rt.
('38', 388, 1, 16, 778135) Sastri.
('38', 388, 1, 17, 778143) In attempting to deceive him you will be working your own ruin.
('38', 388, 1, 18, 778207) We here constantly receive reports of dissensions amongst you.
('38', 388, 1, 19, 778270) If you go on creating different and conflicting interests, e.g., the rights of the rich as distinguished from those of the poor, the rights of the North Indians as distinguished from those of the South Indians, of the Colonial born as distinguished from those of the merchants, of the latter from those of the indentured, of the Transvaal Indians as distinguished from those of the Cape Indians and Natal Indians, you will lose the little that you have gained.
('38', 388, 1, 20, 778731) If you want to better the position of the whole community, you will always stand united.
('38', 388, 1, 21, 778820) We are ultimately to win by our own endeavour which does not mean sharp practice, but self purification, which again means reform from within and purging ourselves of evil customs and superstitions, educating our children, and contributing money for education as well as other measures of social reform.
('38', 388, 1, 22, 779124) In this work of self purification, the Rt.
('38', 388, 1, 23, 779167) Sastris profound experience as an educationist and reformer should be very helpful, and the presence of Mrs. Sastri should be an inspiration to our women.
('38', 388, 1, 24, 779322) You will never get such another opportunity in the near future of ameliorating your condition.
('38', 388, 1, 25, 779417) In my opinion it was impossible to
('38', 389, 0, 1, 779452) 390 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 389, 1, 2, 779494) find a worthier, abler and more impartial representative than the Rt.
('38', 389, 1, 3, 779564) Sastri.
('38', 389, 1, 4, 779572) Let us believe that the Hand of God has brought about this happy consummation.
('38', 389, 1, 5, 779651) It rests with you entirely to benefit or not by the chance which God has in his mercy given you.

('38', 389, 4, 9, 779812) RAMACHANDRA LIFT
('38', 389, 5, 10, 779829) The lift has now been in use in several parts of Gujarat since the management of it was taken over by the Satyagraha Ashram.
('38', 389, 5, 11, 779954) With reference to one that was recently put up in Palanpur, Sheth Amritlal Raychand Jhaveri writes: 1
('38', 389, 6, 12, 780056) I print the substance of the Gujarati letter received by me as preliminary evidence of the successful working of the lift, and in order to invite the opinion of others who have already got the Ramachandra lifts.
('38', 389, 6, 13, 780268) I should not have concerned myself about it but for its very great humanitarian aspect.
('38', 389, 6, 14, 780356) However, I am anxious to move cautiously.
('38', 389, 6, 15, 780398) I have heard some criticism about the lift and I invite all the testimony for and against the lift.
('38', 389, 6, 16, 780498) Up to now all the criticism that I have received has made no appeal to me; but if there is any criticism worth noticing I shall not hesitate to take the reader into confidence.
('38', 389, 6, 17, 780675) I need not repeat that the spirit of this enterprise is not commercial in any sense of the term.
('38', 389, 6, 18, 780772) Mr. Ramachandra Iyer has sold his patent rights for a royalty of Rs. 25 per lift up to 1,000. This was due to him as he has incurred considerable debts and as he must live.
('38', 389, 6, 19, 780945) But beyond that, nothing but actual expenses are added in counting the cost....
('38', 389, 6, 20, 781025) Those who desire to see the lift at work may visit the Ashram for the purpose.
('38', 389, 7, 21, 781104) Where the only object is absolute religious activity and pursuit of truth, there is no reason to hide anything.
('38', 389, 7, 22, 781216) The object of the appreciation printed above is thus clear.
('38', 389, 7, 23, 781276) If the lift has the merits described above then all must take advantage of it.
('38', 389, 7, 24, 781355) We started with only one lift in the Satyagraha Ashram and have now provided four lifts.
('38', 389, 7, 25, 781444) Out of these three are in working condition; but I do not

('38', 390, 1, 2, 781627) consider this to be sufficient proof.
('38', 390, 1, 3, 781665) If those who have bought the equipment are satisfied, and if they feel that because of this there is some saving of cattle as well as money, then nothing can be said against it.
('38', 390, 1, 4, 781843) It can be said that experience gained so far is in favour of the Ramachandra lift.

('38', 390, 11, 14, 782310) DEAR BROTHER, I must dictate this letter.
('38', 390, 11, 15, 782352) I forgot to mention one thing to you.
('38', 390, 11, 16, 782390) I think I gave you the name of Umar Hajee Ahmed Jhaveri, one of the most truthful men I have met in my life.
('38', 390, 11, 17, 782499) If he has thought ill of a person, I have known him to tell him so and apologize.
('38', 390, 11, 18, 782581) He is the brother of the very first Indian merchant who went to South Africa, the late Abubakar Ahmed.
('38', 390, 11, 19, 782684) Umar Hajee Ahmed has considerable property in Durban and has a plot of land with handsome buildings in a central place in Church Street, Pretoria.
('38', 390, 11, 20, 782831) This property was the only property registered in the name of an Indian in the Transvaal.
('38', 390, 11, 21, 782921) It became a point of honour with us to insist upon that property remain

('38', 391, 1, 3, 783157) Mr. Jhaveri was telling me that there was some dispute about it.
('38', 391, 1, 4, 783222) I dont remember the exact circumstances in which the matter stands at present, though of course the past history I know well.
('38', 391, 1, 5, 783348) This is a matter that might come before you.
('38', 391, 1, 6, 783393) You will then recall the fact that I mentioned it to you.
('38', 391, 1, 7, 783451) This is no individual matter but one of national concern.
('38', 391, 1, 8, 783509) There is correspon dence about this between General Smuts and myself.
('38', 391, 1, 9, 783579) You will see all the papers if the case ever comes before you.
('38', 391, 1, 10, 783642) I saw Dr. Malans cable.
('38', 391, 1, 11, 783666) It was splendid.
('38', 391, 1, 12, 783683) I am glad you are going so early as 8th June.
('38', 391, 1, 13, 783729) Poor Andrews is being torn to pieces, and you will not reach South Africa a moment too soon.
('38', 391, 1, 14, 783822) The Natal Provincial Councils vote is indeed a bad beginning.
('38', 391, 1, 15, 783884) But in the Cape Parliament the Natal vote counts for little.
('38', 391, 1, 16, 783945) I have no doubt that you will have no difficulty with the Natal members some of whom are good, and all of them, unlike as in the Transvaal, the Orange and even the Cape, are proud of the British connection.
('38', 391, 1, 17, 784152) But, probably, you already know all such things.

('38', 391, 5, 21, 784278) NANDI HILLS, May 15, 1927 DEAR FRIEND, Owing to my illness your letter has remained unanswered all this long time.
('38', 391, 5, 22, 784393) Do you still desire to leave the Excise Department?
('38', 391, 5, 23, 784445) And are you prepared to go to the Ashram and submit to its discipline without any pay?
('38', 391, 5, 24, 784532) Though you do not know cooking, it will be necessary for you to take part in the kitchen work.
('38', 391, 5, 25, 784627) What you do not know will be taught to you.
('38', 391, 5, 26, 784671) If you are admitted you will be expected to learn Hindi.
('38', 391, 5, 27, 784728) You will be expected to get up at 4 oclock in the morning and from 4 oclock till 7 30 in the evening you will be expected to take some part in the joint work at the Ashram.
('38', 391, 5, 28, 784901) Of course necessary leisure for ablutions, etc., is provided.
('38', 391, 5, 29, 784963) Thus you will see that before 8 oclock in the evening you will have little time for doing private reading.
('38', 391, 5, 30, 785070) There will be an hours rest during the day; but after strenuous labour, you will hardly feel up to reading anything.
('38', 391, 5, 31, 785187) Thus strictly speaking there is no such thing as 8 hours day in the Ashram for

('38', 392, 1, 2, 785309) volunteers who come under the Ashram discipline.
('38', 392, 1, 3, 785358) You will be expected to retire to bed at 9 oclock at night.
('38', 392, 1, 4, 785418) In fact one motto at the Ashram is that work for the common good is prayer and work is devotion to God.
('38', 392, 1, 5, 785522) If you feel that you can go through the Ashram discipline, please let me know and I shall forward your letter to the Manager of the Ashram with a recommendation to admit you.
('38', 392, 1, 6, 785697) Whether you may be finally admitted or not will depend upon the Managing Committee who has full control over everything in the Ashram.

('38', 392, 6, 13, 786112) If you join the training class, your own expenses will be paid, provided, of course, that you enter into an agreement after the training is finished to serve the All India Spinners Association.
('38', 392, 6, 14, 786306) If you show considerable aptitude, it is possible that you will get a pass certificate before the ordinary time and might then be admitted to the service at once.

('38', 393, 2, 4, 786807) BENARSIDASJI, I have your letter.
('38', 393, 2, 5, 786841) Before I got it, I had no knowledge of all that had been written from the Ashram.
('38', 393, 2, 6, 786923) You are no doubt aware that I am lying ill in bed.
('38', 393, 2, 7, 786974) I can only guess why such a letter came to be written from the Ashram.
('38', 393, 2, 8, 787045) Thus, as I have found Totaramji very systematic in all his work, this letter too must have been written at his instance.
('38', 393, 2, 9, 787166) If this is true you have no reason to feel unhappy about it.
('38', 393, 2, 10, 787227) As for me, I have full faith in your truthfulness.
('38', 393, 2, 11, 787278) But when a particular job....
('38', 393, 2, 12, 787308) 1 a man should willingly act in conformity with the common rules.
('38', 393, 3, 13, 787374) Whatever the best man does.
('38', 393, 4, 14, 787402) Again you may not be aware that a managing committee has now been formed in the Ashram and all business is transacted through it.
('38', 393, 4, 15, 787532) And it has relieved me of all my responsibilities after I fell ill.
('38', 393, 4, 16, 787600) Consequently it is implied that I should claim or exercise no prerogative.
('38', 393, 4, 17, 787675) If I have not been able to satisfy you even after writing all this please write to me what else I should do.
('38', 393, 4, 18, 787784) What are you doing these days?
('38', 393, 4, 19, 787815) What means have you adopted for earning your livelihood?

('38', 394, 1, 2, 788365) I am making steady progress.
('38', 394, 1, 3, 788394) Bangalore doctors came today and they found the blood pressure to be only 150 and the general condition quite good.
('38', 394, 1, 4, 788510) They now want me to eat more.
('38', 394, 1, 5, 788540) I shall see what is possible in that direction.
('38', 394, 1, 6, 788588) I have been obliged to omit bread and vegetable because I thought them to be too heavy.
('38', 394, 1, 7, 788676) I must now make another attempt.
('38', 394, 1, 8, 788709) But there is no doubt about my getting better.
('38', 394, 2, 9, 788756) I see you are making headway with your work.
('38', 394, 2, 10, 788801) How many women are there and how many girls?
('38', 394, 2, 11, 788846) How many men and how many boys?
('38', 394, 2, 12, 788878) Give me, when you can, a general idea of the Ashram and its inmates.
('38', 394, 3, 13, 788947) I do not know if anybody has told you that at Sabarmati of late we have been having much too much attention from thieves.
('38', 394, 3, 14, 789069) Once our watchman suffered bad injuries in a scuffle with them.
('38', 394, 3, 15, 789133) That woke me to a sense of our duty.
('38', 394, 3, 16, 789170) And I thought that this work of guarding was as much our duty as a common kitchen.
('38', 394, 3, 17, 789253) I therefore suggested that we must become our own watchmen and watchwomen and that we should seek not to beat the thieves out of the Ashram, but try to wean them from their error if they could be got at and that we should risk being beaten by them.
('38', 394, 3, 18, 789502) The suggestion has been adopted and there are now over thirty volunteers including five women.
('38', 394, 3, 19, 789597) This is a good begin ning.
('38', 394, 4, 20, 789624) The common kitchen is daily improving.
('38', 394, 4, 21, 789663) Shankaran has proved an ideal chief and chef.
('38', 394, 4, 22, 789709) There are over twenty dining at the kitchen.

('38', 395, 3, 4, 789973) SISTERS, I am very glad to know that you are not afraid.
('38', 395, 3, 5, 790030) A person who knows that God is the Protector of all, why need he fear?
('38', 395, 3, 6, 790101) By saying that God is the Protector of all, I do not mean that none would be able to rob or harm us.
('38', 395, 3, 7, 790202) If this happens, it is not a reflection on the capacity of God to protect us; it is an indication of our lack of faith in Him.
('38', 395, 3, 8, 790329) The river is ever ready to give water to all.
('38', 395, 3, 9, 790375) But if one does not approach it with a pot in which to fetch water, or avoids it thinking its water poisonous, how can that be the fault of the river?
('38', 395, 3, 10, 790526) Fear is a sign of lack of faith.
('38', 395, 3, 11, 790559) But faith cannot be developed by means of reasoning.
('38', 395, 3, 12, 790612) It comes gradually through reflection, meditation and practice.
('38', 395, 3, 13, 790676) To develop such faith, we pray to God, recite bhajans, read good books, seek the company of the good and take to sacrificial spinning at the wheel.
('38', 395, 3, 14, 790824) He who has no faith will not even touch the spinning wheel.

('38', 395, 13, 24, 791211) Why should you get hysteria?
('38', 395, 13, 25, 791240) Write me a detailed letter if you have the strength.

('38', 396, 1, 2, 791472) I am more and more convinced that when no other medicine works, fasting is a sure remedy.
('38', 396, 1, 3, 791562) Fasting does no harm, but dont try it if you dont have the courage.

('38', 396, 6, 7, 791767) SHANKERLAL, I have your letter.
('38', 396, 6, 8, 791799) I am steadily regaining the vigour.
('38', 396, 6, 9, 791835) Do not worry in the least.
('38', 396, 6, 10, 791862) I will try to take complete rest.
('38', 396, 7, 11, 791896) It would be good not to saddle Jamnalalji with more responsibility for the present.
('38', 396, 7, 12, 791980) Whatever the problems, I shall be able to take quick decisions and perhaps you too will be able to explain to me.
('38', 396, 7, 13, 792094) I am afraid Jamnalalji might fall ill.
('38', 396, 7, 14, 792133) I like Rajajis suggestion.
('38', 396, 7, 15, 792160) If you can work in the Nandi Hills for two months, the work can get done quickly and conveniently.
('38', 396, 7, 16, 792259) Houses are plentiful and so it would be no trouble for me at all.
('38', 396, 7, 17, 792325) Please consider and if you feel the need come over.
('38', 396, 7, 18, 792377) It would be good if you too could have some peace.
('38', 396, 8, 19, 792428) I had a fairly long discussion with Bhai Dhirajlal at Bombay.
('38', 396, 8, 20, 792490) He talked to me quite frankly and openly.
('38', 396, 8, 21, 792532) He wants to have training at Bardoli and then work in Bombay.
('38', 396, 8, 22, 792594) He does not seem to have found a clear direction yet.
('38', 396, 8, 23, 792648) But it is just as well that he should spend a little time at Bardoli or Sabarmati.
('38', 396, 9, 24, 792731) I have received Anasuyabehns letter.
('38', 396, 9, 25, 792768) She will definitely be coming to the Nandi Hills.
('38', 396, 9, 26, 792818) It will not cause any trouble or congestion for me.

('38', 397, 3, 5, 793234) How is it?
('38', 397, 3, 6, 793245) Quite some time has gone by.
('38', 397, 3, 7, 793274) Do you not wish even to change the treatment?
('38', 397, 3, 8, 793320) Totaram should write to me all the details.

('38', 397, 8, 13, 793489) NANDI HILLS, May 17,1927
('38', 397, 9, 14, 793514) DEAR SATIS BABU, When my illness is fast becoming a thing of the past yours seems to be obstinate.
('38', 397, 9, 15, 793613) Whilst it remains so, you must not stir out.
('38', 397, 9, 16, 793658) But why does it persist like that?
('38', 397, 9, 17, 793693) Are you undergoing any treatment there?
('38', 397, 9, 18, 793733) What exactly is the food you are taking?
('38', 397, 9, 19, 793774) I ask this question as Mr. Gregg has sent me a book containing the latest researches on food and its relation to health.
('38', 397, 9, 20, 793895) One thing does appear to me, however apart from the book.
('38', 397, 9, 21, 793953) May it be that your vegetarian food does not agree with your body that has been built up upon flesh foods?
('38', 397, 9, 22, 794060) While the change may not have done any visible harm, may it have undermined the constitution or may it be that the change of diet does not serve for rebuilding a shattered constitution?
('38', 397, 9, 23, 794246) So it happened in my case.
('38', 397, 9, 24, 794273) I went on famously on fruit and nut alone for more than six years.
('38', 397, 9, 25, 794340) But after that severe attack of dysentery I could not rebuild the body without milk to which in some shape or other the constitution was used up to 45 years or rather 40 years.
('38', 397, 9, 26, 794517) You know my rigid predilection, bord ering on fanaticism, for vegetarianism.
('38', 397, 9, 27, 794594) But my fanaticism exhausts itself with my own person for the simple reason that it is a mater of lifelong habit and of deep religious conviction.
('38', 397, 9, 28, 794740) But religious convic

('38', 398, 1, 2, 794894) tion is a matter personal to every individual.
('38', 398, 1, 3, 794941) Therefore, even being a vegetarian, I never enforce my conviction on friends but leave them free to do as they choose, even when they are under my influence, as I did for instance for Prabhudas, Chhaganlals son.
('38', 398, 1, 4, 795153) I had an English friend living with me in Durban.
('38', 398, 1, 5, 795203) He had become a vegetarian under my influence.
('38', 398, 1, 6, 795250) After some time he became ill.
('38', 398, 1, 7, 795281) I could see that he could not get on well without his usual diet.
('38', 398, 1, 8, 795347) I begged of him to procure meat from outside and become well.
('38', 398, 1, 9, 795409) I could not introduce it in my own home.
('38', 398, 1, 10, 795450) I want you to seriously consider the question therefore.
('38', 398, 1, 11, 795507) You have to think not only of yourself but of Nikhil also and even Hemprabha Devi if she is still as bad as you are and Tarini if he is a vegetarian.
('38', 398, 1, 12, 795657) If you are eating pulses, they are of course a fatal thing for weak persons and those with sedentary habits.
('38', 398, 1, 13, 795766) You saw with what agitation Andrews cabled to me all the way from South Africa about milled rice.
('38', 398, 1, 14, 795864) And my concern about your food became enhanced upon reading the book sent by Mr. Gregg.
('38', 398, 2, 15, 795952) If there is any particular book on Buddhism that you require please tell me and I shall try to procure it.
('38', 398, 2, 16, 796059) The paragraph about yoga in Navajivan was unfortunate.
('38', 398, 2, 17, 796114) I did think of yoga practices, but only from two sides, their reputed helpfulness in restoring health and in aiding brahmacharya, the latter for the sake of helping the student world whose mind is cut up to pieces under dissipating practices, and the former with reference to my own health.
('38', 398, 2, 18, 796405) Having read a book on brahmacharya, during my illness and having heard copious references to use of asanas I began further research.
('38', 398, 2, 19, 796538) I do not hope to get much help for acquiring greater purity.
('38', 398, 2, 20, 796599) Not that I do not need all that I can get, but I do not feel that I shall get it through these practices.
('38', 398, 2, 21, 796705) One who considers himself proficient in yoga told me that in their final stages Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Karma Yoga were one and the same and that it was only in the final stage that conquest of passions in every shape and form was at all possible; and that in Hatha Yoga the final stage was difficult of attainment and required extensive practice.
('38', 398, 2, 22, 797055) I was not surprised to hear this.
('38', 398, 2, 23, 797089) For, I knew it before I was so authoritatively told.
('38', 398, 2, 24, 797142) For that conquest therefore I have only to continue along the path I have so long followed.
('38', 398, 2, 25, 797234) But I am taking gentle exercise by way of some of these asanas and am eager to take more as I become stronger.
('38', 398, 2, 26, 797345) You need not therefore think any more about the yoga practices.
('38', 398, 2, 27, 797409) Some day in order to remove expectations and misunderstandings, I propose

('38', 400, 1, 9, 799333) I know that others also have faith in him.
('38', 400, 1, 10, 799376) His treatment consists essentially of injections in which he has profound faith.
('38', 400, 1, 11, 799457) I do not think he has talked to you about the injections.
('38', 400, 1, 12, 799515) But I can talk to him if you wish.
('38', 400, 1, 13, 799550) But I think that if he wants to give you injections and you want to take them you will have to stay at Ahmedabad.

('38', 402, 2, 3, 803055) I see an Associated Press telegram in the papers, in which Mr. Manchershah Awari is reported to have said, that he had my consent and full sympathy for his movement of civil disobedience with regard to the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act, designed for the release of the Bengal detenus.
('38', 402, 2, 4, 803352) If my recollection is correct, either the Associated Press repre sentative has misunderstood Mr. Awari, or the latter has misunder stood me.
('38', 402, 2, 5, 803493) I have no recollection of having given my consent in advance to Mr. Awaris proposed launching out on civil disobedience in any connection whatsoever.
('38', 402, 2, 6, 803643) It is really contrary to my practice to give such consent in advance.
('38', 402, 2, 7, 803713) I did discuss the theory of civil disobe dience with Mr. Awari, for whose patriotic spirit and self sacrifice I have great regard.
('38', 402, 2, 8, 803844) I drew his attention to the grave limitations of civil disobe dience.
('38', 402, 2, 9, 803914) He spoke, and rightly, with great warmth and concern about the Bengal detenus, and I remember having said, that if some move ment in the shape of civil disobedience could be conceived and successfully launched, it would be a great thing.
('38', 402, 2, 10, 804152) I hold that view even at the present moment.
('38', 402, 2, 11, 804197) For I regard the indefinite detention of the Bengal patriots without any trial of any sort as a grave injustice.
('38', 402, 2, 12, 804310) And if I have remained dumb, it is not because I do not feel the wrong as keenly as the closest friends of the detenus, but because I do not desire to make a fruitless exhibition of my powerlessness.
('38', 402, 2, 13, 804510) A public worker has to learn to endure with fortitude what he cannot cure.
('38', 402, 2, 14, 804585) And bed ridden though I am, if I could think of any feasible civil plan for securing the release of these prisoners, I should embark upon it without the slightest hesitation.
('38', 402, 2, 15, 804760) But I confess that I have none in view.
('38', 402, 2, 16, 804800) My own personal opinion is that there is no atmosphere in the country for civil disobedience.
('38', 402, 2, 17, 804894) We have fallen upon evil times.
('38', 402, 2, 18, 804926) The atmos phere today is one not of non violent disobedience but of very violent and suicidal disobedience.
('38', 402, 2, 19, 805034) I have no knowledge whatsoever of what is being done in Nagpur.
('38', 402, 2, 20, 805098) I can pronounce no judgment upon Mr. Awaris movement.
('38', 402, 2, 21, 805152) I have given no consent for the movement.
('38', 402, 2, 22, 805194) I had intended to say not one word about the movement, and it would have been well if Mr. Awari had not dragged in my name.
('38', 402, 2, 23, 805318) If he thought that his movement had my consent, he should have laid the whole of his plan in a concrete form before me and secured it in writing.
('38', 402, 2, 24, 805464) If I had approved of it and if I could not have taken an active part myself, I would at

('38', 403, 1, 2, 805594) least have backed it with all the force at my command through these columns.
('38', 403, 1, 3, 805671) He must now thank himself if my disclaimer harms his movement in any way.
('38', 403, 1, 4, 805745) And let it be a warning in future to everyone concerned against using my name in connection with any movement without my pre vious consent in writing.
('38', 403, 1, 5, 805896) Indeed it is necessary for workers to become self reliant and dare to prosecute their plans if they so desire without hankering after the backing of names of persons supposed to be great and influential.
('38', 403, 1, 6, 806100) Let them rely upon the strength of their own convic tion and the cause they seek to espouse.
('38', 403, 1, 7, 806193) Mistakes there will be.
('38', 403, 1, 8, 806217) Suffering even avoidable there must be.
('38', 403, 1, 9, 806257) But nations are not easily made.
('38', 403, 1, 10, 806290) There will have to be rigid and iron discipline before we achieve anything great and enduring, and that discipline will not come by mere academic argument and appeal to reason and logic.
('38', 403, 1, 11, 806477) Discipline is learnt in the school of adversity.
('38', 403, 1, 12, 806526) And when zealous young men will train themselves to responsible work without any shield, they will learn what responsibility and discipline are.
('38', 403, 1, 13, 806671) And out of this army of candidate leaders, will arise one real leader, who will not have to plead for obedience and discipline but who will command it as a matter of course, because he will have been tried in many a skirmish and will have proved his right to undisputed leadership.

('38', 403, 4, 16, 807000) Mr. Andrews in the course of a letter from Durban says: 1
('38', 403, 5, 17, 807058) I know the temple at Umbilo, which may really be called a suburb of Durban.
('38', 403, 5, 18, 807134) Even years ago, when the temple was erected, I had my misgivings.
('38', 403, 5, 19, 807200) Bitter experience has taught me that all temples are not houses of God.
('38', 403, 5, 20, 807272) They can be habitations of the devil.
('38', 403, 5, 21, 807310) These places of worship have no value unless the keeper is a good man of God.
('38', 403, 5, 22, 807388) Temples, mosques, churches are what man makes them to be.
('38', 403, 5, 23, 807446) I am therefore not surprised at the painful and horribly superstitious prac tices going on in this so called temple.
('38', 403, 5, 24, 807563) The origin of these practices is easy enough to trace.
('38', 403, 5, 25, 807618) There are three classes of Indians in South Africa.
('38', 403, 5, 26, 807670) The free Indian trader has nothing to do with these practices.
('38', 403, 6, 27, 807733) 1 Not reproduced here.
('38', 403, 6, 28, 807756) The correspondent had referred to the evil practices of self torture like fire walking festivals by Indians at Umbilo temple and to a page of pictures of such things in The Natal Advertiser.
('38', 404, 0, 1, 807947) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 405
('38', 404, 1, 2, 807990) Nor have the large number of Colonial born Indians who have received in the face of terrible odds a tolerably liberal education.
('38', 404, 1, 3, 808119) The third class is the indentured Indian, now become free.
('38', 404, 1, 4, 808178) He is drawn naturally from the poorest class here.
('38', 404, 1, 5, 808229) Nothing has ever been done by the Government or the employers or by the free Indian community to help these unfortunate men and women out of their ignorance and superstition.
('38', 404, 1, 6, 808404) The result is that they are preyed upon by superstitious and even evil minded men who pose as priests and holy men.
('38', 404, 1, 7, 808520) They mutter a few Sanskrit verses whose meaning they do not know and which they horribly mispronounce, and resort to all kinds of awe inspiring practices.
('38', 404, 1, 8, 808675) And what can be better than a temple, where simple people congregate and where every kind of superstition derives a halo from associations attributed to temples?
('38', 404, 1, 9, 808837) I think that the common law of South Africa is wide enough to deal with these prac tices if the Government desires to put them down.
('38', 404, 1, 10, 808970) The fact is, unfortunately, that the prejudice against Indians in South Africa is not ascribable to these practices, nor is it directed against the men who are victims of this barbarism.
('38', 404, 1, 11, 809157) It is directed chiefly against the free trading class who have nothing to do with these practices.
('38', 404, 1, 12, 809256) And therefore these practices have gone without any notice or comment.
('38', 404, 1, 13, 809327) And if they are now being noticed, it is in order to prejudice the European mind against the Habibullah Agreement and against what little relief is sought to be given by it to the Indian settlers.
('38', 404, 1, 14, 809524) It should also be borne in mind that these practices are by no means common amongst Indians throughout South Africa.
('38', 404, 1, 15, 809641) They are confined only to the part of the coast of Natal where indentured Indians are to be found in their largest numbers.
('38', 404, 1, 16, 809765) If therefore the Government intend to put these practices down, they can do so under the common law with ease, and they can be dealt with also through municipal bye laws.
('38', 404, 1, 17, 809936) I am sure, that if action is taken, not a voice will be raised against it in the name of religion falsely so called for sheltering these practices.
('38', 404, 1, 18, 810084) No cultured Indian will have anything to do with them, and the ignorant people who witness these tortures with awe will not dare to defend them in a court of law.
('38', 404, 1, 19, 810247) What we can do here is to encourage cultured Indians in South Africa to fight the superstition.
('38', 404, 1, 20, 810343) They should, without seeking Government intervention, work in the midst of the poor people, and wean them from these barbarisms, and advise them to help the Government, if they choose to prosecute those who take part in those practices, thus showing their desire not to reproduce in South Africa all that is bad in our life, but

('38', 405, 1, 3, 810772) It is our duty to advise and encourage our countrymen in South Africa to do nothing that will give a handle to the agitation against them.

('38', 405, 4, 6, 810966) NANDI HILLS (MYSORE STATE), May 19, 1927
('38', 405, 5, 7, 811007) DEAR SATCOWRI BABU, I got your letter day before yesterday after that days mail was closed.
('38', 405, 5, 8, 811099) I could not possibly over take your letter yesterday.
('38', 405, 5, 9, 811153) You have my deepest sympathy with you in your troubles.
('38', 405, 5, 10, 811209) But I have much fear it is out of my power to help you in the direction desired by you.
('38', 405, 5, 11, 811297) All the same please let me have a full description of your property, where it is situated, what is its extent, whether there are any buildings on it and if there are, their dimensions.
('38', 405, 5, 12, 811482) Possession of this information will be useful for me.
('38', 405, 5, 13, 811536) But your case is not out of the ordinary.
('38', 405, 5, 14, 811578) I know many who are passing through the same difficulty.
('38', 405, 5, 15, 811635) It is also one of the things we have to go through in our march towards our goal.
('38', 405, 5, 16, 811717) And I want you to bear your troubles with philoso phic calmness as I know you will do.
('38', 405, 5, 17, 811804) But why do you say insolvency is not to be thought of?
('38', 405, 5, 18, 811859) Honest insolvency is no crime if a borrower [borrows] in good faith for investing in a prosperous enterprise.
('38', 405, 5, 19, 811969) Suppose that through no fault of my own the enterprise fails and the loaner knew that I had no other means of repayment.
('38', 405, 5, 20, 812090) Surely if he is impatient, insolvency is the only honourable course left open for me even if I desired as I should to repay the loan in spite of insolvency.
('38', 405, 5, 21, 812247) For, insolvency would be the only way of my doing further business.
('38', 405, 5, 22, 812315) As a lawyer you know the genesis of insolvency law.
('38', 405, 5, 23, 812367) It was created to protect honest but unlucky enterprise and to encourage trade and enterprise.
('38', 405, 5, 24, 812462) No doubt the golden rule is not to borrow.
('38', 405, 5, 25, 812505) But so few of us follow the golden rule.
('38', 405, 5, 26, 812546) The next best therefore is not to accept a defeat but to seek the protection of the insolvency court and open a new leaf, and if successful, in the next enterprise, repay of ones own free will the original loaner.
('38', 405, 5, 27, 812760) There are such celebrated instances of men having deliberately become insolvent and then repaid their creditors.
('38', 405, 5, 28, 812873) In my own practice, I advised
('38', 406, 0, 1, 812903) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 407
('38', 406, 1, 2, 812946) one of my nearest clients 1, who because he had taken part in the satyagraha movement, was forced into the insolvency court.
('38', 406, 1, 3, 813071) I called a meeting of the debtors.
('38', 406, 1, 4, 813106) They were unbending.
('38', 406, 1, 5, 813127) I challenged them to do their worst.
('38', 406, 1, 6, 813164) The consequence was insolvency.
('38', 406, 1, 7, 813196) But after the insol vency, the client paid the creditors in full to their agreeable astonish ment.
('38', 406, 1, 8, 813295) They apologized and they showed their sincerity by giving him afterwards unlimited credit which they had no occasion to regret.
('38', 406, 1, 9, 813423) I therefore strongly advise you to meet the creditors, place the position frankly and fearlessly before them and tell them that you will repay if you earned.
('38', 406, 1, 10, 813581) If they dont listen, let them make you insolvent, or if the insolvency law here admits of voluntary surrender you may even surrender voluntarily.
('38', 406, 1, 11, 813727) Then you will have breathing time and then if you do not want to resume practice, you will join the Khadi Service.
('38', 406, 1, 12, 813842) Khadi Service will never give you Rs. 25,000. But if the movement goes forward with a leap, khadi will become a commercial proposition, and when it does become that, there will be a moderate amount of money in it also.
('38', 406, 1, 13, 814061) This may seem to be all far fetched; not so to me.
('38', 406, 1, 14, 814112) I regard khadi as a far sounder proposition even from a commercial standpoint than the least that can be made by our merchant princes.
('38', 406, 1, 15, 814247) After all sound commerce is of slow growth.
('38', 406, 1, 16, 814291) But my confidence in khadi is such that, though it is of slow growth, in the long run, it will prove to be the shortest route to healthy commercial prosperity of individuals as it certainly will be of the nation.
('38', 406, 1, 17, 814504) I do not want you [to] succumb therefore under the influence of false pride or [a] false sense of honour.
('38', 406, 1, 18, 814610) I want you to be a pattern for others, and therefore please follow my advice and get rid of the burden which is evidently bearing you down.
('38', 406, 1, 19, 814750) Then make a firm resolution not to borrow a single farthing henceforth.
('38', 406, 1, 20, 814822) Public workers must not borrow.
('38', 406, 1, 21, 814854) And insist upon your numerous family dependants to work for their livelihood and let them all work for khadi, and if they dont want to do that, the male members may make their own choice; females may grumble but will submit to the inevitable.
('38', 406, 1, 22, 815097) This regulation of family obligations is also a necessary corollary to national uplift.
('38', 406, 1, 23, 815185) We must break through this family crust if we are to grow to our national height.
('38', 406, 1, 24, 815267) These falsely assumed obligations I know are hampering the progress of individuals and the nation in a way very few things are doing.
('38', 406, 1, 25, 815401) It is wrong, I almost want to say immoral, to support men and women who have some capacity for work.

('38', 408, 3, 4, 817364) CHHAGANLAL, You write it would be better if Manibehn stayed [at the Ashram] instead of going over to Karachi.
('38', 408, 3, 5, 817474) God alone knows whether or not she would have the opportunity to go.
('38', 408, 3, 6, 817543) But if she is not to go there, still she has to be sent out somewhere because I wonder if she has yet developed any attachment to the Ashram.
('38', 408, 3, 7, 817685) The girl is extremely candid and honest; so wherever she is, she is sure to do the work, but it is for you all to create in her affection and interest.
('38', 408, 3, 8, 817837) Do keep her there if you can.
('38', 408, 3, 9, 817867) And if this is possible [for the time being], I need not arrange to send her elsewhere.
('38', 408, 3, 10, 817955) I would let the [chance] at Karachi materialize if it is to happen.
('38', 408, 3, 11, 818023) But She can also be called back from there after a short period.

('38', 408, 10, 20, 818449) It has always been my view that we should on no account bring in the British Government to mediate in the affairs of the native States.
('38', 408, 10, 21, 818585) But we cannot say that this principle is to be followed on every occasion, because as I expect a man who would neither ask for nor want the mediation of the British to possess the strength to resist oppression peacefully or otherwise or acquire the capacity to suffer it silently.

('38', 410, 2, 3, 819978) ASHRAM, SABARMATI, 1 May 20, 1927
('38', 410, 3, 4, 820012) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('38', 410, 3, 5, 820067) Besides the writings mentioned by you, there is a monograph by the late Rev.
('38', 410, 3, 6, 820144) Joseph Doke, also by Dr. P. J. Mehta, and by H. S. L. Polak besides other writings collected by G. A. Natesan and copies of Young India since 1922, and my booklet called Indian Home Rule 2. Most of these publications I think can be secured from G. A. Natesan of the Indian Review, Madras.
('38', 410, 3, 7, 820433) Young India is edited by me and is published at Ahmedabad.
('38', 410, 3, 8, 820492) Ethical Religion is not an original book.
('38', 410, 3, 9, 820534) It is a translation of an adaptation in Gujarati of an American publication called Ethics of Religion by Salter which I read years ago.
('38', 410, 3, 10, 820670) In its translated form I have not read it.
('38', 410, 3, 11, 820713) It will be therefore risky to derive a knowledge of my belief through that book.
('38', 410, 3, 12, 820794) If you desire any further information, you will [not] hesitate, please ask for it.
('38', 410, 3, 13, 820877) I thank you for your enquiry about my health which is steadily improving.
('38', 410, 4, 14, 820951) Yours sincerely,

('38', 410, 8, 19, 821098) Even if you have nothing to write, you will not be excused from writing once a week.
('38', 410, 8, 20, 821183) At least I can certainly hope to see the improvement in your handwriting.
('38', 410, 8, 21, 821257) And if you find nothing to write, just say what you did on that day (or on the previous day).

('38', 411, 2, 5, 821717) I certainly like the idea of opening a school for Antyaja girls and I know very well that you have stayed back only for that reason.
('38', 411, 2, 6, 821850) My health is picking up.
('38', 411, 2, 7, 821875) I have increased the duration of my walks.
('38', 411, 2, 8, 821918) I have begun taking a little bread and butter.
('38', 411, 2, 9, 821965) I have given up one fruit and instead introduced some green vegetable in my diet.
('38', 411, 2, 10, 822047) I shall observe the result.
('38', 411, 2, 11, 822075) Jamnalal and Rajendrababu arrived here today.

('38', 412, 3, 5, 822921) DEAR DR.
('38', 412, 3, 6, 822930) ANSARI, I was grieved to hear of your illness.
('38', 412, 3, 7, 822977) I hope you will soon recover.
('38', 412, 3, 8, 823007) Why not come here to regain your strength?
('38', 412, 3, 9, 823050) The climate here as you know is very nice.
('38', 412, 3, 10, 823093) Somehow or other the resolution 1 of the A.I.C.C. does not fill me with immediate hope, much less, enthusiasm.
('38', 412, 3, 11, 823204) The hope deep down which is born of implicit faith is there.
('38', 412, 3, 12, 823265) But it receives no added impulse from the resolution.
('38', 412, 3, 13, 823319) For, I feel the few who have a detached mind and who are keeping their heads cool, can produce at present no impression upon those who are fighting or those who are at the back of the fighters.
('38', 412, 3, 14, 823513) I dont know if you think that you have any influence.
('38', 412, 3, 15, 823567) I see nothing but devilry going on under the garb of religion.
('38', 412, 3, 16, 823630) Not until we learn to become men and therefore instead of breaking heads for the vindication of supposed rights, we learn to refer to arbitration matters even of attacks upon our rights supposed or real and until we cease to think of Government interference, shall we have real peace or real swaraj.
('38', 412, 3, 17, 823930) Anything short of that gives me no satisfaction.
('38', 412, 3, 18, 823979) My only hope therefore lies in prayer and answer to prayer.
('38', 412, 4, 19, 824039) Yours sincerely, DR.

('38', 412, 8, 25, 824202) You have surely heard the song with this first line Never give up, even it you lose your life.

('38', 413, 1, 2, 824453) never lose heart.
('38', 413, 1, 3, 824471) And where is the sense in admitting defeat as regards spinning, for instance, and writing a good hand, especially when I am by your side to encourage you?
('38', 413, 1, 4, 824626) Stone upon stone a dam is built and drop by drop the lake filled up. Nothing is impossible for the industrious.
('38', 413, 1, 5, 824738) So do not lose heart.
('38', 413, 1, 6, 824760) By regular spinning you are sure to increase your speed and you will improve your hand by constant practice in writing clear and bold letters.
('38', 413, 1, 7, 824903) I know of a great many people who have thus improved their handwriting.
('38', 413, 1, 8, 824975) You have done well in taking up the work of the Ashram stores.
('38', 413, 1, 9, 825038) Now do not give it up but do it perfectly.
('38', 413, 1, 10, 825081) Never mind if you dont have to keep accounts, but you should acquaint yourself with the general principles.
('38', 413, 1, 11, 825189) If this work takes up so much of your time that you cannot spin for two hours every day, you may spin for a shorter period but with concentration.
('38', 413, 1, 12, 825336) It is better to spin for a short time with application than to spin longer and impatiently; for you will thus spin stronger and more uniform yarn and that too faster.
('38', 413, 1, 13, 825503) Do keep me informed about Gangadevi.

('38', 413, 6, 18, 825652) MAGANLAL, I have your letter.
('38', 413, 6, 19, 825682) I have read your letter to Jamnalal and also those to Chhaganlal.
('38', 413, 6, 20, 825748) I understand about Ramachandra and Ganesh.
('38', 413, 6, 21, 825791) Do what all of you think proper.
('38', 413, 7, 22, 825824) It occurs to me that there is one thing I should write to you about.
('38', 413, 7, 23, 825893) Ramchandra and Ganesh are both good and honest persons.
('38', 413, 7, 24, 825949) Such persons should be retained if possible.
('38', 413, 7, 25, 825994) But while they are retained, we must be firm with them as well as gentle.
('38', 413, 7, 26, 826068) We should not have the slightest hesitation in pointing out their faults.
('38', 413, 7, 27, 826142) That is what I mean by firmness.
('38', 413, 7, 28, 826175) You must frankly tell Ramchandra: You exaggerate.
('38', 413, 7, 29, 826225) You are hasty and hot tempered and never willing to see your own faults.
('38', 413, 7, 30, 826298) You can stay here only by recognizing those faults and overcoming them.
('38', 413, 7, 31, 826370) It is no use appealing to Gandhi, because he has delegated all powers to us. If he stays on even after such frank
('38', 414, 0, 1, 826484) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 415
('38', 414, 1, 2, 826527) talk, he should be allowed to stay and if he wishes to go, he should be allowed to go, whatever the inconvenience caused thereby.
('38', 414, 1, 3, 826657) You must also tell Ganesh frankly: We suspect that you do not wish to teach the others the craft you know.
('38', 414, 1, 4, 826764) We can carry on only if you teach others and train them.
('38', 414, 1, 5, 826821) If not, you are free to go.
('38', 414, 1, 6, 826849) But we shall not drive you away if you should wish to continue here even after you have trained somebody.
('38', 414, 1, 7, 826955) You will continue to receive the help you are having today.
('38', 414, 1, 8, 827015) We want you to stay.
('38', 414, 1, 9, 827036) But you can stay only on our conditions. In other words, firmness lies in telling a person what we think about him.
('38', 414, 1, 10, 827152) We should be gentle in conveying this and it should not be an expression of hasty judgment.
('38', 414, 1, 11, 827244) Gentleness also means an effort to see whatever good may be seen in a fault.
('38', 414, 1, 12, 827321) But ultimately, we can proceed correctly and carry on our work only when we have fully expressed our view about a fault of which we are convinced.
('38', 414, 1, 13, 827468) Then alone can we consider ourselves true satyagrahis.
('38', 414, 1, 14, 827523) I see that relations among people are not smooth.
('38', 414, 1, 15, 827573) At present there is hesitation in frankly expressing our views on the faults of others which are clear to us.
('38', 414, 1, 16, 827683) If that veil of hesitation is removed, much of the work can become easy.
('38', 414, 1, 17, 827756) This is intended only by way of guidance.
('38', 414, 2, 18, 827798) I am returning the letter from Ramachandra in case it is of use to you.

('38', 414, 9, 26, 828125) He has conveyed your message to me.
('38', 414, 9, 27, 828161) I can think of nothing further to write to you than what I have already done.
('38', 414, 9, 28, 828239) Regarding an audience with the Emperor I think you should not try for one.
('38', 414, 9, 29, 828314) You should not, however, refuse it if the Secretary of State for India or the Prime Minister proposes to arrange it.
('38', 414, 9, 30, 828431) As far as I know I think political matters are not discussed with the British Monarch.

('38', 415, 1, 4, 828660) Observe closely the British jails and also visit the poorer districts of London with some knowledgeable person and study the condition of the poor.

('38', 415, 3, 9, 829067) But he does send a telegram in reply to one.
('38', 415, 3, 10, 829112) I am going to write to him again all the same.

('38', 415, 8, 14, 829247) 421. HE SHOULD BE DISMISSED
('38', 415, 9, 15, 829275) I have now got the name and the address of the doctor, the account of whose inhuman treatment of an Antyaja woman was given to us by Shri Amritlal Thakkar.
('38', 415, 9, 16, 829431) 1 Now an inquiry is being made into the case and in the mean time I do not see any necessity of disclosing his identity.
('38', 415, 9, 17, 829552) A well known doctor friend writes : 2
('38', 415, 10, 18, 829590) My reason for publishing this letter is that the inhuman treatment of the Antyaja woman was such as no one can possibly condone.
('38', 415, 10, 19, 829719) I do not believe that if the doctor is a private practitioner, the only alternatives before us are to grieve over the incident in helpless silence, if we wish to follow the path of non violence, or, if not, give the doctor a thrashing.
('38', 415, 10, 20, 829955) A thrashing is not likely to make the doctor change his ways.
('38', 415, 10, 21, 830017) Antyaja brethren will not benefit in any way, and we will probably fail either to do justice to the doctor or win redress for the cruel ill treatment of the woman.
('38', 415, 10, 22, 830181) One who follows non violence need not feel helpless.
('38', 415, 10, 23, 830234) The path of non violence is neither for the coward nor for the stupid.

('38', 416, 1, 2, 830455) vigilant.
('38', 416, 1, 3, 830465) The law of violence concerns the body and its requirements, while the law of non violence appeals to the heart.
('38', 416, 1, 4, 830577) Through non violence we can arouse religious consciousness among the people, which means cultivating bold and true public opinion.
('38', 416, 1, 5, 830708) If the true spirit of compassion were alive in the village in which this incident occurred, such cruelty would never have been possible.
('38', 416, 1, 6, 830845) The poor doctor was only an agent.
('38', 416, 1, 7, 830880) The spirit of cruelty was in the atmosphere and that is why he had the courage to demand two rupees in advance and, though he got the money, felt afraid that he would be polluted by touching the Antyaja woman, even for treating her.
('38', 416, 1, 8, 831113) It is the duty of men who follow the path of non violence to be always vigilant and educate public opinion so as to create an atmosphere in which men like the doctor would find no encouragement for the evil in them.

('38', 416, 5, 12, 831395) A votary of non violence writes: 1
('38', 416, 6, 13, 831430) When writing the article on the cow and the buffalo, I had assumed that no clarification was called for about the matter of swaraj to the buffalo.
('38', 416, 6, 14, 831577) When we domesticate an animal, we deprive it of its freedom, however good our intention in domesticating it may be.
('38', 416, 6, 15, 831693) Hundreds of Englishmen feel happy in the belief that they rule India with a good motive and, even if we reject that rule, they think us to be fools and do not relinquish what they consider to be their duty of ruling over us.
('38', 416, 6, 16, 831918) But if a judge were appointed between us, this state ment by us would suffice: How can these self appointed protectors of ours understand our sufferings.
('38', 416, 6, 17, 832072) Only the All seeing God and we ourselves know them.
('38', 416, 6, 18, 832124) And we of course say that our good lies in being released from our bondage. Similarly, if the buffalo could speak and if an impartial judge were appointed between her and us and the buffalo entered a similar plea, and I do believe she would do sothe verdict would be in her favour.
('38', 416, 6, 19, 832406) And so I said that by giving up our fancy for rearing buffaloes, we would not be forsaking her,
('38', 416, 7, 20, 832502) 1 The letter is not translated here.
('38', 416, 7, 21, 832539) Referring to Gandhijis article Cow V. Buffalo or Cow cum Buffalo?, 8 5 1927, the correspondent had asked what Gandhiji had meant by granting swaraj to the buffalo.

('38', 417, 1, 3, 832822) There is no question in this of our disowning an accepted responsibility.
('38', 417, 1, 4, 832896) We must accept responsibility for those buffaloes which we have reared, but, if I am right in my view, no duty like that which we have accepted in regard to the cow, of adopting ways and means of increasing and improving the progeny of the cow, devolves upon us in regard to the buffalo.
('38', 417, 1, 5, 833184) Hence it is not necessary to regard the protection of the buffalo as included in our special duty of cow pro tection.
('38', 417, 1, 6, 833302) If people accept my suggestion, it will naturally be our duty to collect together all the buffaloes we have reared in regions where the cow and the bullock cannot, but only the buffalo can be maintained, and provide for the protection of her male progeny as well.
('38', 417, 1, 7, 833566) It was not my intention to suggest that there should be separate dairies and tanneries for villages, but the fact is that in the existing circumstances, it is only after making experiments in the cities that we can take to villages the science of cattle rearing, of extracting the maximum quantity of milk from the cow without torturing her, and that of tanning her hide and so on.
('38', 417, 1, 8, 833948) Such is our pitiable condition at present.
('38', 417, 1, 9, 833991) In these days, when village pasture lands have disappeared and oilcake, hay, etc., have become dear, the villagers maintain their cattle with great difficulty.
('38', 417, 1, 10, 834151) We rest content with whatever use the illiterate tanner can make of the hide.
('38', 417, 1, 11, 834229) The bones, etc., are wasted.
('38', 417, 1, 12, 834258) As a consequence, this living wealth perishes and, if the cattle do not die, they live on as skeletons, often become a burden to the owner and in the end, land in slaughter houses in Bombay and other cities.
('38', 417, 1, 13, 834466) I know that, in these circumstances, important changes need to be adopted, but I am at present unable to say how to bring them about, what methods we should adopt from the West, and so on.
('38', 417, 1, 14, 834655) This whole thing is at the moment in an experimental stage.
('38', 417, 1, 15, 834715) If I have been able to explain what needs to be done, it is for every individual worker to experiment on his own and discover how to do it.
('38', 417, 1, 16, 834855) There was a time when appropriate changes could be effected in our civilization and people accepted the need for such changes.
('38', 417, 1, 17, 834982) As long as these conditions of progress were accepted, so long, we can say, our civilization was living.
('38', 417, 1, 18, 835087) Now we believe that whatever is written in a book which is published as a Shastra and which finds its way into our hands is the Lords word and cannot be altered in any way.
('38', 417, 1, 19, 835260) We must get out of this horrible mental death.
('38', 417, 1, 20, 835307) We can see with our own eyes that there have been changes in our ways of thought and life in every age.
('38', 417, 1, 21, 835411) Accepting this truth, cultured workers should enter the villages

('38', 418, 1, 3, 835550) It is necessary for all of them to accept certain general principles; there will be differences in the methods of implementing them.
('38', 418, 1, 4, 835683) That is inevitable and should be welcomed.
('38', 418, 1, 5, 835726) From that we shall find the best ways of implementing those principles.
('38', 418, 1, 6, 835798) From this point of view, the question whether we should introduce Western machines and, if so, to what extent, becomes secondary.
('38', 418, 1, 7, 835928) The general principle is that we should produce or make whatever we can in the villages themselves, and while we can do with the indigenous razor, should not bother to introduce the German Krupp razor because it is regarded as superior.
('38', 418, 1, 8, 836165) If, however, we cannot make the sewing needle in the village, we should not set our face against the easily available and cheap needle from Austria.
('38', 418, 1, 9, 836314) I see nothing wrong in accepting from any quarter whatever is good and is worth accepting and which we can assimilate.

('38', 418, 3, 12, 836499) NANDI HILLS (MYSORE STATE), May 22, 1927
('38', 418, 4, 13, 836540) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('38', 418, 4, 14, 836573) When I say 1 the problem is not so simple as it appears to you, I mean two things.
('38', 418, 4, 15, 836656) It is not enough merely to take the name of God or believe in this thing or the other or even in this man or the other; but it is necessary ever to wait upon God and find out what His will is.
('38', 418, 4, 16, 836849) I have found this to be a most difficult, though very agreeable, task.
('38', 418, 4, 17, 836920) It is often a question, and a very delicate one, when what we may consider to be His will is really His and not ours.
('38', 418, 4, 18, 837038) Thus we come to what St. Paul has said: Work out your own salvation. The second difficulty is that all religions have more or less similar formulae, and all have produced, and continue to produce, good, true and godfearing men and women.
('38', 418, 4, 19, 837276) In the circumstances, it is not a simple matter for a humble student of all the faiths of the world to find out by prayer which is the truest religion.
('38', 418, 4, 20, 837428) But it is not difficult to say, as I do say, that all religions are more or less God given and that therefore one must work out ones own salvation in the religion of ones own forefathers; for, a

('38', 419, 6, 10, 838108) NANDI HILLS, May 22, 1927
('38', 419, 7, 11, 838134) MY DEAR BHRRR AND PROUD FATHER, I must dictate this although it is a love letter, as I better conserve my energy if I dictate stretched on my bed.
('38', 419, 7, 12, 838281) There is nothing however to be concerned about my health, as I am making steady progress though it will be some time before I regain the strength that I lost in the twinkling of an eye.
('38', 419, 7, 13, 838467) It may not be possible to regain all that I have lost; but the doctors are of opinion that much of it, it is perfectly possible to get back.
('38', 419, 7, 14, 838608) Please give my congratulations to Sohaila and Professor Muhammed Habib.
('38', 419, 7, 15, 838680) Though I cannot be with you in the body, I shall be with you in the spirit.
('38', 419, 7, 16, 838756) I wish them both a happy life of useful service to the country.
('38', 419, 7, 17, 838820) Sohaila must remember that she is not going to be married to become a mere doll and become lost to the country.
('38', 419, 7, 18, 838932) But she would be expected, like her grey headed young father, who is daily getting younger, to serve the country with the same devotion that her young father is doing; and if her husband is at all lukewarm, to touch him with her spirit and make him joint partner in such service, as he would be joint partner in all the joys and sorrows of life.
('38', 419, 7, 19, 839278) It is no use my even wishing that there should be no sorrow and all joy.
('38', 419, 7, 20, 839351) It would be a flat and dull picture without any beautiful shades.
('38', 419, 7, 21, 839417) There may be joys but they must be relieved by occasional sorrows.
('38', 419, 7, 22, 839484) So my wish and hope is that God will give them a fair measure of joys of life if He must also give them doses of sorrows to remind them that He is not to be forgotten in the midst of lifes joys.

('38', 420, 1, 2, 839722) I was wondering what you were doing and how you fared in Rangoon.
('38', 420, 1, 3, 839788) You have kept me without a letter now for a very long time.
('38', 420, 1, 4, 839848) I suppose it is all deliberate and out of considerateness for a bed ridden friend.
('38', 420, 1, 5, 839931) Raihana also has followed suit.
('38', 420, 1, 6, 839963) But you should know that neither your letter nor hers can possibly be a tax on my energy.

('38', 420, 7, 13, 840373) DEAR MISS SCHLESIN, As you know I am just now bed ridden and I must therefore dictate my reply to your letter of the 20th April just received.
('38', 420, 7, 14, 840516) It is difficult to recall what I wrote in all my letters to you.
('38', 420, 7, 15, 840581) So far as my memory serves me, there is not a single letter of yours which has gone by without an acknowledgement.
('38', 420, 7, 16, 840696) There are many compliments which I do not and cannot appropriate; but the one about my being a prompt correspondent, I can ever claim in spite of your different experience.
('38', 420, 7, 17, 840869) For, everybody else of my acquaintance has paid me the compliment of being a prompt correspondent, that is of course comparatively to many others.
('38', 420, 7, 18, 841016) I have no letter of yours dated 4th January.
('38', 420, 7, 19, 841061) But I have one dated 3rd January in my file.
('38', 420, 7, 20, 841106) I do not think that I gave you, if I did at all, a detailed reply to that letter.
('38', 420, 7, 21, 841188) It was received at the Ashram on the 3rd February.
('38', 420, 7, 22, 841239) It was then redirected to me during my tour.
('38', 420, 7, 23, 841284) Soon after, I became incapacitated.
('38', 420, 7, 24, 841320) Mr. Stanley Joness book 2 I read but only cursorily as during the tour I was able to do very little of reading.
('38', 420, 7, 25, 841432) Indeed, it was not even possible for me to look at the many books that came to me.

('38', 421, 1, 2, 841620) as it was accompanied by a letter from Mr. Stanley Jones whom I knew very well.
('38', 421, 1, 3, 841700) I do not remember his suggestion and I have not his book by me.
('38', 421, 1, 4, 841764) I quite agree with you that karma and the cross may well go together.
('38', 421, 1, 5, 841834) If you have followed the pages of Young India, you must have noticed that last year I read the New Testament every Saturday to the students of our National College.
('38', 421, 1, 6, 841999) I did stumble over the words without a cause 1, and in explaining it I simply rejected the thing as redundant.
('38', 421, 1, 7, 842110) But I was agreeably surprised on turning to Moffats and Weymouths translations which I had by me to make the discovery that you made.
('38', 421, 1, 8, 842244) In reading all religious works, I have learnt one thing.
('38', 421, 1, 9, 842301) Never to take them literally, but understand the drift and catch the drift also by means of what is to me an infallible canon of interpretation, and reject those which cannot stand the test of Truth and Ahimsa.
('38', 421, 1, 10, 842512) I know that even in spite of this canon of interpretation difficulties do arise; but they are solved if one has patience and if one has a living faith in God.
('38', 421, 1, 11, 842671) I am sending your letter to Mr. Jones as I have no doubt he will like to see your argument.
('38', 421, 1, 12, 842763) I am not likely to meet him in the near future as I shall be for some months still in the South.
('38', 421, 1, 13, 842860) Your letters should be addressed to the Ashram as usual.
('38', 421, 1, 14, 842917) The autobiography is not yet complete.
('38', 421, 1, 15, 842956) Ganesan cannot send you a copy of the autobiography.
('38', 421, 1, 16, 843009) The three parts that have been completed are in course of publication in book form.
('38', 421, 1, 17, 843093) But for the present, you have to rely upon the numbers of Young India which contain the chapters to date.
('38', 421, 1, 18, 843199) You may borrow the volumes from Manilal or you should wait till the three parts are published in book form.
('38', 421, 1, 19, 843307) You may know that before I commenced the autobiography I finished the history of the South African Passive Resistance.
('38', 421, 1, 20, 843426) The original is in Gujarati.
('38', 421, 1, 21, 843455) Its translation is now being published in instalments by Ganesan.
('38', 421, 1, 22, 843521) I am afraid it will be some time before the whole history is available in English.
('38', 421, 1, 23, 843604) Do see Mr. Sastri, Indias first Agent for South Africa.
('38', 421, 1, 24, 843660) He is an extremely fine man.
('38', 421, 1, 25, 843689) As you know he is Gokhales successor.

('38', 422, 12, 19, 844790) DEAR FRIEND, I have carefully preserved your letter of 29th January in the hope some day of being able to write to you.
('38', 422, 12, 20, 844910) It was received during my tour and I was not able to read the cuttings till during the last three days.
('38', 422, 12, 21, 845014) Lying on my sick bed I have been gradually overtaking my correspondence and I have now gone through the cuttings.
('38', 422, 12, 22, 845128) They are valuable.
('38', 422, 12, 23, 845147) In some places your translation does not do justice to the original.
('38', 422, 12, 24, 845216) But the pains you have taken to be just leads me to hope that the mistake is due to inadvertence.
('38', 423, 0, 1, 845314) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 423, 1, 2, 845356) The extracts you have collected certainly makes one sink.
('38', 423, 1, 3, 845414) I am not a critical student of religious books including the Koran.
('38', 423, 1, 4, 845482) I have read these books with sympathy and with a view to deriving religious consolation.
('38', 423, 1, 5, 845571) The effect therefore produced upon your 1 mind by the passages collected by you was naturally not produced upon my mind.
('38', 423, 1, 6, 845692) The commentary you have given upon the text, there should be no violence in religion, is quite new to me and gives a different meaning from the one which the text bears without the commentary.
('38', 423, 1, 7, 845885) I would however like to consult Mussalman friends about it.
('38', 423, 1, 8, 845945) But after all the careful thought I have given to the passages extracted by you, I adhere to the conclusion that Islam is not a religion of the sword; but it is like all other great religions a religion of peace.
('38', 423, 1, 9, 846158) I say so for this reason.
('38', 423, 1, 10, 846184) I have met numerous Mussalmans who no more think of slaying men of different faiths than you or I do.
('38', 423, 1, 11, 846286) And these Mussalmans are by no means scoffers.
('38', 423, 1, 12, 846333) They are devout followers of their faith.
('38', 423, 1, 13, 846375) The long line of Sufis whose veneration for the Koran cannot be questioned owe their illuminating philosophy of peace and love to the Koran.
('38', 423, 1, 14, 846516) I have read Maulana Shiblis Life of the Prophet as also portions of his Al Kalam.
('38', 423, 1, 15, 846598) I have read also his Leaves from the Lives of the Companions of the Prophet.
('38', 423, 1, 16, 846675) The sum total of the impression left on my mind by these writings is of an elevating character.
('38', 423, 1, 17, 846771) I hope you do not wish to suggest that Maulana Shibli and such other writers on Islam have written what they did not believe and in order to throw dust in the eyes of others.
('38', 423, 1, 18, 846946) All this does not however mean that I regard the life of the Prophet to have been perfect or that the Koran itself is a perfect book.
('38', 423, 1, 19, 847080) Like all other religious books including our own, there are passages which cause difficulty.
('38', 423, 1, 20, 847173) But the difficulties caused in reading the Koran are not greater than those caused by reading books of other faiths.
('38', 423, 1, 21, 847290) Christianity, I surmise, admittedly is a religion of peace; but the Old Testament which is part of Christian teaching is full of blood and thunder, and the history of early Christianity is also by no means creditable to the Christians.
('38', 423, 1, 22, 847526) You ask me to quote from the Vedas passages alike to those in the Koran.
('38', 423, 1, 23, 847599) You have yourself admitted the reference to the dasyus.
('38', 423, 1, 24, 847655) The gloss you put upon the passages relating to dasyus may be quite all right; but that is precisely how sympathetic commentators of the Koran explain similar passages.
('38', 423, 1, 25, 847824) Dasyus do not consider themselves to be wicked.
('38', 423, 2, 26, 847872) 1 The source has my.
('38', 424, 0, 1, 847893) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 425
('38', 424, 1, 2, 847936) Everybody justifies his description of practices by imputing wickedness to those whom he distrusts.
('38', 424, 1, 3, 848036) General Dyer himself surely believed that English men and women were in danger of losing their lives if he did not take the measures he did.
('38', 424, 1, 4, 848177) We who know better call it an act of cruelty and vengeance.
('38', 424, 1, 5, 848237) But from General Dyers own standpoint, he is justified.
('38', 424, 1, 6, 848293) Many Hindus sincerely believe that it is a proper thing to kill a man who wants to kill a cow 1 and he will quote scripture for his defence and many other Hindus will be found to justify his action.
('38', 424, 1, 7, 848492) But strangers who do not accept the sacredness of the cow will hold it to be preposterous to kill a human being for the sake of slaying an animal.
('38', 424, 1, 8, 848639) Guru Nanak 2 who undoubtedly read the Koran and is reported even to have gone to Mecca, returned with lofty regard for Islam.
('38', 424, 1, 9, 848765) Kabir 3 did likewise.
('38', 424, 1, 10, 848787) So did Dadu.
('38', 424, 1, 11, 848800) I cannot therefore help thinking that it is a fruitless and undesirable effort to show that the Koran is a wicked book and that followers of the Koran are still more so.
('38', 424, 1, 12, 848970) I suggest that the better method is to find out the good points and the beauties of these writings which have transformed the lives of those who have believed in them.
('38', 424, 1, 13, 849138) It is unsafe and even dangerous to judge Islam and Mussalmans by the conduct of many of those who are misrepresented here in India and then to seek to ascribe their conduct to the teachings of the Koran.
('38', 424, 1, 14, 849342) In order to defend the general trend of the Koran in favour of peace I am not required to disprove any atrocity by a single Mussalman or to explain away the few misdeeds that I see going on before me, But my liberal estimate of the Koran thus enables me to extend to the Mussalmans the justice that I would have extended to fellow Hindus.
('38', 424, 1, 15, 849681) It is an easier task to sympathize with the different religions of the world than to pick up one and seek to prove it as the only true religion and then set about demolishing all the rest.
('38', 424, 1, 16, 849870) I have entered into a long reply to your letter because I believe you to be a seeker after Truth.
('38', 424, 1, 17, 849968) If you want any further explanation from me, I shall gladly give it.
('38', 424, 2, 18, 850037) Yours sincerely,

('38', 425, 3, 4, 850420) NARMADA, I had replied to your letter but I had sent it to your school address because I did not know your full name and address.
('38', 425, 3, 5, 850550) You must have received that letter.
('38', 425, 3, 6, 850586) I did not know you were to be married so soon.
('38', 425, 3, 7, 850633) I hope you would continue your studies and that you would not give up the noble patriotic feelings that you had expressed to me and also conveyed through your letter and that your husband would let you cherish them.

('38', 425, 8, 14, 851107) And for the most part for the present I propose not to write more than once per week.
('38', 425, 8, 15, 851193) I want to conserve my energy for the work for Young India, Navajivan and Gita.
('38', 425, 8, 16, 851272) I am doing now at least five times as much as I used to on the Gita.
('38', 425, 8, 17, 851341) I want if possible to finish the translation before the end of August.
('38', 425, 8, 18, 851412) And during this rest I would like to give more attention to Young India and Navajivan without feeling in any way responsible for filling the columns.
('38', 425, 8, 19, 851562) But of course I shall write oftener if necessary or if you again have those moods returning.
('38', 425, 8, 20, 851655) But you will not now.
('38', 425, 8, 21, 851677) I am so glad you resisted the bhang.
('38', 425, 8, 22, 851714) It is as bad almost as liquor.
('38', 425, 8, 23, 851745) In any case you will remember what I wrote 2 over the betel leaf offered by Hakimjinever to eat a single thing without knowing it and its quality.

('38', 426, 1, 4, 852139) Unfortunately many religi ously minded people take for feeling exalted.
('38', 426, 1, 5, 852211) The exaltation is all false I know.
('38', 426, 1, 6, 852247) However, you have done your duty by mentioning the thing to him.
('38', 426, 1, 7, 852312) The things must take their own course now.
('38', 426, 1, 8, 852355) Jamnalalji showed me your Hindi letter to him.
('38', 426, 1, 9, 852402) It was quite good.
('38', 426, 1, 10, 852421) The writing was very good.
('38', 426, 1, 11, 852448) J. leaves for Bombay tomorrow.

('38', 426, 1, 14, 852617) Today is the fifth day.
('38', 426, 1, 15, 852641) Nothing untoward so far.

('38', 426, 7, 23, 852937) I regard it as a great step forward.
('38', 426, 7, 24, 852974) Now stick diligently to the work.
('38', 426, 7, 25, 853008) God will help you to succeed.
('38', 426, 7, 26, 853038) There are plenty of other such duties that you can undertake by which you can bring credit to the Ashram.
('38', 426, 7, 27, 853144) But I am in no hurry about it.
('38', 426, 7, 28, 853175) Since your minds are pure, you will gradually take up many new duties of your own accord.
('38', 426, 7, 29, 853265) Concentrate for the present upon making the management of the store a complete success.
('38', 426, 7, 30, 853353) Do not neglect even the smallest detail connected with it.
('38', 426, 7, 31, 853412) You must of course learn how to keep accounts.
('38', 426, 7, 32, 853459) Do not imagine that it is difficult.
('38', 426, 7, 33, 853496) It is very easy to keep and understand accounts.
('38', 426, 7, 34, 853545) Addition may be difficult.
('38', 426, 7, 35, 853572) If one does not know the multiplication tables or addition, one would certainly experience some difficulty.
('38', 426, 7, 36, 853680) But addition comes with practice.
('38', 426, 7, 37, 853714) Learn addition, subtraction, multiplication and simple division, whichever it is that you do not know.

('38', 427, 5, 7, 854185) The idea seems extremely beautiful to me.
('38', 427, 5, 8, 854227) A perfect brahmachari must be perfectly pure.
('38', 427, 5, 9, 854273) Who else but God can be so?
('38', 427, 5, 10, 854301) But we must try to become pure like Him.
('38', 427, 5, 11, 854342) All Shastras proclaim that that is possible.
('38', 427, 5, 12, 854387) There is nothing but joy in trying to become like Him.
('38', 427, 5, 13, 854442) It is my experience that we do not get even one ten millionth part of that joy from the things of this world which are supposed to give us pleasure.

('38', 427, 8, 21, 854993) But what even if it had?
('38', 427, 8, 22, 855018) If at all, such a lump of earth will hurt only the body.
('38', 427, 8, 23, 855075) The body is like a glass bangle.
('38', 427, 8, 24, 855108) The glass bangle which is the human body is of no account whatever in the eternity of Brahman, as life of a glass bangle is of none in comparison with the human life span of a hundred years.
('38', 427, 8, 25, 855299) What does it matter if it perishes today or tomorrow, or if it develops a crack?

('38', 427, 8, 27, 855482) Such a person would never do wrong.
('38', 427, 8, 28, 855518) He would oppress no one.

('38', 428, 5, 9, 855970) It is well written indeed, but you will see that I have written no word about Surat and Baroda in Navajivan.
('38', 428, 5, 10, 856079) There was a purpose in this.
('38', 428, 5, 11, 856108) If I were to say that mischievous elements deliberately indulge in hooliganism that would have on them the opposite effect [to that intended].
('38', 428, 5, 12, 856251) I even go to the extent of believing that if the newspapers write nothing about the disturbances, they will subside by themselves.
('38', 428, 5, 13, 856382) But not all news papermen want it, so it will not come to be.
('38', 428, 5, 14, 856444) But let those of us who know remain silent.
('38', 428, 5, 15, 856488) Let those who want to fight do it.
('38', 428, 5, 16, 856523) If we happen to be present there and feel like sacrificing ourselves and if we have the strength let us do it.
('38', 428, 5, 17, 856634) Thats enough.
('38', 428, 5, 18, 856648) And if we can sacrifice ourselves with a detached mind, let us be confident that its result will definitely be good.

('38', 429, 6, 9, 857488) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I had your letter whilst I was on the sick list and unable to do much correspondence.
('38', 429, 6, 10, 857594) I am still convalescing and am able to do only a moderate amount of work; but I am making steady progress.
('38', 429, 6, 11, 857701) You have been there a long time now; but I know you have not wasted it.
('38', 429, 6, 12, 857773) I hope however that Kamala will become completely restored when you return.
('38', 429, 6, 13, 857849) If her health requires a longer stay, I presume that you will remain there.
('38', 429, 6, 14, 857925) I read most carefully your public report as also your private confidential report about the doings of the Oppressed Nations Conference.
('38', 429, 6, 15, 858061) I myself do not expect much from this league, if only because its free activity depends upon the goodwill of the powers that are partners in the exploitation of the oppressed nations and I feel that the members of the European nations that joined the league will not be able to sustain the last heat.
('38', 429, 6, 16, 858362) For, they will not be able to accom modate themselves to what they would consider to be an injury to their self interest.
('38', 429, 6, 17, 858484) On our side there is danger of our people again looking to external forces and external aid for salvation instead of seeking to achieve it by evolving internal strength.
('38', 429, 6, 18, 858654) But this is mere academic opinion.
('38', 429, 6, 19, 858689) I am not at all carefully following European events.
('38', 429, 6, 20, 858742) You are on the spot and you may see an altruistic improve ment in the atmosphere there which I miss altogether.
('38', 429, 7, 21, 858854) 1 In a letter to Chhaganlal Gandhi, Gandhiji advised him to say this at prayer time every day.

('38', 430, 1, 2, 858992) There is some talk of your being chosen as President for the coming Congress.
('38', 430, 1, 3, 859070) I am in correspondence with Father about it.
('38', 430, 1, 4, 859115) 1 The outlook here is not at all happy in spite of the unanimous resolution of the A.I.C.C. on the Hindu Muslim question.
('38', 430, 1, 5, 859237) I do not know whether the process of breaking heads will in any way be checked.
('38', 430, 1, 6, 859317) We have lost hold upon the masses, and it seems to me that if you became President, you will be lost for one year at any rate to the masses.
('38', 430, 1, 7, 859458) That, however, does not mean that Congress work has to be neglected.
('38', 430, 1, 8, 859527) Someone has got to do it; but there are many who are willing and eager to do that work, maybe, due to mixed motives, even selfish motives; but they will keep the Congress going on somehow or other.
('38', 430, 1, 9, 859725) The institution will always be, at their wish, at the disposal of those who may be qualified for mass work and may have gained control over the masses.
('38', 430, 1, 10, 859877) The question then is how your services can be best utilized.
('38', 430, 1, 11, 859938) What you yourself think, you should do.
('38', 430, 1, 12, 859978) I know you are capable of taking a detached view and you will say quite unselfishly like Dadabhai or MacSwiney put the crown on my head, and I have no doubt that it will be so put.
('38', 430, 1, 13, 860159) I do not myself see the way so clear as to make me force the crown on you and plead with you to wear it.
('38', 430, 1, 14, 860264) Father will be writing to you also by this mail, if he has not done so already.
('38', 430, 1, 15, 860344) I am sending a copy of this to him.
('38', 430, 1, 16, 860380) It might be as well for you to cable your wishes.
('38', 430, 1, 17, 860430) I am likely to be in Bangalore till the end of July.
('38', 430, 1, 18, 860483) You may therefore send your cable directly to Bangalore, or to be absolutely certain send it to the Ashram and it will be repeated to me wherever I may be.

('38', 431, 1, 5, 861164) He had not thought of it.
('38', 431, 1, 6, 861190) He, however, preferred Ansari and I told him that if Dr. Ansari could be induced to accept the honour, there was an end to all talk about Jawaharlal and that I thought it would be good luck if Dr. Ansari could be induced to shoulder the burden.
('38', 431, 1, 7, 861435) However, I have written to Jawaharlal and I send you a copy of my letter 1 to him.
('38', 431, 1, 8, 861518) It expresses my opinion to date.
('38', 431, 1, 9, 861551) At first I thought I would let you send my letter so that you could stop it if you liked; but I then thought that after all there was no harm in my letter going to Jawaharlal before you had seen it.
('38', 431, 1, 10, 861750) You could add whatever you liked to my letter so as to enable Jawaharlal to form a correct judgement.

('38', 431, 6, 15, 861950) DEAR MR. CLAYTON, I am extremely grateful to you for your prompt and exhaustive reply to my letter of the 13th instant.
('38', 431, 6, 16, 862070) I have carefully gone through the cutting from the Municipal Corporation Proceedings of 1918; but I see nothing wrong there to warrant the suggestion that I made any inquiry or that I made any report to the late Dr. Turner.
('38', 431, 6, 17, 862294) As I was interested in everything connected with untouchability and as I was closely in touch with the Servants of India Society, so far as I recollect, I went with Mr. Thakkar at his instance to see the chawls and see the unfortunate people.
('38', 431, 6, 18, 862537) On hearing that I had gone, Dr. Turner sent me a message and I gladly met him and told him what I had been doing in the chawls.
('38', 431, 6, 19, 862665) You will not call this an inquiry by me or a report.
('38', 431, 6, 20, 862718) If I had conducted an inquiry, it would have naturally taken a proper shape, I would have taken the evidence of men in writing, I would have seen the officials who were charged with corruption and made a proper written report.
('38', 431, 6, 21, 862945) As it was, I happened to be in Bombay at the time in the course of my touring and Mr. Thakkar took me to the chawls as other people took me to many other places.
('38', 431, 6, 22, 863107) I do not think that this

('38', 432, 1, 2, 863202) visit of mine and my conversation with Dr. Turner should for ever be used to damage Mr. Thakkars reputation as a careful investigator.
('38', 432, 1, 3, 863337) However, I want to turn this account to a useful purpose.
('38', 432, 1, 4, 863395) I do not propose at this stage to say anything in the papers.
('38', 432, 1, 5, 863457) But I am in correspondence with Mr. Thakkar.
('38', 432, 1, 6, 863502) I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of your letter to him making suggestions to him so that this matter of alleged corruption might be once for all set at rest.
('38', 432, 2, 7, 863669) I quite agree with you that there should be no unfounded accusations made against anything or person and no general accu sations made against the Corporation staff without adequate evidence to support them.
('38', 432, 2, 8, 863876) With your permission, after finishing the corres pondence with Mr. Thakkar, I hope to revert to the subject matter of my letter.
('38', 432, 2, 9, 864005) Thanking you for your enquiry about myself.
('38', 432, 2, 10, 864049) I am making fair progress and I shall certainly be delighted when I next pass through Bombay to meet you to revive the pleasant recollections of our meeting in Godhra.
('38', 432, 3, 11, 864217) Yours sincerely,

('38', 432, 7, 15, 864341) BHAI TOTARAM, I have your letter.
('38', 432, 7, 16, 864375) Now I understand the true nature of Gangadevis disease.
('38', 432, 7, 17, 864431) Other things may well continue but she must be taken out.
('38', 432, 7, 18, 864489) She cannot walk by herself.
('38', 432, 7, 19, 864517) Therefore, either some boys should take her out in a chair for half an hour in the open air or even a wheel chair may be used.
('38', 432, 7, 20, 864644) The wheel chair can be managed by one or two boys only.
('38', 432, 7, 21, 864700) She can also lie down in it.
('38', 432, 7, 22, 864729) Rest is imperative but so is open air.
('38', 432, 7, 23, 864768) You should not hesitate to arrange for this.
('38', 432, 7, 24, 864813) Ba seldom writes to anyone nor am I in the habit of mentioning her in my letters.
('38', 432, 7, 25, 864895) Nevertheless she always remembers everyone.
('38', 432, 8, 26, 864939) Gangadevi should take it that my blessings always include Bas.
('38', 432, 9, 27, 865002) I am very pleased by the fortitude shown by both of you and I know it is an example for all of us.
('38', 432, 9, 28, 865101) May God grant you peace, as ever.

('38', 433, 2, 3, 865201) Blessings from

('38', 433, 5, 5, 865257) 439. HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY
('38', 433, 6, 6, 865284) I wish it was possible for me to tender the Government of Bengal congratulations upon the release of Sjt.
('38', 433, 6, 7, 865390) Subhas Chandra Bose.
('38', 433, 6, 8, 865411) The release has been granted, not because public opinion demanded it, not because Government considered the Chief Officer of the Calcutta Corporation to be guiltless, nor because they considered that he had been sufficiently punished for a crime of which neither he nor the public has any knowledge, but because their own medical officers considered the distinguished prisoner to be seriously ill, so seriously ill as to cause fear about his life.
('38', 433, 6, 9, 865859) If Sjt.
('38', 433, 6, 10, 865867) Subhas Chandra Bose is a danger to society or to the life of anybody, and if he is a man of determination as he is reputed to be and even believed by the Government to be, he is no less dangerous because he is seriously ill.
('38', 433, 6, 11, 866092) Why should the Government be afraid of his dying in their prison?
('38', 433, 6, 12, 866158) Surely it is not customary with them to release every prisoner who becomes dangerously ill.
('38', 433, 6, 13, 866250) And if it was right to discharge him for his illness, why was he not discharged when he first showed signs of tuberculosis?
('38', 433, 6, 14, 866374) Papers have been for a long time full of information about the alarming character of his disease.
('38', 433, 6, 15, 866472) His brother repeatedly warned the Government about the prisoners illness.
('38', 433, 6, 16, 866546) It is, I venture to suggest cowardly to fling a dying man in the face of his relatives and wash oneself of the guilt of his death.
('38', 433, 6, 17, 866677) This release brings us no nearer to the solution of the question of imprisonment or indefinite detention, without trial, of prisoners whom Government choose to suspect.
('38', 433, 6, 18, 866846) The Bengal Regulation remains where it was.
('38', 433, 6, 19, 866890) More or less healthy detenus must continue to rot, and are now deprived of the support of an agitation which was kept at a fairly high pitch because a powerful man was under detention.
('38', 433, 6, 20, 867075) No doubt some sort of agitation will still continue for the release of the other detenus.
('38', 433, 6, 21, 867165) But there is every fear of its lacking strength.
('38', 433, 6, 22, 867214) Indian nature is grateful for the smallest mercies.
('38', 433, 6, 23, 867266) It is easily satisfied.
('38', 433, 6, 24, 867290) And the public will condone the detention of the other prisoners for the release of Sjt.
('38', 433, 6, 25, 867379) Subhas Chandra Bose, forgetting that the release is due not to any
('38', 434, 0, 1, 867446) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 435
('38', 434, 1, 2, 867489) relenting on the part of the Government but due to Natures supreme intervention.
('38', 434, 1, 3, 867570) It may seem cruel, but I must confess that I would far rather not have any release at all than have a release on false issues, which merely complicate the main issue and make it more difficult to deal with than before; for behind the agitation for the release of the detenus is the great question of the liberty of the citizens and the question of extraordinary powers exercised over the lives of people by an utterly irresponsible Government.
('38', 434, 1, 4, 868014) The one consolation that the public can derive from this painful affair is, that Sjt.
('38', 434, 1, 5, 868100) Subhas Chandra Bose up to the very last moment manfully declined to accept the humiliating conditions from time to time proposed by the Government for his discharge.
('38', 434, 1, 6, 868266) Let us hope and pray that he will be soon restored to health and that a long life of service will be vouchsafed to him.

('38', 434, 4, 9, 868443) In another place will be found a substance of the observations made in the columns of Navajivan by Sjt.
('38', 434, 4, 10, 868547) Kishorelal Mashruwala.
('38', 434, 4, 11, 868570) He is a worker of long standing and was up to recently Registrar of the Gujarat Vidyapith, and it was only due to illness that he was obliged to relinquish the post.
('38', 434, 4, 12, 868736) He is one of the most thoughtful among the silent workers we have in India.
('38', 434, 4, 13, 868812) He weighs every word he writes or utters.
('38', 434, 4, 14, 868854) I mention these qualifications of his; for I am anxious that his reflections should not be dismissed out of consideration as so many writings nowadays have to be.
('38', 434, 4, 15, 869017) The story of the abuse of the helpless women of the Raniparaj community is a blot upon the nation.
('38', 434, 4, 16, 869116) Kishorelal Mashruwala has made his appeal to the Parsis, and from his standpoint, rightly too.
('38', 434, 4, 17, 869211) For it is the Parsis who will be better able, if anyone is, to influence the Parsi men who are said to be corrupting innocent womanhood.
('38', 434, 4, 18, 869348) But I am painfully aware of the fact that it is not the Parsis alone who hold so cheap the honour of poor sisters.
('38', 434, 4, 19, 869463) Indians belonging to the other faiths, placed in similar circumstances, have been known to behave exactly as the Parsi canteen keepers are reported to be doing.
('38', 434, 4, 20, 869624) But that is no justification whatsoever for the inhuman crimes of the latter.
('38', 434, 4, 21, 869702) The lust for money, which drives these adventurers to a trade which they know saps the manhood of the otherwise fine forest dwellers miscalled
('38', 435, 0, 1, 869845) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 435, 1, 2, 869887) Kaliparaj, i.e., black people, tempts them to the worse crime of defilement.
('38', 435, 1, 3, 869964) The British Government or rather the Government of India and the Baroda State must be held primarily responsible for the tragedy described by Sjt.
('38', 435, 1, 4, 870111) Mashruwala; for it is they, who for their wretched revenue allow liquor shops to be opened or to exist in the midst of these simple people.
('38', 435, 1, 5, 870251) These people have never asked for these shops, and even if they had, it would be still criminal to open liquor shops for them, even as it would be to allow a little child to play with fire because he desires it.
('38', 435, 1, 6, 870463) But a reformer does not stop before commencing action to philosophize or to distribute blame through golden scales.
('38', 435, 1, 7, 870579) He begins his reform wherever the opportunity offers itself.
('38', 435, 1, 8, 870640) And now that the corruption has been brought to light, it behoves Parsi reformers to go to the delinquents and appeal to their sense of honour and try to wean them from the crime of violating the womanhood of the simple, innocent and guileless Raniparaj, even if they cannot also be weaned from trafficking in liquor.
('38', 435, 1, 9, 870958) Unfortunately, there is much truth in the taunt levelled at us as a nation, that we have not sufficient regard for the honour of our women.
('38', 435, 1, 10, 871098) It is no use false patriotism seeking cover under tu quoque argument; nor must we mix up sexual immorality, in which depraved men and women of equal status indulge of their own free but unbridled will, with the instances of crime quoted by Sjt.
('38', 435, 1, 11, 871343) Kishorelal Mashruwala.
('38', 435, 1, 12, 871366) Immoralities of the first kind are bad enough and do incredible harm to mankind; but the crimes like those of the Parsi canteen kee pers are infinitely worse and have not yet, thank God, received the tacit endorsement of fashionable society.
('38', 435, 1, 13, 871608) In the instances quoted by Sjt.
('38', 435, 1, 14, 871640) Kishorelal Mashruwala, the canteen keepers are in the position of trustees, and it is insufferable that they should induce ignorant women in whose midst they are living to become instruments of their criminal lust.
('38', 435, 1, 15, 871855) It is this kind of indifference to the honour of ignorant sisters who come under the influence or protection of the so called better class men, which has been justifiably criticized, and which we must, if we want to become a self respecting and independent nation, outgrow at any cost.
('38', 435, 1, 16, 872141) The honour of the least among our sisters must be as dear to us as that of our blood sisters.

('38', 436, 2, 3, 872312) ALL INDIA SPINNERS ASSOCIATION
('38', 436, 3, 4, 872343) The Council of the All India Spinners Association has, owing to the necessity of prolonged rest that I must take from active and routine work, relieved me of the burden of directing the affairs of the Association and appointed Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj as officiating Chairman.
('38', 436, 3, 5, 872616) Whilst, therefore, I still nominally remain President of the Association, the whole burden of directing its affairs will now fall upon Jamnalalji, and correspondents will henceforth, whenever they find it necessary, write to him rather than to me.
('38', 436, 3, 6, 872864) The proper course certainly is to write to the working Secretary Sjt.
('38', 436, 3, 7, 872934) Shankerlal Banker to whom naturally Jamnalalji will have to refer all correspondence before coming to any decision.
('38', 436, 3, 8, 873050) This does not mean that I shall take no interest in the affairs of the Association.
('38', 436, 3, 9, 873134) On the contrary, whenever in the opinion of the Council or the officiating Chairman or the Secretary, any matter should be referred to me, it will come before me for guidance and advice.
('38', 436, 3, 10, 873321) But the Councils decision and the arrangements I have come to with it are that I should not worry myself as hitherto over details and over every individual matter trifling or otherwise.
('38', 436, 3, 11, 873507) They have taken an undertaking from me to refrain from doing so and to throw the burden on them and leave it for them to refer to me matters which they may consider to be important enough for referring to me.
('38', 436, 3, 12, 873716) The test of a living organization is that it depends upon no single individual, however important, however able he may be.
('38', 436, 3, 13, 873839) A living organization goes on irrespective of persons.
('38', 436, 3, 14, 873894) The endeavour of the members of the Council is to make the Association a living and efficiently working organization.
('38', 436, 3, 15, 874012) I trust, therefore, that khadi workers and khadi lovers will fall in with the new arrangement and render all the help they can to the Council in working this growing organization to the fullest extent possible.
('38', 436, 4, 16, 874223) AN EXAMPLE TO COPY
('38', 436, 5, 17, 874242) The State of Jaora seems to be noted for its dyeing and printing.
('38', 436, 5, 18, 874308) I understand that His Highness the Nawab Saheb is interested in the khadi movement and, in order to make khadi more attractive by putting it through the dyeing and printing processes and thus to encourage it, he has exempted khadi from any tax.
('38', 436, 5, 19, 874553) I congratulate the State on this praiseworthy step, and hope that other States will grant favoured treatment to this great and growing national enterprise which
('38', 437, 0, 1, 874714) 438 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI

('38', 437, 2, 3, 874826) VIVEKANANDA AND SPINNING
('38', 437, 3, 4, 874851) A correspondent sends me interesting extracts from Viveka nandas answers to his American questioners.
('38', 437, 3, 5, 874953) I take the following from them on spinning:
('38', 437, 4, 6, 874997) Speaking of Indian village life he says: In some places the common

('38', 437, 6, 8, 875214) these machines and sciences?
('38', 437, 6, 9, 875243) They have only one result; they spread
('38', 437, 7, 10, 875282) knowledge.
('38', 437, 7, 11, 875293) You have not solved the problem of want, but only made it keener.
('38', 437, 8, 12, 875359) Machines do not solve the poverty problem; they simply make men struggle
('38', 437, 9, 13, 875432) the more.
('38', 437, 9, 14, 875442) Competition gets keener....
('38', 437, 9, 15, 875470) The value of everything is to be decided
('38', 437, 10, 16, 875511) by how far it is a manifestation of God.

('38', 437, 13, 20, 875627) May 26, 1927
('38', 437, 14, 21, 875640) DEAR SATIS BABU,
('38', 437, 15, 22, 875657) I have your letter and I have one from Kshitish Babu also.
('38', 437, 15, 23, 875716) You already have seen my note 1 in Young India.
('38', 437, 15, 24, 875764) I had assumed when Jamnalalji who was here told me that I should write a paragraph in Young India about the new arrangement that all the members of the Council had agreed to it.
('38', 437, 15, 25, 875942) The original idea was to have my resignation in its entirety.
('38', 437, 15, 26, 876004) The resolution already passed adopts the middle course.
('38', 437, 15, 27, 876060) I thought that my ceasing to be the President of the Association would be too hasty and might damage the cause, and it was not warranted by anything in my health.
('38', 437, 15, 28, 876223) But I thought that it was quite a good idea to relieve me of the responsibility of routine work and let the Council evolve independently of me, whilst my advice and guidance were available wherever necessary.
('38', 437, 15, 29, 876432) Personally, I think that the tour had nothing to do with the collapse.
('38', 437, 15, 30, 876503) It was the very exacting nature of the work that I myself voluntarily undertook.
('38', 437, 15, 31, 876584) No one pressed me to go through the hurri

('38', 438, 1, 2, 876732) cane touring.
('38', 438, 1, 3, 876746) I let the co workers think and thought myself that my constitution would somehow or other stand the pressure that was put upon it, and do you know that the collapse came upon the very last day of this severe trial?
('38', 438, 1, 4, 876961) For, I had intended to turn over a new leaf after finishing the Maharashtra tour and had given due notice 1 to Rajagopalachariar that I would no longer be hurried and was looking forward to finishing the rest of the tours during the year in easy stages.
('38', 438, 1, 5, 877215) If the collapse had not occurred, I would have thought in my pride that I could tax my constitution to any extent.
('38', 438, 1, 6, 877330) Nature took her vengeance and she did it so gently that, as Dr. Wanless put it, it was Natures first fairly severe warning.
('38', 438, 1, 7, 877454) He thinks, many other doctors think and I think also that, if I regain, as I think it is possible to do, a fair measure of the strength I lost in the twinkling of an eye, I should be able to do a moderate amount of touring.
('38', 438, 1, 8, 877678) Doctors even think that it might do good, though the condition is imperative that there must be daily rest; no hurry; no bustle; no working to time and order; only one meeting per day, and not much speaking even then and so on.
('38', 438, 1, 9, 877906) I am trying to adjust my mind to this new mode of life.
('38', 438, 1, 10, 877962) If I succeed, it may be possible to prolong the life and still do a moderate amount of work.
('38', 438, 1, 11, 878055) Please, therefore, do not worry about what has happened.
('38', 438, 1, 12, 878112) Later on, I may even resume the routine work.
('38', 438, 1, 13, 878158) You should regularly give me a weekly letter and tell me how you and all the others are faring.
('38', 438, 1, 14, 878254) As for myself, I am making steady progress daily.
('38', 438, 1, 15, 878304) In a months time, I might be able to do a little of gentle touring in Madras Presidency in order to take charge of the purses already collected.
('38', 438, 2, 16, 878449) With love, Yours sincerely,

('38', 439, 4, 5, 878698) DEAR MISS HOWARD,
('38', 439, 5, 6, 878716) I was delighted to receive your letter giving me details about the late Mr. Howard and yourself.
('38', 439, 5, 7, 878813) Of your connection with him and your selfless devotion, I knew nothing.
('38', 439, 5, 8, 878885) It does ones soul good to read the account you have sent me, for which I am most grateful to you.
('38', 439, 5, 9, 878983) I hope you are now getting your Young India regularly; if not, you will please let me know.
('38', 439, 5, 10, 879075) Do please write to me from time to time.
('38', 439, 5, 11, 879116) I am obliged to dictate this letter as I am just now on the sick list.
('38', 439, 5, 12, 879187) With loving regards from Mrs. Gandhi and myself,

('38', 440, 3, 4, 879479) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter now after a long time.
('38', 440, 3, 5, 879537) I always think of you.
('38', 440, 3, 6, 879560) You need not be anxious about my health.
('38', 440, 3, 7, 879601) I am making steady progress.
('38', 440, 3, 8, 879630) The collapse, though it was temporary, left me very weak.
('38', 440, 3, 9, 879688) I am however able to attend to a moderate amount of work daily.
('38', 440, 3, 10, 879752) I shall look forward to your account of your meeting with Mr. Ranchhodlal Amritlal.
('38', 440, 3, 11, 879836) I note what you say about the two publications.
('38', 440, 3, 12, 879884) We should not however mind them.
('38', 440, 3, 13, 879917) We cannot prevent people from holding what views they like.
('38', 440, 3, 14, 879977) We have to respect other peoples opinions even though they may not be to our liking even as we expect them to respect ours.
('38', 440, 4, 15, 880101) Yours, sincerely, MRS.

('38', 440, 7, 19, 880249) NANDI HILLS, May 26, 1927 MY DEAR SRI PRAKASA, I was delighted to receive your letter redirected to me from the Ashram.
('38', 440, 7, 20, 880369) Your yarn is passable, and you should enlist yourself as a member of the Spinners Association without any misgivings.
('38', 440, 7, 21, 880487) In the hot days, I can understand the takli giving you trouble.
('38', 440, 7, 22, 880551) It would then be best to do it at dawn when you can see the thread clearly without artificial light at all.
('38', 440, 7, 23, 880659) At that time there is even in thedriest climate a certain humidity which makes the slivers more workable.
('38', 440, 7, 24, 880765) And, at the time of doing the takli, if you are doing it in quiet, you can recite all your Bhagavad Gita or any other favourite

('38', 441, 4, 8, 881261) 446. LETTER TO R. B. GREGG
('38', 441, 5, 9, 881288) NANDI HILLS, May 27, 1927
('38', 441, 6, 10, 881314) MY DEAR GOVIND, The occasion for writing this letter is supplied by your capital letter of the 17th instant to Maganlal of which he has sent me a copy.
('38', 441, 6, 11, 881466) Your suggestions are all perfect, if the premises can be accepted by us.
('38', 441, 6, 12, 881539) Probably Maganlal has not even thought of what I am about to tell you; though I shouldnt be surprised if he has also thought of the same thing, for I think that he has assimilated the inwardness of the spinning movement.
('38', 441, 6, 13, 881760) What I want to state is this: the movement is bound to fail if we expect to succeed by adopting the same methods, or very nearly the same methods with necessary adaptations, as the adversary, if such a term can be properly used under a plan of life which admits of no enemies.
('38', 441, 6, 14, 882037) In my opinion, we have to devise other ways of making the movement a living and universal force at least so far as India is concerned.
('38', 441, 6, 15, 882172) The adversary believes in the latest appliances and therefore is bound to adopt the methods of those who are adepts in using those appliances; but in the spinning movement, modern appliances are largely discarded and the few that are retained are used in a different way.
('38', 441, 6, 16, 882444) Typewriters, shorthand assistance and the like are taken in our movement as a temporary measure.
('38', 441, 6, 17, 882541) Immediately one goes to the villages, these become a hindrance rather than a help.
('38', 441, 6, 18, 882624) If the movement has to depend upon first class stenography, it will fail before long.
('38', 441, 6, 19, 882710) For, it cannot make any headway under those conditions beyond the cities.
('38', 441, 6, 20, 882784) It cannot succeed even if it has to depend upon the English language for its spread.
('38', 441, 6, 21, 882869) And so you find that at the Ashram, in the Association office and even here we are managing with most
('38', 442, 0, 1, 882971) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 443
('38', 442, 1, 2, 883014) indifferent stenography.
('38', 442, 1, 3, 883039) Even if we advertised, we shall probably not get the best stenographer, because he will know that there is room only for half a dozen stenographers in the movement, and then we shall have to pay not 100 or 125, which is the most I think that is being paid, but we should have to pay anything between 200 and 400 for getting the assistance such as you have in mind.
('38', 442, 1, 4, 883404) I should quite agree with you if you argue that even that salary would be economy even if only one man has to be obtained.
('38', 442, 1, 5, 883527) Experience, however, shows that it is not possible to retain the services of such a man unless you are prepared to allow him to become the master and to dictate his own terms in every respect.
('38', 442, 1, 6, 883720) Thus it would be useless to have an able stenographer who has no faith in the movement, who would disdain to wear khadi and who would require polished furniture before he will settle down to work.
('38', 442, 1, 7, 883917) The spinning movement, so far as I can see, will never afford the high wages that are demanded by good men in such a line of business.
('38', 442, 1, 8, 884052) Do you know that if in khadi service we offer high wages even to one man, there is immediately and naturally a ferment throughout the rank and file and they would all begin to compare their low wages to the high wages given even to one single man?
('38', 442, 1, 9, 884300) The proper working of the spinning movement is still being evolved.
('38', 442, 1, 10, 884368) It is in a state of flux, and it will be some time before it can be said to be stabilized.
('38', 442, 1, 11, 884459) It is a movement which has to grow from within.
('38', 442, 1, 12, 884507) It is a movement which requires a fair measure of continuous sacrifice from those who have become accustomed to city life.
('38', 442, 1, 13, 884630) The class of men and women required for the movement have got to be trained and brought up.
('38', 442, 1, 14, 884722) They cannot therefore be had by advertising.
('38', 442, 1, 15, 884767) The reason why we have not got efficient stenography is because no endeavour has been made to train stenographers.
('38', 442, 1, 16, 884882) It is quite possible for instance to make of Chhaganlal, Mahadev, Krishnadas, Pyarelal and many others whom I can name first class stenographers.
('38', 442, 1, 17, 885028) But it was considered not worth while doing so.
('38', 442, 1, 18, 885076) It would have been like throwing away a rupee for a pice, and so we are managing with fourth rate stenographers hoping that if they assimilate the spirit of the movement they will distinguish themselves in the work they have undertaken by coming up to the highest level.
('38', 442, 1, 19, 885347) I have entered into this elaborate argumentvery badly expressed because it is for the first time that I am reducing to writing this thought about the movementbecause I am anxious that you who are saturated with the spirit of the spinning movement should understand all that is at the back of my mind and then give me the benefit of your criticism.
('38', 442, 1, 20, 885695) If I have not expressed myself clearly, as I
('38', 443, 0, 1, 885740) 444 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 443, 1, 2, 885782) am afraid I have not, do not please hesitate to ask me for further explanation and by an interchange of a few letters, probably, I shall be able to express myself more clearly than I have done.
('38', 443, 1, 3, 885976) But of course apart from what I have said above, there is much to be said for your view.
('38', 443, 1, 4, 886065) Young India and Navajivan are not all I want them to be.
('38', 443, 1, 5, 886122) There are reasons for it into which however I need not enter just now.
('38', 443, 1, 6, 886193) Some are avoidable and some are unavoidable.
('38', 443, 1, 7, 886238) I hope to be able to cope with those that are avoidable.
('38', 443, 1, 8, 886295) I got the book on vitamins.
('38', 443, 1, 9, 886323) I read it through as soon as I got it.
('38', 443, 1, 10, 886362) It is a good book.
('38', 443, 1, 11, 886381) But it failed to convince me.
('38', 443, 1, 12, 886411) The subject of vitamins has still, so far as I can see, to be investigated.
('38', 443, 1, 13, 886487) The authors statement does not appear to me to be the final word.
('38', 443, 1, 14, 886553) Their ruling out all the nuts and the pulses in preference to meat foods goes against the grain and is contrary to all I have read in the vegetarian literature.
('38', 443, 1, 15, 886714) If what the authors have said be the final word about them, it is a severe blow to vegetarianism.
('38', 443, 1, 16, 886812) But the authors could not possibly have sufficient data about the effect of nuts and pulses to enable them to come to a just decision.
('38', 443, 1, 17, 886947) Accurate observation about the efficacy or the inefficacy of vegetable protein foods can only be made on an extensive scale in India, where alone one meets thousands of born vegetarians.
('38', 443, 1, 18, 887134) Their diet and their habits have to be scientifically observed and analysed before safe deductions can be drawn; and then, too, there are so many disturbing factors.
('38', 443, 1, 19, 887300) Climate, harmful customs and suchlike have to be taken into account before using the values of foods taken by them.
('38', 443, 1, 20, 887416) I am therefore taking all the statements in that book with a great deal of caution.
('38', 443, 1, 21, 887500) The late A. F. Hills was President of the Vegetarian Society in London.
('38', 443, 1, 22, 887572) He was a good man.
('38', 443, 1, 23, 887591) I do not know the extent of his scientific knowledge.
('38', 443, 1, 24, 887645) But he indulged in bold speculations about diet.
('38', 443, 1, 25, 887694) He carried on a series of experiments himself.
('38', 443, 1, 26, 887741) He wrote a number of articles on what he called vital food.
('38', 443, 1, 27, 887801) He divided foods into three or four divisions: one for those whose occupation was pre dominantly body labour; another for those whose occupation was predominantly intellectual; third for those whose occupation was predominantly spiritual and the fourth for those who were not in a healthy condition.
('38', 443, 1, 28, 888101) His reasoning used to appeal to me in those days.
('38', 443, 1, 29, 888151) I do not know whether it would now if I read all his writings afresh.
('38', 443, 1, 30, 888221) I followed also keenly the controversy going on in the medical profession in those days about food values, and I know that
('38', 444, 0, 1, 888344) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 445
('38', 444, 1, 2, 888387) one army of doctors defended white bread for all they were worth, and another army suggested that white bread was the staff of death and that the brown bread alone was the staff of life.
('38', 444, 1, 3, 888574) There was even a Bread Reform League with Miss Yates as its energetic Secretary.
('38', 444, 1, 4, 888655) I used to come in close contact with the lady.
('38', 444, 1, 5, 888702) But I learnt even then that either side was fanatical, either produced statistics and analysis of various types of bread.
('38', 444, 1, 6, 888824) No one had sufficient data for its absolute conclusions.
('38', 444, 1, 7, 888881) For they could not set a large number of men, who would for the sake of their observations, live purely on brown bread and water or white bread and water.
('38', 444, 1, 8, 889036) I remember one example that was given by a doctor.
('38', 444, 1, 9, 889087) I think it was Dr. Allinson.
('38', 444, 1, 10, 889116) He said he put one of his dogs upon white bread for one month and it died; and another upon brown bread for one month and it lived.
('38', 444, 1, 11, 889248) The irresistible inference was that white bread was the staff of death and brown bread was the staff of life.
('38', 444, 1, 12, 889358) He did not state whether both the dogs were kept under restraint the whole of the time, nor did he state whether both the dogs started with the same stamina.
('38', 444, 1, 13, 889516) Let me confess that in those days, that is nearly 40 years ago, I sided with Dr. Allinson and I swallowed his testimony about the dogs and used to eat nothing but brown bread, and in the brown bread variety also, largely Allinsons brown bread; because, the worthy doctor took care to emphasize the necessity of taking Allinsons brown bread, for that alone contained the whole wheat meal ground to the necessary fineness.
('38', 444, 1, 14, 889937) He was a good man.
('38', 444, 1, 15, 889956) I read all his writings.
('38', 444, 1, 16, 889981) Even in 1914, I consulted him when I was suffering from pleurisy when I constantly refused to take even milk.
('38', 444, 1, 17, 890091) Probably the worthy doctor is still alive.
('38', 444, 1, 18, 890134) All the same I came to discount, as experience ripened, most of the argument of the type I have mentioned.
('38', 444, 1, 19, 890241) The upshot of all this is to tell you that I have not made many changes in my food beyond what I reported to you.
('38', 444, 1, 20, 890355) I still take unboiled milk.
('38', 444, 1, 21, 890383) I dilute it with water.
('38', 444, 1, 22, 890407) The milk that comes fresh from the goats is poured over boiling water; that gives the necessary warmth to the milk and addition of water makes it lighter.
('38', 444, 1, 23, 890562) I am taking yet a little bread or a little bhakhari made of home ground wheat, and I am taking one green vegetable.
('38', 444, 1, 24, 890678) The authors of the book say that addition of soda destroys the vitamins in the vegetables.
('38', 444, 1, 25, 890769) But without soda, the vegetables refuse to be soft.
('38', 444, 1, 26, 890821) I have therefore decided to add soda to the vegetable.
('38', 444, 1, 27, 890876) It is difficult to digest it unless it is thoroughly cooked.
('38', 444, 1, 28, 890937) Uncooked green cabbage, my system rejects.
('38', 444, 1, 29, 890980) You will have observed that all the four vitamins are to be found in milk.
('38', 444, 1, 30, 891055) They are to be found also in the fruits I am taking and therefore I do not lose
('38', 445, 0, 1, 891135) 446 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 445, 1, 2, 891177) much by adding soda at the time of cooking cabbage or Indian marrow.
('38', 445, 1, 3, 891246) There is no difficulty about the cooking of spinach without soda and so whenever I get spinach, soda is not added.
('38', 445, 1, 4, 891361) There is no occasion for worry about my health; for, I seem to be getting better though slowly.
('38', 445, 1, 5, 891457) No food will give me personal satisfaction unless I can revert to fruits and nuts.
('38', 445, 1, 6, 891540) But it seems to me that I shall have to close this earthly life without getting that personal satisfaction.
('38', 445, 2, 7, 891648) Yours sincerely, [PS.] Forgive me this very long letter.

('38', 445, 5, 11, 891808) NANDI DURG, Krishna 11 [May 27, 1927] 1
('38', 445, 6, 12, 891848) MAGANLAL, I have heard what you wrote about Ramachandra to Mahadev.
('38', 445, 6, 13, 891916) I have nothing to say about it at this moment.
('38', 445, 6, 14, 891963) Since you have handed over my letter to him, watch its effect.
('38', 445, 6, 15, 892026) Talk over the matter with Jamnalalji when he comes there and do what is necessary.
('38', 445, 6, 16, 892109) Then if there is anything for me to write, let me know.
('38', 445, 6, 17, 892165) Govindjis letter is very nice.
('38', 445, 6, 18, 892196) I have conveyed to him the thoughts it raised in me.
('38', 445, 6, 19, 892249) Herewith a copy of my reply.
('38', 445, 6, 20, 892278) 2 Read it yourself and let Narandas too read it.
('38', 445, 6, 21, 892327) If he has not read the original letter, let him do so.
('38', 445, 6, 22, 892382) If any ideas occur to you on reading my reply, write to me.
('38', 445, 6, 23, 892442) If there is in it anything that you do not understand, please let me know.
('38', 445, 6, 24, 892517) We would obviously be imperfect in a field where we do not at all wish to compete with the other party.
('38', 445, 6, 25, 892621) But where we do so or where we claim to specialize, we should try and be as perfect as possible.
('38', 445, 6, 26, 892718) There will be no difficulty in publishing in Navajivan or Young India any material that you think should appear, if you send it to me and if I approve it.
('38', 445, 6, 27, 892873) If you let me have a draft of an advertisement of books that ought to be taken notice of in Young India or Navajivan, I shall do what is necessary.

('38', 446, 7, 10, 893585) In order not to delay replying for two days I am resorting to dictation.
('38', 446, 7, 11, 893658) I do not want to break the rule as far as possible of not writing letters myself except during silence.
('38', 446, 7, 12, 893762) Both your letters are precious.
('38', 446, 7, 13, 893794) I now understand the Ashram much better than I ever did before.
('38', 446, 7, 14, 893858) It is almost like having been there myself and seen it.
('38', 446, 7, 15, 893914) So characteristic is your account, and it is usefully supplemented by Valunjkers letter.
('38', 446, 7, 16, 894003) You did well in not entering into the comparative merits of respective parties, and I do hope that you will remain unmoved even if you hear comparisons that may not please you.
('38', 446, 7, 17, 894180) Those who enter into comparisons do so honestly.
('38', 446, 7, 18, 894229) That it is improper to enter into such comparisons they do not know.
('38', 446, 7, 19, 894298) And what is the use of being ruffled by listening to an expression of views honestly held?
('38', 446, 7, 20, 894389) This use of bhang is a disturbing factor, and if it is not checked in time, it will prove the undoing of that institution.
('38', 446, 7, 21, 894512) But you are again right in not insisting on the reform.
('38', 446, 7, 22, 894568) You have not gone there as a supervisor or an inspector to make reforms.
('38', 446, 7, 23, 894641) You have gone there to perfect your study of Hindi and in so doing to give such service as you can and as may be acceptable.
('38', 446, 7, 24, 894766) And that brings me to your Hindi.
('38', 446, 7, 25, 894800) You have been quickened into action yourself.
('38', 446, 7, 26, 894846) Of course our formula has been Hindi first, everything else after.
('38', 446, 7, 27, 894913) I had felt that the formula was being somewhat overlooked.
('38', 446, 7, 28, 894972) In my letters whilst you were in Delhi, I had emphasized this thing when you were discussing the various limitations of the Delhi Gurukul.
('38', 446, 7, 29, 895111) But I thought that to bring the formula up and further in my letters would be undesirable, and I
('38', 447, 0, 1, 895208) 448 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 447, 1, 2, 895250) knew that you were yourself on the watch and would pull yourself up if you found yourself napping.
('38', 447, 1, 3, 895349) This you have now done, and I am glad and quite satisfied.
('38', 447, 1, 4, 895408) Of course there are innumerable things you can do usefully wherever you are placed.
('38', 447, 1, 5, 895492) And the test of the possession of the religious sense really consists in ones being able to pick out the rightest thing out of many things which are all right more or less.
('38', 447, 1, 6, 895665) This is the meaning of a verse in the Bhagavad Gita which says: Better even to die doing ones duty, however lowly it may be, than doing some others however grand it may be. 1 And so, I have myself not a shadow of doubt that you will be entitled to pass by many things which you can easily do, if the one thing for which you have left Sabarmati has at all to be sacrificed or neglected.
('38', 447, 1, 7, 896051) And, if there or at any other place, you become an unwelcome visitor because of your insistence upon that one thing, that is sufficient warning for you to leave the place.
('38', 447, 1, 8, 896223) And when you feel that imperative call, you will simply not listen to any other suggestion.
('38', 447, 1, 9, 896315) But that burning overpowering desire must come from within.
('38', 447, 1, 10, 896375) I must not goad, I will not goad.
('38', 447, 1, 11, 896409) I shall be entirely satisfied with what progress you can make, no matter how slow it is.
('38', 447, 1, 12, 896498) You will do your Hindi in the way that you think is best, and if you find that it is more conducive to your peace of mind to have several other occupations side by side with Hindi, you will take them up.
('38', 447, 1, 13, 896702) Do not therefore please continuously think of what I would like, but do what you think you can easily, without impairing your health, of both body and mind; and in the execution of your plan when you want my assistance or advice, you shall fall back upon it immediately, as for instance about going to Brij Kishan.
('38', 447, 1, 14, 897017) Your telegram leads me to think that now there is no occasion for you to leave that Ashram.
('38', 447, 1, 15, 897109) But you evidently do not know that Brij Kishan has not been keeping well and has therefore been sent to Mussoorie.
('38', 447, 1, 16, 897224) But if you desire to go to Delhi, I doubt not that you could go to Brij Kishens house although he himself is not there.
('38', 447, 1, 17, 897344) And of course there are many places where you can be sent for your Hindi, if Bhagwadbhakti Ashram does not give you all you want in the shape of Hindi, With love,

('38', 448, 1, 2, 897608) 449. LETTER GULZARILAL NANDA
('38', 448, 2, 3, 897637) NANDI HALLS, May 28, 1927
('38', 448, 3, 4, 897663) MY DEAR GULZARILAL, I was delighted to hear from you.
('38', 448, 3, 5, 897717) Whilst lying on my bed, I have constantly thought of so many like you in whom I am deeply interested and from whom, I expect many large and big things if only God will give them the requisite health for the task before them.
('38', 448, 3, 6, 897942) Your description of a truly religious life is accurate.
('38', 448, 3, 7, 897998) I have not a shadow of a doubt that this blessed state of inward joy and freedom from anxiety should last in the midst of the greatest trials conceivable.
('38', 448, 3, 8, 898153) It admits of no exception whatsoever.
('38', 448, 3, 9, 898191) Naturally, it is unattainable except by the very fewest.
('38', 448, 3, 10, 898248) But that it is attainable by human beings, I have also no doubt.
('38', 448, 3, 11, 898313) That we do not find in history evidence regarding the existence of any such person merely proves to me that all the record that we have has been prepared by imperfect beings, and it is impossible for imperfect beings to give us a faithful record of perfect ones.
('38', 448, 3, 12, 898576) The same may be said of our own experiences.
('38', 448, 3, 13, 898621) We have to be very nearly perfect in order to meet perfect souls as you have described.
('38', 448, 3, 14, 898709) Nor need you think that I have laid down an absurd proposition inasmuch as it is incapable of being recorded, or being experienced by the average man.
('38', 448, 3, 15, 898860) To raise such a doubt would be begging the question, for we are here picturing to ourselves extraor dinary mortals, though mortals nevertheless, and surely extra ordinary powers are required to find out these extraordinary mortals.
('38', 448, 3, 16, 899092) This statement is true even of much lesser things, things almost ridiculous, and yet very difficult of accomplishment, such, for instance, as the discoveries of Sir J. C. Bose or the finest paintings.
('38', 448, 3, 17, 899293) Both these, we average beings will have to take on trust.
('38', 448, 3, 18, 899351) It is only the privileged few who have got the special faculty for understanding and appreciating either those discoveries, or those paintings.
('38', 448, 3, 19, 899495) These do not appear to us to be incredible and we are able to accept them on faith only because in favour of these we have the testimony of a larger number of witnesses than we can possibly have for the things of permanent value, such as human perfection of the utmost type.
('38', 448, 3, 20, 899770) Therefore the limitation that you have accepted is quite a workable thing for the time being.
('38', 448, 3, 21, 899864) For, even inside the limitation, there is ample scope for widening the field for the progress of the state of being and remaining unruffled in the face of the onslaught of sorrows and trials, which before regeneration would have paralysed us.
('38', 448, 3, 22, 900107) I am glad you have intensified your devotions.
('38', 448, 3, 23, 900154) I do not know
('38', 449, 0, 1, 900168) 450 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 449, 1, 2, 900210) what you are reading at present.
('38', 449, 1, 3, 900243) And I do not know whether I told you that we must arrive at a time when we do not need the solace of many books but that we make one book yield us all we want.
('38', 449, 1, 4, 900403) In the last stage, of course, when life becomes one of perfect surrender and complete self effacement, the support of even one book becomes unnecessary.
('38', 449, 1, 5, 900556) At the present moment, though I am reading many things, the Bhagavad Gita is becoming more and more the only infallible guide, the only dictionary of reference, in which I find all the sorrows, all the troubles, all the trials arranged in the alphabetical order with exquisite solutions.
('38', 449, 1, 6, 900844) I think I did tell you that the Song Celestial was the best rendering I had come across of the Bhagavad Gita.
('38', 449, 1, 7, 900954) But if you do not know Sanskrit, I know that a knowledge of Sanskrit to enable you to understand the Bhagavad Gita is easily within your power.
('38', 449, 1, 8, 901098) You can almost in a months time know enough Sanskrit to understand the original text.
('38', 449, 1, 9, 901184) For, though the English rendering is grand and though you might be able to get some Hindi or Urdu translation also, of course there is nothing like the original.
('38', 449, 1, 10, 901346) The original will enable you to give your own meaning and gloss to the text.
('38', 449, 1, 11, 901423) That book is not a historical record, but it is a record of the concrete experiences of its author, whether it was really Vyasa or not I am not concerned.
('38', 449, 1, 12, 901578) And if it is a record of anybodys experience, it must not be beyond us to be able to test the truth of it by repeating the experience.
('38', 449, 1, 13, 901713) I am testing the truth almost every day in my life and find it never failing.
('38', 449, 1, 14, 901791) This of course does not mean that I have reached the state described, for instance, at the end of the Second Chapter.
('38', 449, 1, 15, 901909) But I know that the more we carry out the prescription given in it, the nearer do we answer the description given of the perfect state.
('38', 449, 1, 16, 902045) I hope you are keeping good health.
('38', 449, 1, 17, 902081) I am of course making steady progress.
('38', 449, 1, 18, 902120) Yours sincerely, BAPU

('38', 450, 3, 6, 902480) Please do not have any anxiety about my health.

('38', 450, 7, 12, 902778) NANDI HILLS, May 28, 1927
('38', 450, 8, 13, 902804) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter of the 20th instant.
('38', 450, 8, 14, 902857) I do not know why you considered my letter of the 1st January to be insulting.
('38', 450, 8, 15, 902936) I can only give you my assurance that no insult was intended.
('38', 450, 8, 16, 902998) The paragraph you have copied in your letter, I do not understand.
('38', 450, 8, 17, 903065) You are wrong in inferring that the letter of 1st January was either dictated or prompted by Pandit Motilalji.
('38', 450, 8, 18, 903176) I had left the Congress before the session was over, and I did not know that Pandit Motilalji was in Calcutta on the 1st January.
('38', 450, 8, 19, 903306) But whether he was or not, he certainly knew nothing even of the fact that I was writing to you.
('38', 450, 8, 20, 903403) I simply felt that I would be doing a friendly turn by writing to you as I did.
('38', 450, 9, 21, 903483) 1 Permanent address
('38', 451, 0, 1, 903503) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 451, 1, 2, 903545) I know nothing about the Lakhna Raj case.
('38', 451, 1, 3, 903587) Your letter was the first information to me about even the existence of Lakhna Raj.
('38', 451, 1, 4, 903671) That there was any case in connection with it, I had no knowledge whatsoever.
('38', 451, 1, 5, 903749) I venture to think that your description of Pundit Motilalji is, to say the least, ungentlemanly.
('38', 451, 1, 6, 903847) He may be all the things you have said of him, but the code of honour prevalent in good society debars one from impugning before a stranger the character of any man, whoever he may be.
('38', 451, 1, 7, 904032) And, after all, I am a perfect stranger to Your Highness.
('38', 451, 1, 8, 904090) In spite of your imputations on the character of Pundit Motilalji he remains for me a high souled, able, self sacrificing patriot enjoying in the country a position not attained by many public workers.
('38', 451, 1, 9, 904292) As it happens at the present moment, his politics are not my politics.
('38', 451, 1, 10, 904363) But if they were mine, I should certainly deem it an honour to allow my judgement to be influenced and tested by his.

('38', 451, 6, 16, 904637) DEAR DOCTOR, I have your letter.
('38', 451, 6, 17, 904670) Though I do not propose to trouble you to come over here, I would like you definitely, if you can, to write out what you will have me do, and I shall incorporate as many of your suggestions as it is possible for me.
('38', 451, 6, 18, 904886) I cannot get distilled water in Nandi.
('38', 451, 6, 19, 904925) I know that it can be made by oneself.
('38', 451, 6, 20, 904964) But I have not got the proper tubes and utensils for it here.
('38', 451, 6, 21, 905026) When I go down to Bangalore, I shall see whether I can procure distilled water.
('38', 451, 6, 22, 905106) As it is, I take raw milk diluted with boiling water.
('38', 451, 6, 23, 905160) This seems to agree with me better.
('38', 451, 6, 24, 905196) I am taking 30 ounces of raw milk and about two ounces of whole meal flour turned into bhakhari to which is added a little butter, soda and salt.
('38', 451, 6, 25, 905342) I take also one vegetable well boiled and added to it a tea spoonful of fresh butter from goats milk.
('38', 451, 6, 26, 905444) I add to the morning milk the juice of 10 full grown leaves of neem
('38', 452, 0, 1, 905512) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 453
('38', 452, 1, 2, 905555) I sleep well and I do about four hours dictation daily, one hours writing and at least one hours reading.
('38', 452, 1, 3, 905661) This is fair amount of work for a patient who is convalescing.
('38', 452, 1, 4, 905724) In addition to this, I have half an hours fairly brisk walk in the morning and half an hour in the evening.
('38', 452, 1, 5, 905832) And I retire at 9 in the night and get up at 4 in the morning.
('38', 452, 1, 6, 905895) Of course the morning and the evening prayers are there.
('38', 452, 1, 7, 905952) I do also deep breathing morning and evening.
('38', 452, 1, 8, 905998) I sleep about an hour and half during the day with an earth bandage on the head.
('38', 452, 1, 9, 906079) Now you may make any suggestions you like.
('38', 452, 1, 10, 906122) Now about yourself.
('38', 452, 1, 11, 906142) I am really most anxious to help you.
('38', 452, 1, 12, 906180) But, in spite of all the goodwill in the world, I have not been able to enthuse over your treatment.
('38', 452, 1, 13, 906281) I think it is wrong to say that all the patients I placed at your disposal were those who had passed through many doctors and had almost been given up.
('38', 452, 1, 14, 906433) You had Prabhudas, you had his grandfather, you had Gomatibehn, you had Navin, and many others whose names I can recall if I tax my memory.
('38', 452, 1, 15, 906573) Your insistence upon eggs and your great partiality for astrology are two serious drawbacks.
('38', 452, 1, 16, 906666) I respect your insistence upon eggs.
('38', 452, 1, 17, 906703) But they dont suit my religious sense.
('38', 452, 1, 18, 906742) I respect also your partiality for astrology.
('38', 452, 1, 19, 906788) But I cannot get rid of my scepticism about it.
('38', 452, 1, 20, 906836) Therefore I can only make a limited use of your attainments.
('38', 452, 1, 21, 906897) I wonder whether you have studied the use of asanas as part of treatment of disease.
('38', 452, 1, 22, 906982) My attention has been recently drawn to them.
('38', 452, 1, 23, 907028) But as you have a fair knowledge of physiology, I would like you, in the light of that knowledge, to examine the claims made on behalf of the various asanas.
('38', 452, 1, 24, 907186) Have you also studied the newest researches made about vitamins?
('38', 452, 2, 25, 907251) Yours sincerely, DR.

('38', 453, 7, 14, 907979) TARA, Your letter.
('38', 453, 7, 15, 907998) I learn from Surendras letter that you have grown very weak.
('38', 453, 7, 16, 908059) Strength which is lost will come back only gradually.
('38', 453, 7, 17, 908113) Need I tell you to have patience?
('38', 453, 7, 18, 908147) Moreover, the presence of Nathji is for you a soothing balm.
('38', 453, 7, 19, 908208) I write this not with the expectation of any reply from you but only to bring you peace, if I can.
('38', 453, 7, 20, 908307) Ramniklal will write, if necessary; if you want to convey anything to me, tell him about it.
('38', 453, 7, 21, 908400) But on no account should you write yourself.
('38', 453, 7, 22, 908445) I find from my own experience that good fresh milk, that is, pure milk if available there, is easier to digest, when mixed with boiling water.
('38', 453, 7, 23, 908588) Moreover, all doctors here agree that if a cow is free from disease, if its udders are washed, if the container is clean and the milkman washes his hands well with hot water before milking the cow, such fresh milk when taken without boiling is more nourishing and easier to digest.
('38', 453, 7, 24, 908870) If it is boiled, the vitamins are destroyed.

('38', 454, 1, 2, 909169) 455. LETTER TO LAKSHMIDAS May 28, 1927
('38', 454, 2, 3, 909208) BHAI LAKSHMIDAS, Your letter.
('38', 454, 2, 4, 909238) I have read Bhai Jethalals letter.
('38', 454, 2, 5, 909273) We have been doing khadi work in the native States.
('38', 454, 2, 6, 909325) But I have always had a fear that when the impact of khadi begins to tell on foreign cloth, it will be attacked from all quarters; I doubt whether at that time we shall be able to carry on our work in the native States.
('38', 454, 2, 7, 909545) If our tapascharya is prolonged and sincere, we might perhaps survive such attacks.
('38', 454, 2, 8, 909629) Now the question naturally arises what stand we should take in the native States during this transitional period.
('38', 454, 2, 9, 909743) My inner voice tells me that we should plainly reject [their favour] if it means giving undertakings which would compromise our honour.
('38', 454, 2, 10, 909879) How can we give in writing anything that would seem like ignoring Pathik and Ramnarayan?
('38', 454, 2, 11, 909968) We should talk to them politely and try to persuade them.
('38', 454, 2, 12, 910026) We propose to do only khadi work in your territories.
('38', 454, 2, 13, 910080) That too as a matter of business.
('38', 454, 2, 14, 910114) We have no wish to interfere in the affairs of your State. This we shall state, if you like, in writing.
('38', 454, 2, 15, 910219) We wish to do khadi work in your State merely from the business point of view.
('38', 454, 2, 16, 910298) But we do not want this to be interpreted to mean that even outside your State we will have nothing to do with politics or that we have no line of thought on the subject.
('38', 454, 2, 17, 910469) We have no political affiliations with Pathik and others, but we do not wish to by pass them in any way; nor do we regard them as traitors.
('38', 454, 2, 18, 910609) But we do not wish to be instrumental in harming them in their relations with you. I think we should boldly say something to this effect.
('38', 454, 2, 19, 910747) If we do not act in some such way khadi will lose its power.
('38', 454, 2, 20, 910808) If the Government takes away khadi work from us and gets it done arbitrarily through its own machinery, shall we be able to attach all the power to khadi that we do today?
('38', 454, 2, 21, 910980) In short, we would swallow many a bitter pill for the sake of khadi.
('38', 454, 2, 22, 911049) We may put up with personal insults, but even khadi work may not be carried on under such circumstances as would compromise our principles.
('38', 454, 2, 23, 911189) The fact is that under such circumstances, khadi work simply cannot be done.
('38', 454, 2, 24, 911266) Perhaps you are not aware that an attempt was made to get the Charkha Sangh registered.
('38', 454, 2, 25, 911354) The Charkha Sangh is an independent limb of the Congress enjoying the power to secede from the parent body.
('38', 454, 2, 26, 911462) The officials agreed to register it if this spiritual bond were broken.
('38', 454, 2, 27, 911534) We decided against getting the Charkha Sangh registered and
('38', 455, 0, 1, 911594) 456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 455, 1, 2, 911636) declined to snap that bond.
('38', 455, 1, 3, 911664) Well, I am dictating this from a height of 5,000 feet; you may therefore look at it in the right perspective after making the necessary allowances.
('38', 455, 1, 4, 911812) I write not for being acted upon, but only because it may help you in finding some solution.
('38', 455, 1, 5, 911905) I have discussed this matter with Jamnalalji to some extent.
('38', 455, 1, 6, 911966) He will soon be at the Ashram when you too should see him and do what you all wish to.
('38', 455, 1, 7, 912053) But then the masters advice must be left at the door.

('38', 455, 4, 11, 912192) 456. WELCOME DONATION FOR CAUSE OF SUPPRESSED CLASSES
('38', 455, 5, 12, 912246) A telegram has been received from Shri Vallabhbhai saying that a generous gentleman has donated Rs. 50,000 for the benefit of the suppressed communities, and another has donated Rs. 2,500. I saw in the papers that the name of the first donor is Mansukhlal Chhaganlal.
('38', 455, 5, 13, 912514) It seems that the other has not thought it proper to let his name be known.
('38', 455, 5, 14, 912590) I congratulate both these gentlemen.
('38', 455, 5, 15, 912627) My conviction grows stronger day by day that such thoughtful donations are alone religious charities.
('38', 455, 5, 16, 912729) It is a happy sign that the desire to make donations for religious causes is still alive among us.
('38', 455, 5, 17, 912828) But we hardly know what is religion.
('38', 455, 5, 18, 912865) I have often said that in this age much adharma is done in the name of dharma.
('38', 455, 5, 19, 912944) On the one hand, therefore, we have to nurse the religious sentiment of the people and, on the other, we have to point out the right way for the exercise of that sentiment.
('38', 455, 5, 20, 913117) Good intentions by themselves do not take one to heaven.
('38', 455, 5, 21, 913174) There is a saying in English that the path to hell is paved with good intentions.
('38', 455, 5, 22, 913256) There is much truth in this.
('38', 455, 5, 23, 913285) Many thieves steal with good motives.
('38', 455, 5, 24, 913323) Many are those who tell lies with good motives.
('38', 455, 5, 25, 913371) Even a religious person like Yudhishthira makes the mistake of uttering a falsehood with a good motive, and for that he had to suffer the stink of hell.
('38', 455, 5, 26, 913524) We see ourselves that numerous murders are committed with good motives.
('38', 455, 5, 27, 913596) Hence, good intentions by themselves are unavailing.
('38', 455, 5, 28, 913649) They should be accompanied by good deeds, and that is possible only if we have right knowledge.
('38', 455, 5, 29, 913745) It would

('38', 456, 2, 4, 913993) 457. MEANS OF COW PROTECTION
('38', 456, 3, 5, 914022) Shri Pragji Mavji, manager of the pinjrapole in Nasik, makes the following suggestions in a letter 1 which he has written: In these suggestions there is not much that is new and has not been said in Navajivan.
('38', 456, 3, 6, 914232) But I have printed them to show how a devoted servant of mother cow and experienced manager of a pinjrapole supports the suggestions which have been made earlier in these columns.
('38', 456, 3, 7, 914412) The letter also contains some useful information.
('38', 456, 3, 8, 914462) For instance, the information about the use which contractors make of dead cattle, if these are handed over to them, is such as will shock us.
('38', 456, 3, 9, 914605) Such wicked things happen because, in the name of religion, people themselves do not make use of the dead animals but hand them over to others.
('38', 456, 3, 10, 914749) The suggestion in regard to bones needs some modification.
('38', 456, 3, 11, 914808) Burying bones as they are does not produce manure; they have to be ground into powder.
('38', 456, 3, 12, 914895) The flesh and intestines need not be buried.
('38', 456, 3, 13, 914940) Intestines are used even now for making leather strips, strings for musical instruments and catguts, and the fat obtained from flesh is used in great quantities for lubricating machinery.
('38', 456, 3, 14, 915128) So there remains very little to be buried in its natural form.
('38', 456, 3, 15, 915191) But this concerns the future.
('38', 456, 3, 16, 915221) If we accept in principle that by making in goshalas and pinjrapoles all those things against the use of which we have no religious objection, we can save the maximum number of cattle, other discoveries will follow.
('38', 456, 3, 17, 915437) The reproach to cow protection workers implied in the last suggestion deserves attention.
('38', 456, 3, 18, 915527) Every such worker should bear in mind that there is a greater need for workers who will devote themselves to active work of service and make themselves proficient in their field of work than for preachers who go round exhorting others.
('38', 456, 3, 19, 915763) But, along with this letter 2, I have before me a press cutting containing a long interrogatory addressed to me on the question of
('38', 456, 4, 20, 915894) 1 Not translated here 2 What follows is the translation as found in Young India, 3 11 1927.
('38', 457, 0, 1, 915986) 458 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 457, 1, 2, 916028) cow protection.
('38', 457, 1, 3, 916044) The underlying suggestion obviously seems to be that the methods of cow protection advocated by me are not consistent with my profession of Hinduism.
('38', 457, 1, 4, 916194) For in his introductory remarks to his questions the writer has tried to make light of the basic principle of cow protection that I have formulated, viz., that what is economically wrong cannot be religiously right.
('38', 457, 1, 5, 916410) In other words, if a religion cuts at the very fundamentals of economics it is not a true religion but only a delusion.
('38', 457, 1, 6, 916530) My critic on the other hand believes that this view is opposed to the teachings of our ancient scriptures.
('38', 457, 1, 7, 916637) I, at least, am not aware of a single text in opposition to this view nor do I know of any religious institution that is being maintained in any part of the world today in antagonism to the elementary principles of economics.
('38', 457, 1, 8, 916863) As for Nature, anyone who has eyes can see, that it always observes the principle that I have stated.
('38', 457, 1, 9, 916965) For instance, if it has implanted in its creation the instinct for food it also produces enough food to satisfy that instinct from day to day.
('38', 457, 1, 10, 917108) But it does not produce a jot more.
('38', 457, 1, 11, 917144) That is Natures way.
('38', 457, 1, 12, 917165) But man, blinded by his selfish greed, grabs and consumes more than his requirements in defiance of Natures principle, in defiance of the elementary and immutable moralities of non stealing and non possession of others property and thus brings down no end of misery upon himself and his fellow creatures.
('38', 457, 1, 13, 917470) To turn to another illustration, our Shastras have enjoined that the Brahmin should give knowledge as charity without expecting any material reward for it for himself.
('38', 457, 1, 14, 917638) But they have at the same time conferred upon him the privilege of asking for and receiving alms and have laid upon the other sections of the community the duty of giving alms, thus uniting religion and economics in a common bond of harmony.
('38', 457, 1, 15, 917880) The reader will be able to find further instances of this kind for himself.
('38', 457, 1, 16, 917956) The religious principle requires that the debit and credit sides of ones balance sheet should be perfectly square.
('38', 457, 1, 17, 918071) That is also the truest economics and therefore true religion.
('38', 457, 1, 18, 918134) Whenever there is any discrepancy between these two it spells bad economics and makes for unrighteousness.
('38', 457, 1, 19, 918241) That is why the illustrious author of the Gita has defined yoga as balance or evenness.
('38', 457, 1, 20, 918329) But the majority of man kind do not understand this use of economics to subserve religion; they want it only for amassing profits for themselves.
('38', 457, 1, 21, 918475) Humanita rian economics, on the other hand, for which I stand, rules out profits altogether.
('38', 457, 1, 22, 918568) But it rules out deficit no less for the simple reason that it is utterly impossible to safeguard a religious institution by following a policy of dead loss.
('38', 457, 1, 23, 918726) That is the reason why in spite of
('38', 458, 0, 1, 918761) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 459
('38', 458, 1, 2, 918804) our 1,500 goshalas we have not only failed to protect the cow, but its slaughter is day by day on the increase.
('38', 458, 1, 3, 918916) If in spite of this we delude ourselves into the belief that we have done our duty by the cow by establishing these homes for cattle, and remain smugly self satisfied there, whatever comfort it may give us, it wont bring us one whit nearer the goal of cow protection, whereas it can be demonstrably shown that by adopting the policy that I have suggested we can easily realize this goal.
('38', 458, 1, 4, 919304) It does not require much effort to see that but for the fact that the cow yields us milk, the duty of cow protection would not have come into being at all.
('38', 458, 1, 5, 919460) There are a host of other innocent animals besides the cow in the world but nobody has ever thought of setting up their protection as a religious obligation, and if somebody had attempted it, it would have simply remained a dead letter.
('38', 458, 1, 6, 919697) We have use for the cow.
('38', 458, 1, 7, 919722) That is why it has become religiously incumbent on us to protect it.
('38', 458, 1, 8, 919791) To turn now to the questionnaire drawn up by my critic, I will embody the questions in my answers without reproducing them separately: 1. Every goshala or Pinjrapole should have a tannery adequate to its needs attached to it.
('38', 458, 1, 9, 920017) In other words, the manager in charge of every such institution should have a thorough knowledge of the immediate steps necessary for utilizing the remains of dead cattle.
('38', 458, 1, 10, 920189) If this is done, the question, viz., how many heads of cattle should a particular goshala contain, wont arise at all.
('38', 458, 1, 11, 920307) 2. I do not know what the rate of mortality of cattle in goshalas is, nor is it relevant to my proposition.
('38', 458, 1, 12, 920415) So long as there is a single head of cattle in a goshala, its manager ought to know how to dispose of its remains after it is dead, just as he is expected to know how to look after it while it is alive.
('38', 458, 1, 13, 920618) 3. Such humanitarian institutions for the protection of cattle as I have described should normally take charge of the remains of the cattle that might die in the village.
('38', 458, 1, 14, 920789) Therein lies the interest of the cattle, the depressed classes and the general public alike.
('38', 458, 1, 15, 920882) In villages where there are no goshalas or the concomitant tanneries, some local person who believes in cow protection should take it upon himself to get the carcasses removed to the nearest tannery or get the preliminary processes performed upon it and send the useful parts there.
('38', 458, 1, 16, 921165) 4. The establishment of such tanneries as I have described does not require much capital outlay.
('38', 458, 1, 17, 921262) Only some initial expenditure
('38', 459, 0, 1, 921292) 460 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 459, 1, 2, 921334) would be needed to train up workers for this work.
('38', 459, 1, 3, 921385) 5. It is true that at present the leather prepared from slaughtered hides is superior in quality to that prepared from dead hides.
('38', 459, 1, 4, 921516) But during the late War the Government of India spent enormous sums of money to improve the quality of leather from dead hides; and tannery experts have told me that dead hides can be tanned into as good leather as leather from slaughtered hides.
('38', 459, 1, 5, 921763) I myself am conducting experiments in this direction.
('38', 459, 1, 6, 921817) In Cuttack, Sjt.
('38', 459, 1, 7, 921834) Madhusudan Das has been doing the same for a number of years and with success as he tells me.
('38', 459, 1, 8, 921928) The Calcutta Government Research Tannery is also at present engaged in similar experiments.
('38', 459, 1, 9, 922020) But the tragedy of it today is that we annually export crores worth of hides to foreign countries, and by ignorantly using leather goods made from the hides of slaughtered cattle, become indirectly participators in the sin of their slaughter.
('38', 459, 1, 10, 922263) It rests in our hands entirely to prevent the export of hides of our dead cattle to foreign countries.
('38', 459, 1, 11, 922366) And this we can easily do by bringing the export trade in hides under our control through the establishment of tanneries on altruistic lines.
('38', 459, 1, 12, 922508) We cannot only save nine crores of rupees annually to our country but by employing that sum properly save a countless number of cattle.
('38', 459, 1, 13, 922644) I need hardly say that the humanitarian tanneries that I have suggested would also be utilizing the bones and other useful parts of the dead cattle.
('38', 459, 1, 14, 922793) In fact it is more necessary than ever.

('38', 461, 3, 7, 925503) What I wanted to say was that although I liked handwritten letter, there was no occasion for you to revert to writing your letters for my sake and that you should continue type writing as you believe in it, and as I know it does result in economy of time.
('38', 461, 3, 8, 925759) Nor do I consider your handwriting to be bad.
('38', 461, 3, 9, 925805) It might be clearer.
('38', 461, 3, 10, 925826) But fortuna tely for my friends I have my own writing as the criterion and that being so, I know very few whose writing is worse than mine, and yet because of my dislike of typewriters, if I could possibly write with my own hand, I will inflict that illegible hand in preference to having my letters typed or typing them myself.
('38', 461, 3, 11, 926155) The reason underlying is this.
('38', 461, 3, 12, 926186) If I have any concern for my friends, I should endeavour to write a better and more legible hand.
('38', 461, 3, 13, 926284) Typewriter is a cover for indifference and laziness.
('38', 461, 3, 14, 926337) Moreover I believe in the dictum handwriting reveals the writer.
('38', 461, 3, 15, 926402) Typewriting certainly results in economy of time.
('38', 461, 3, 16, 926452) But whilst I admit that time is money, I do not admit that money is everything, and therefore I can conceive innumerable occasions when economy of time would be misplaced.
('38', 461, 3, 17, 926624) And the inroads that the typewriter is making have all but destroyed the magnificent art of calligraphy.
('38', 461, 3, 18, 926729) I wonder if you have seen old handwritten manuscripts when people used to pour forth their very soul into their work.
('38', 461, 3, 19, 926847) But I must not stray away from the subject on which I want to write.
('38', 461, 3, 20, 926916) Your suggestions about selecting a few untouchable boys and making them ideal farmers does great credit to your heart.
('38', 461, 3, 21, 927035) But it betrays your ignorance of the situation.
('38', 461, 3, 22, 927083) Even if half a dozen untouchables could be trained as you suggest, that will in no way bring us nearer the solution of the problem of untouchability.
('38', 461, 3, 23, 927233) To petrify on this matterHindu mind will immediately say, we shall touch every untouchable who qualified as these six men have.
('38', 461, 3, 24, 927361) You perhaps know that there have been many and many pariah saints, but their sainthood has not saved this suppressed class.
('38', 461, 3, 25, 927485) The orthodox mind again argues the pariah saint becomes so because of his past karma and he naturally commands our respect.
('38', 461, 3, 26, 927609) When the others do likewise, they will also command the same respect.
('38', 461, 3, 27, 927679) It is this immoral
('38', 462, 0, 1, 927698) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 463
('38', 462, 1, 2, 927741) deduction from the theory of karma which has got to be combated at every step and the Hindu mind has got to be educated by fierce penance and understanding that the theory of karma is not intended to kill all reform and all efforts, but that it is intended for mankind to work out all evil karma and he who does not do so is not entitled to belong to the human species.
('38', 462, 1, 3, 928111) The Hindu mind has therefore to be educated to regard intrinsically as equals the lowest, the fallen and the downtrodden and to give them a helping hand so as to make them level with the rest.
('38', 462, 1, 4, 928304) And why, apart from the question of untouc hability, should not the most promising young men be sent out to become accomplished farmers and try the experiment suggested by you?
('38', 462, 1, 5, 928481) Surely you do not wish to imply that the touchables in their pride will not care to learn farming with a view to utilizing human excreta as manure.
('38', 462, 1, 6, 928629) If that is your argument, it would be wrong to expect untouchables to handle work which others would consider as degrading.
('38', 462, 1, 7, 928753) As you know at the Ashram, we have untouchable boys.
('38', 462, 1, 8, 928806) We do not even ask them to do the sanitary work.
('38', 462, 1, 9, 928855) The initiative is taken by the so called high caste men; for, on such points the so called untouchables would be very touchy.
('38', 462, 1, 10, 928981) I am having that experience everywhere.
('38', 462, 1, 11, 929021) Underlying your suggestion, therefore, is the question not of untouchability but of improved farming methods along simple lines.
('38', 462, 1, 12, 929150) But I have simply not handled this question energetically because I believe in the doctrine of one thing at a time.
('38', 462, 1, 13, 929266) There is much scattered work here, so much laziness, so much blind imitation, so little concentration that it is necessary to hammer away at one very simple but fairly universal thing, and if that succeeds, the rest can follow.
('38', 462, 1, 14, 929494) And agriculture is an industry which can only be improved when it receives state assistance.
('38', 462, 1, 15, 929587) In an ill governed country, I think with Thoreau that the citizen who resists the evil government must ignore property rights.
('38', 462, 1, 16, 929714) And without assurance of settled ownership, it is impossible to do much in the way of agriculture.
('38', 462, 1, 17, 929813) I do not want to elaborate this thing.
('38', 462, 1, 18, 929852) I have said sufficient to enable you to fill in the rest.
('38', 462, 1, 19, 929910) Whilst your suggestion does not seem to me to be feasible so far as the untouchables are concerned and difficult of accomplishment, even as a general scheme the extract sent by you is valuable and I propose as soon as I find space to reproduce it in Young India so that those who are at all inclined in the direction might take the matter up.
('38', 462, 1, 20, 930253) I did not get the larger volume about vitamins.
('38', 462, 1, 21, 930301) What I got was Food and Health.
('38', 462, 1, 22, 930333) But that book also gives enough information about
('38', 463, 0, 1, 930383) 464 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 463, 1, 2, 930425) vitamins.
('38', 463, 1, 3, 930435) Dr. Kelloggs writings I know.
('38', 463, 1, 4, 930465) I have read his book, and if it has not been lost as many of my books have been, it must be in the Ashram library.
('38', 463, 1, 5, 930580) However, you seem to know him personally, and I shall look forward to what he has to say.
('38', 463, 1, 6, 930670) Have you put the whole case before him and asked whether he can suggest an effective vegetarian substitute for milk in the case of patients?

('38', 465, 3, 4, 933164) SISTERS,
('38', 465, 4, 5, 933173) There has been no letter from you this week.
('38', 465, 4, 6, 933218) Have you received any letters from Mirabehn?
('38', 465, 4, 7, 933263) I find from her letters that she has been working hard among both men and women.
('38', 465, 4, 8, 933344) There is in her letters something about which I would like you to know.
('38', 465, 4, 9, 933416) She writes that the women with whom she comes into contact are all extremely good, but at the same time terribly ignorant.
('38', 465, 4, 10, 933539) They do not know even the simplest things.
('38', 465, 4, 11, 933582) If Mirabehn talks to them of the spinning wheel, they are surprised.
('38', 465, 4, 12, 933651) They cannot of course understand that spinning is necessary in the interests of the poor.
('38', 465, 4, 13, 933741) Their idea of religion is visiting the temple.
('38', 465, 4, 14, 933788) They hardly know what service is.
('38', 465, 4, 15, 933822) It may be that some of this is a result of Mirabehns lack of experience.
('38', 465, 4, 16, 933895) But we are all aware of the general ignorance of our women.
('38', 465, 4, 17, 933955) It is men who are mainly responsible for this.
('38', 465, 4, 18, 934002) The only remedy lies, doesnt it, in their awakening.
('38', 465, 4, 19, 934055) But the responsibility for bringing about that awakening rests upon you.
('38', 465, 4, 20, 934128) All of you should prepare yourselves for the work according to your abilities.

('38', 466, 3, 5, 934509) I have no doubt that once you have mastered the elements of this science you will get thoroughly interested in it.
('38', 466, 3, 6, 934624) Learning the elements of anything is always difficult and irksome.
('38', 466, 3, 7, 934691) It is so with the delightful art of music too.
('38', 466, 3, 8, 934738) We all know about mathematics.
('38', 466, 3, 9, 934769) The same is the case of this grand and noble science of the charkha.
('38', 466, 3, 10, 934838) I call it grand because the more closely we study it the more we discover in it.
('38', 466, 3, 11, 934919) And we need as much skill to attain proficiency in it as in any other major craft.
('38', 466, 3, 12, 935002) I call this noble because it touches millions of people.
('38', 466, 3, 13, 935059) I know of no other science save agriculture which has such universal applica tion.
('38', 466, 3, 14, 935142) Therefore I wish your devotion to this task is strengthened.
('38', 466, 4, 15, 935203) I have understood your nature.
('38', 466, 4, 16, 935234) You keep away from a thing so long as your head and heart do not accept it fully and this is quite right.

('38', 467, 10, 21, 936305) If you feel hungry, you should increase the quantity of milk.
('38', 467, 10, 22, 936367) We get good milk there.
('38', 467, 10, 23, 936391) Hence it will be all right to take it even unboiled.

('38', 468, 7, 16, 937609) I have said my say.
('38', 468, 7, 17, 937629) I understand your reasoning and value your determination.

('38', 468, 7, 20, 937791) Personally, I challenge many of the authors conclusions.
('38', 468, 7, 21, 937848) But my challenge is based upon prejudice.
('38', 468, 7, 22, 937890) I attack their data on insufficiency of evidence; but I have no data myself to support my challenge.
('38', 468, 7, 23, 937991) I know the healthier condition of widows.
('38', 468, 7, 24, 938033) So far as Nikhil is concerned, he need never go to Calcutta.
('38', 468, 7, 25, 938094) If Hemaprabha Devi can be happy at the Ashram, she can live with Nikhil there and husband his strength.
('38', 468, 7, 26, 938198) Or, she can stay in Patna, and she can be in Wardha also with quarters all to herself.

('38', 469, 1, 3, 938556) Not to do Madras, if I can at all manage it, would be criminal as there is already nearly three lakhs of rupees collected and locked up and people will not part with it unless I present myself to receive it.
('38', 469, 1, 4, 938764) I can therefore combine rest and work.
('38', 469, 1, 5, 938803) It becomes fairly cool in the Madras Presidency in the month of July.
('38', 469, 1, 6, 938873) The whole of June will be spent in resting.
('38', 469, 1, 7, 938917) The Mysore tour will be easy, because Mysore is on a higher level.
('38', 469, 1, 8, 938984) It is a plateau of 3,000 feet above the sea level and the climate at this time of the year is exceptionally mild.
('38', 469, 1, 9, 939098) Then there are other parts of the Madras Presidency too which are quite cool.
('38', 469, 1, 10, 939176) And Karnatak is perfect after June.
('38', 469, 1, 11, 939212) You need have therefore no worry whatsoever, and, of course, I shall be taking soundings as the tour progresses.
('38', 469, 1, 12, 939325) What is more, the ever kind and the ever vigilant Nature will give warning betimes of any danger that may be lurking.
('38', 469, 1, 13, 939443) And then, in spite of all the extraordinary precautions, she will one day send her messenger who like a thief in the night will steal in some day and unperceived by anybody administer the dose which will send me to long sleep.

('38', 469, 6, 18, 939819) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('38', 469, 6, 19, 939852) Either Jamnalalji committed a blunder or the interviewer.
('38', 469, 6, 20, 939910) There is absolutely no chance even if I become obdurate of my being able to resume my tour in the middle of June.
('38', 469, 6, 21, 940024) Let alone the doctors, I have myself no such confidence.
('38', 469, 6, 22, 940081) Nandi has done me good.
('38', 469, 6, 23, 940105) But there is much leeway yet to be made up.
('38', 469, 6, 24, 940149) I get easily tired and I cannot move about with ease.
('38', 469, 6, 25, 940203) A month more is the very least I

('38', 470, 1, 3, 940294) What I feel is that I shall not be able to venture out much before the third week of July.
('38', 470, 1, 4, 940385) Rajagopalachari is not just now here.
('38', 470, 1, 5, 940423) He has gone to Bangalore to find and prepare quarters for me there as the weather here is now becoming too bracing for me.
('38', 470, 1, 6, 940546) He is the jailor in charge and it is he who has to dispose of me finally, so far as this Presidency is concerned.
('38', 470, 1, 7, 940660) But in so far as I have any control over my rnovements, I would certainly love to be your guest if Salem is on the list at all.
('38', 470, 1, 8, 940788) And, if it is not on the list, you can easily have it on the list by collecting a fat purse for the dumb millions from among your innumerable friends in Salem.
('38', 470, 1, 9, 940948) I never know that the European Association at Calcutta had passed such an original resolution as you have described.
('38', 470, 1, 10, 941065) Yes, I do feel, without being able to assign any justification for the feeling, that behind all the seeming anarchy, order is being evolved and that we shall not for ever remain a damned country.

('38', 471, 3, 5, 942144) At the present moment I can only ask you to read the reprint of the articles I wrote in Young India.
('38', 471, 3, 6, 942245) The reprint is called Self restraint v.

('38', 471, 3, 8, 942302) It can be had at the Young India office, Ahmedabad.

('38', 471, 3, 10, 942497) Meanwhile I can only pray that God may give you the right guidance and strength of mind to do the right thing.

('38', 471, 7, 16, 942779) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('38', 471, 7, 17, 942812) As I do not know whether the English letter is written by you or for you, I shall have a translation of this letter enclosed with this.
('38', 471, 7, 18, 942948) It is not because I do not want to comply with your proposal but because I have no fitness for becoming anybodys guru, being myself in search of one.
('38', 471, 7, 19, 943098) After all a person who sets out to become anybodys guru, if he is a sincere man, must have confidence in himself.
('38', 471, 7, 20, 943212) The relation of a teacher and disciple is not a mechanical one but it is organic.
('38', 471, 7, 21, 943294) The only suggestion, therefore, that I can make to you is that if you cannot be satisfied with personal effort and struggle, you can have the guru of your imagination; but then it wont be my conscious self; for I should be utterly incapable of giving you unerring guid ance which a true guru is supposed to give and you may draw what

('38', 472, 5, 11, 944152) I am afraid, your notions of business and mine seem to be so diametrically opposite, that it is not possible at the present moment to find a meeting ground, and after all, our depots, it seems to me, cannot be of any service to you.

('38', 472, 10, 17, 944506) MY DEAR JAIRAMDAS, I have your letter.
('38', 472, 10, 18, 944545) I understand your difficulties and your struggles as I have always done and have therefore sympathized with you even whilst I have been powerless to give you any help or guidance.
('38', 472, 10, 19, 944725) Personally, as I have implied in my letter to the President, I have not much faith in patched up compromises brought about by mutual fear.
('38', 472, 10, 20, 944864) And then, the contracts made by us, polished patriots, have no effect upon the masses, who either act under the impulse of the moment or under the guidance of mischief makers.
('38', 472, 10, 21, 945040) We, the so called representatives of the people, build airy houses of our own imagination.
('38', 472, 10, 22, 945131) But I suppose the imaginary is real to the one who sees it as such, and what is real is imaginary to him.

('38', 473, 5, 10, 945788) TUSI MAHER,
('38', 473, 6, 11, 945800) I have your letter.
('38', 473, 6, 12, 945820) I am sorry to read of your illness.
('38', 473, 6, 13, 945856) You need not have been over enthusiastic.
('38', 473, 6, 14, 945898) All that we do must be done with a detached mind.
('38', 473, 6, 15, 945948) And nothing done in this way will be beyond our capacity and therefore affect our health.
('38', 473, 6, 16, 946038) You should spare no pains so long as you are not attached to results.
('38', 473, 6, 17, 946108) To exert oneself beyond that is to ruin ones health and undo the work done.
('38', 473, 6, 18, 946184) That was the cause of my breakdown.
('38', 473, 6, 19, 946220) I did not observe even a nominal limit to my capacity during and after my tour of Maharashtra.
('38', 473, 6, 20, 946315) Now I am paying the penalty ten times over.
('38', 473, 6, 21, 946359) Had I added even of a quarter of the last two months (spent in rest] to the Maharashtra tour, the programme would have been completed smoothly and possibly I would have been spared this illness.
('38', 473, 6, 22, 946554) For me the shore is in sight but you have just set out on your voyage.
('38', 473, 6, 23, 946625) Taking a lesson from my case you should calm down and do quietly whatever you can.
('38', 473, 6, 24, 946708) Milk and ghee may be taken without any qualms if considered necessary for recouping your strength.
('38', 473, 6, 25, 946807) Havent I said that a friend who gives up milk and ghee is himself responsible for the risk incurred and that if he cannot sustain his body with this abstinence he must forthwith return to the milk and ghee diet.

I now understand that the pamphlet was seen by one of my companions; but, as it was seen a long time after its receipt by him and as I was in the midst of my work which hardly left me time to see any pamphlet, he did not bring it to my notice.
('38', 475, 1, 3, 948861) I am sorry that it remained without acknowledgement.
('38', 475, 1, 4, 948914) I have now sent for it.
('38', 475, 1, 5, 948938) I have leisure enough during my convalescence to look at your pamphlet; and if I trace it, I shall certainly read it and let you have my views upon it.
('38', 475, 1, 6, 949090) I am sorry that you had to remain in suspense for such a long time with reference to the two matters about which you had a right to expect from me at least an acknowledgement and it is contrary to my habit to leave such things unacknowledged.

('38', 475, 3, 11, 949604) But I wish to place a suggestion before you.
('38', 475, 3, 12, 949649) Fasting concerns the body.
('38', 475, 3, 13, 949676) Hence, though it has an important place in ones spiritual develop ment, relatively it is a small thing.
('38', 475, 3, 14, 949780) It is a means and serves a useful purpose only when the mind is behind it.
('38', 475, 3, 15, 949855) I know that your mind cannot but be behind your fast, otherwise you could not have fasted for so many days.
('38', 475, 3, 16, 949963) Nevertheless please think more deeply over the matter and reconsider it.
('38', 475, 3, 17, 950036) Do you fast for some sort of self puri fication?
('38', 475, 3, 18, 950085) Do you weigh afterwards the benefits of your fasts?
('38', 475, 3, 19, 950137) Or are you indifferent towards them?
('38', 475, 3, 20, 950174) If you are, how do you justify your fasts as spontaneous acts?
('38', 475, 3, 21, 950237) The desire for fruit is implicit in describing a fast as meant for self purification.
('38', 475, 3, 22, 950323) This is not an unworthy desire; it is a worthy one.
('38', 475, 3, 23, 950375) In interpreting what is meant by the desire for fruit, one must use discrimination.
('38', 475, 3, 24, 950459) Ones duty is to be a mumukshu.
('38', 475, 3, 25, 950490) A mumukshu is one who aspires after moksha.

('38', 476, 1, 2, 950821) renunciation of the desire for fruit is that one who renounces it knows that the fruit does follow.
('38', 476, 1, 3, 950921) He does not mind if he himself does not enjoy that fruit.
('38', 476, 1, 4, 950979) Absence of the desire for fruit makes a man courageous and helps to maintain the purity of the means.
('38', 476, 1, 5, 951081) But I have written more than I should.
('38', 476, 1, 6, 951120) My aim was merely to caution you.

('38', 476, 5, 16, 951545) But I propose to write nothing that needs be conveyed to anyone.

('38', 476, 5, 22, 951822) I write regularly to pujya Malaviyaji.
('38', 476, 5, 23, 951861) No sooner had I written to him this week than a lengthy telegram arrived from him, telling me that his health was now better but weakness persisted.
('38', 476, 5, 24, 952010) He is at present in Bombay.
('38', 476, 5, 25, 952038) It wont be right to say I do not take care of my health.
('38', 476, 5, 26, 952095) I do take all the precautions that I think are necessary to preserve my health.
('38', 476, 5, 27, 952175) Pujya Malaviyaji does not do it as I have complained on many occasions and he took no rest even after solemnly promising to do so.
('38', 476, 5, 28, 952306) He has great faith in the treatment of vaidyas and believes that he keeps and can keep well by taking their pills and powders.
('38', 476, 5, 29, 952433) And so strong is his self confidence that in spite of his weakness and ill health he is determined to live at least up to seventy five.
('38', 476, 5, 30, 952569) May God carry him through his resolve.
('38', 476, 5, 31, 952608) Who can try to persuade him?
('38', 476, 5, 32, 952637) I have written to him in a lighter vein but with as much severity as can be combined with courtesy.
('38', 476, 5, 33, 952737) The truth is that mans wisdom is determined by his past karma.
('38', 476, 5, 34, 952800) In such matters there is very little scope for human effort.
('38', 476, 5, 35, 952861) It is our duty to try and we

('38', 477, 1, 2, 952966) ought to do it but there comes in the life of every man a time when all effort appears futile and luckily God gives us no fore knowledge of the end so as to avoid the frustration.
('38', 477, 1, 3, 953146) Why then worry over the inevitable?
('38', 477, 1, 4, 953182) The affairs of the nation depend neither upon Malaviyaji nor upon Lalaji 1 nor upon me.
('38', 477, 1, 5, 953270) All are but instruments; moreover I think a good mans efforts bear fruit only after his death.
('38', 477, 1, 6, 953365) It is not correct as Shakespeare says, the evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.
('38', 477, 1, 7, 953486) Evil does not endure.
('38', 477, 1, 8, 953508) Rama is still in our midst and we cherish his memory.
('38', 477, 1, 9, 953562) Ravana and his wickedness are no more.
('38', 477, 1, 10, 953601) Not even the wicked utter his name.
('38', 477, 1, 11, 953637) Who knows what Rama was in his own age?
('38', 477, 1, 12, 953677) The poet certainly says that in his own lifetime even Rama did not escape recriminations.
('38', 477, 1, 13, 953767) But now all his imperfections have, with his body, turned to ashes and we worship him as an incarnation of God.
('38', 477, 1, 14, 953879) And the Kingdom of Rama is much wider now than it ever was while he lived in the body.
('38', 477, 1, 15, 953966) When I write this I dont mean to philosophize or persuade you to suppress your feelings.
('38', 477, 1, 16, 954055) But I emphasize that we should never grieve over the death of one whom we regard as a saint.
('38', 477, 1, 17, 954148) And we must have the firm belief that a saints deeds begin to work or, say, truly bear fruit only after his death.
('38', 477, 1, 18, 954263) The achievements which were regarded as great in his own time are only infinitesimal compared to the influence they will have in times to come.
('38', 477, 1, 19, 954407) Yet it is certainly our duty to emulate to the best of our ability the good deeds of those whom we regard as saints of our age.
('38', 477, 1, 20, 954535) Regarding your health I would suggest if you have no faith in allopathy, and you need not have it, that you should visit the institutions of Louis Kuhne and Just when you go to Germany.
('38', 477, 1, 21, 954721) Their treatment with open air and water has benefited hundreds of people.
('38', 477, 1, 22, 954795) Contact the Vegetarian Society both at London and Manchester.
('38', 477, 1, 23, 954857) There are always some nice, serious minded people to be found there who will be courteous and considerate.
('38', 477, 1, 24, 954964) Of course, you will come across some faddists and fanatics too.
('38', 477, 1, 25, 955028) You said milk was not available on the steamer.
('38', 477, 1, 26, 955076) Next time you should carry Horlicks Malted Milk.
('38', 477, 1, 27, 955125) It is pure milk powder.
('38', 477, 1, 28, 955149) The chemists say that this dehydrated powder contains all that milk does.

('38', 478, 2, 3, 955404) This is a simple example of how to see action in non action.
('38', 478, 2, 4, 955465) With a spinning wheel or the Gita or the Ramayana in ones hand one can never say that one has no work to do.
('38', 478, 2, 5, 955574) Till we are so content in our minds that we feel thus, we are bound to be restless for one reason or another.
('38', 478, 2, 6, 955684) You ought to get over such restlessness; I have always expected that of you.
('38', 478, 2, 7, 955761) You should finish with lightning speed whatever task falls to you in the natural course of events.

('38', 478, 4, 11, 955945) 482. LETTER TO MANILAL NATHUBHAI DOSHI [After Jane 1, 1927] 2
('38', 478, 5, 12, 956007) I got your letter.
('38', 478, 5, 13, 956026) Brahmacharya is to be observed in three ways in mind, in speech and in body.
('38', 478, 5, 14, 956103) As long as the mind feels the slightest evil desire, there is always a danger of the desire for indulgence being aroused.
('38', 478, 5, 15, 956225) The evil desires of the mind are not controlled in a moment; their control, being the aim of mans highest effort, takes ages to attain.
('38', 478, 5, 16, 956361) It is logical to believe that a person who conquers the evil desires in him in this life has succeeded in doing so by reason of the efforts in many lives rather than merely through his efforts in this life.
('38', 478, 5, 17, 956568) If in our conscious moments the body is about to violate brahmacharya, it is our duty at that time to commit suicide and destroy the body.
('38', 478, 5, 18, 956707) Hence one cannot be too vigilant towards ones body; anyone who cannot be so vigilant has yet to learn the first lesson of brahmacharya.
('38', 478, 5, 19, 956843) Brahmacharya in speech is practically included in bodily brahmacharya, for, though it is the mind that inspires speech, in itself speech is a bodily function.
('38', 478, 5, 20, 957002) There remains the mind.
('38', 478, 5, 21, 957026) As one acquires greater control over the mind, one finds it easy to keep the body under control without having to struggle to do so, but until the mind is completely subjugated, there is a chance of involuntary emission.
('38', 478, 5, 22, 957247) We should not be frightened at such emission.
('38', 478, 5, 23, 957293) It is the mind we should fear.
('38', 478, 5, 24, 957324) Involuntary emission is Natures warning
('38', 478, 6, 25, 957364) 1 In the source these two letters follow the entries for June 1, 1927 2 ibid.
('38', 479, 0, 1, 957442) 480 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 479, 1, 2, 957484) to us that the mind has not been subjugated.
('38', 479, 1, 3, 957529) We see that even lustful men remain complacent because they do not have involuntary emissions.
('38', 479, 1, 4, 957624) They feel pleased with themselves because of their freedom from such emissions.
('38', 479, 1, 5, 957704) But, truly speaking, their being self satisfied in this manner is their fall.
('38', 479, 1, 6, 957782) In America they employ means which prevent involuntary emissions while the mind remains filled with lustful thoughts.
('38', 479, 1, 7, 957900) But to regard such a man as a brahmachari amounts to murdering the language.
('38', 479, 1, 8, 957977) Hence, though safeguarding of the vital fluid is the external form of brahmacharya, one cannot definitely say that its preservation is necessarily a manifestation of brahmacharya.
('38', 479, 1, 9, 958157) Nevertheless, there is no doubt that it is an essential aspect of complete brahmacharya.
('38', 479, 1, 10, 958246) My point in writing this is that, if there is involuntary emission despite our continuous and sincere struggling to avoid it, despite our vigilance and after we have neglected to adopt no measure which can possibly help us to avoid it, we need not get frightened or lose heart and feel that we have committed a great sin; rather we should look upon it as kind Natures warning and look deeper into ourselves.
('38', 479, 1, 11, 958654) We should find out where evil desires are lurking in the mind and strive harder still to banish them.
('38', 479, 1, 12, 958756) The effort is its own reward.
('38', 479, 1, 13, 958786) If we have been cheating ourselves and mentally indulging our secret desires, we should make sure that we run away from those activities or associations which cause our downfall or make us weak.
('38', 479, 1, 14, 958981) It should not matter if, in doing so, one ruins ones business or loses ones wealth and passes for a fool among the people.
('38', 479, 1, 15, 959104) It is necessary to be almost completely free from sensuous desires in order to be blessed by the vision of God; the desires that still remain will be destroyed only by that vision.
('38', 479, 1, 16, 959285) There is no sure means which can help us to have this vision.
('38', 479, 1, 17, 959347) No one else can bring us to it.
('38', 479, 1, 18, 959379) Truly speaking, the Shastras and those learned in them can only recount their experiences, and, if we lack faith, their experience may awaken faith in us; but no one else can make the necessary effort on our behalf.
('38', 479, 1, 19, 959595) I can, therefore, tell you only this: do not give up your struggle for a single moment.
('38', 479, 1, 20, 959683) To get a vision of God is the highest aim of human effort.
('38', 479, 1, 21, 959742) Add up, therefore, all the struggles that human beings are ready to undertake to get certain things in this world and add up all those efforts; it is necessary, in order to get a vision of God, to make an effort a myriad times more difficult than the sum of all those struggles of human beings in this world.
('38', 479, 1, 22, 960051) If one does not gain that vision, even after such an effort, one will be free to raise ques tions; there will be some justification for lack of faith then.
('38', 479, 1, 23, 960207) But, till
('38', 480, 0, 1, 960217) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 481
('38', 480, 1, 2, 960260) then, we must not give up our faith and our struggle.
('38', 480, 1, 3, 960314) The example of Mansukhlal which you have cited is inappro priate.
('38', 480, 1, 4, 960380) He possessed much knowledge of the Shastras, and he struggled [for self control] but he had not become free from desire, neither did he make such a claim.
('38', 480, 1, 5, 960535) Hence the fact that he felt a desire for a thing like a water melon during his last hours is not enough reason to fill us with despair or to justify our disparaging him.
('38', 480, 1, 6, 960705) We should not deceive ourselves and believe, living in these evil times and in this world full of difficulties, that we can easily become free from desires, nor should we entertain such expectations even of a person whom we believe to be good lest we get a shock or doubt his goodness when we have a contrary experience of him.
('38', 480, 1, 7, 961033) We should remember that the souls power is unlimited.
('38', 480, 1, 8, 961087) He whose desires have totally perished is practically fit to be God.
('38', 480, 1, 9, 961156) Let us not believe that good men with whom we come in contact have gained such fitness and thereby reduce Gods measuring rod to the littleness of our finger.
('38', 480, 1, 10, 961314) If we see any person standing even on the first notch on that yardstick, we should feel happy and hope that, if one person can become fit enough to stand on the first notch, all of us can, if we but try, acquire the strength to stand on the second notch, and strive on in that hope.

('38', 480, 4, 15, 961710) I gladly publish these notes 1 from Sjt.
('38', 480, 4, 16, 961751) C. V. Vaidya.
('38', 480, 4, 17, 961765) Those, who believe in the methods advocated in these columns for cow protection, will be glad to find, that a scholar of Sjt.
('38', 480, 4, 18, 961891) C. V. Vaidyas repute is in substantial agreement with those methods.
('38', 480, 4, 19, 961960) The distinction that the learned writer draws between pinjrapole and goshala need not cause any anxiety or difficulty.
('38', 480, 4, 20, 962079) My own opinion is, that either may be also the other, so long as separate accounts are kept and separate methods of feeding and housing the disabled and the working animals are adopted.
('38', 480, 4, 21, 962265) Legislation and the State aid advocated by Sjt.
('38', 480, 4, 22, 962313) Vaidya need not at present distract our attention.
('38', 480, 4, 23, 962364) For there is immense scope for private effort, building public opinion in favour of the proposed

('38', 481, 1, 2, 962525) methods and showing their workability in practice.
('38', 481, 1, 3, 962576) We are so far behind, indeed, that we have not even enough trained workers to conduct dairies and tanneries along the lines suggested by Sjt.
('38', 481, 1, 4, 962718) Vaidya.
('38', 481, 1, 5, 962726) There are at least 1,500 pinjrapoles and goshalas according to the figures in my possession, which can, without much further donation, but by efficient management, test the usefulness of the methods.
('38', 481, 1, 6, 962926) Their adoption will simply revolutionize the management of these institutions and put life into these, today for the most part, lifeless bodies.
('38', 481, 1, 7, 963071) These pinjrapoles and goshalas, as they are at present being conducted, are more a salve to our conscience than a protection to the cow.
('38', 481, 1, 8, 963208) The learned writers categorical statement, that during the Vedic and the Brahmana period cow slaughter was countenanced and beef was eaten, will be hotly contested by Pandit Satavalekar, who has been a close student of Vedic lore for the past 35 years, and by Acharya Ramadeva who claims to be a historian and to have critically studied the ancient history of Bharatavarsha.
('38', 481, 1, 9, 963583) But with the historical portion practical men and women will not concern themselves.
('38', 481, 1, 10, 963668) They will perhaps be content like me to hope that our ancestors in the Vedic times knew better than to seek to gain merit by sacrificing innocent animals or to satisfy their palate by eating beef.

('38', 481, 4, 13, 963909) A correspondent sends me a cutting from the Press giving most gruesome facts about the growing infantile crimes and illicit gratifica tion among girls in the New World.
('38', 481, 4, 14, 964078) A boy of four years is reported to have shot his mother, because she forbade him to play with matches.
('38', 481, 4, 15, 964181) When the police confronted him, he was in no way taken aback.
('38', 481, 4, 16, 964243) He threatened to shoot them too, and when questioned by the Coroner, he grew so impatient with him that he picked up a knife from among the exhibits lying in front of him and rushed to strike him.
('38', 481, 4, 17, 964440) It is said, that hardly a day passes in America without some crime being committed by a boy or a girl, and in most American colleges there are said to be suicide clubs or crime societies, and the more horrible part of the account shows that many girls, even of exclusive colleges, have become so lawless as to run away in pursuit of illicit adventures.
('38', 481, 4, 18, 964793) It is difficult, in an age in which newspapers, in order to provide
('38', 482, 0, 1, 964861) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 483
('38', 482, 1, 2, 964904) sensational food for their readers, invent stories when they have no facts to weave narratives from, to believe without reservation reports such as I have condensed.
('38', 482, 1, 3, 965070) But whilst one may make ample allowance for exaggeration, there is no doubt that infantile crime and lawlessness among boys and girls are sufficiently extensive in the New World to make us beware of a civilization which must be held responsible for these crimes and lawlessness.
('38', 482, 1, 4, 965349) That life in the West goes onand it may be said progressively after a fashionin spite of these infantile crimes, may be granted.
('38', 482, 1, 5, 965478) And it may also be granted that the wise people of the West are not only not unaware of the evil, but that they are manfully struggling to overtake it.
('38', 482, 1, 6, 965630) Nevertheless we have to decide whether we shall indiscriminately copy this civilization.
('38', 482, 1, 7, 965719) We may well pause in the face of the awful revelations that come to us from the West from time to time, and ask ourselves, whether after all it is not better to hold by our own civilization and seek, in the light of the comparative knowledge that is available to us, to reform it by removing its known excrescences.
('38', 482, 1, 8, 966035) For, there is no doubt, that if the West has its terrific problem arising out of its own civilization, we have no less grave problems of our own to deal with.
('38', 482, 1, 9, 966194) It is perhaps unnecessary, if not useless, in this connection to weigh the merits of the two civilizations.
('38', 482, 1, 10, 966302) It is likely that the West has evolved a civilization suited to its climate and surroundings, and similarly, we have a civilization suited to our conditions, and both are good in their own respective spheres.
('38', 482, 1, 11, 966511) This may be safely said that the crimes and the lawlessness described by me are almost impossible with us, and I hold that this is due to our pacific training and the restraining influence in the midst of which we are brought up.
('38', 482, 1, 12, 966741) Cowardliness which often springs from pacific training, and obsequiousness which comes from the restraint that is handed down from generation to generation, have somehow to be avoided, if the ancient civilization is not to perish before the mad modern rush.
('38', 482, 1, 13, 966999) The distinguishing characteristic of modern civilization is an indefinite multiplicity of human wants.
('38', 482, 1, 14, 967102) The characteristic of ancient civilization is an imperative restriction upon and a strict regulating of those wants.
('38', 482, 1, 15, 967219) The modern or Western insatiableness arises really from want of a living faith in a future state and therefore also in Divinity.
('38', 482, 1, 16, 967348) The restraint of ancient or Eastern civilization arises from a belief, often in spite of ourselves, in a future state and the existence of a Divine Power.
('38', 482, 1, 17, 967503) The record condensed above is a warning if we will take it, against a blind imitation of the West, which one sees so often in the

('38', 483, 1, 3, 967738) Some of the immediate and brilliant results of modern inventions are too maddening to resist.
('38', 483, 1, 4, 967832) But I have no manner of doubt that the victory of man lies in that resistance.
('38', 483, 1, 5, 967911) We are in danger of bartering away the permanent good for a momentary pleasure.

('38', 483, 4, 8, 968050) Pandit Satavalekar of Aundh wrote in 1922 a booklet in Hindi called i.e., Charkha in the Vedas, and favoured me with a copy whilst I was resting in the Yeravda jail.
('38', 483, 4, 9, 968216) I glanced then through its pages and with interest, but asked myself what good would it be to us in this age of so called advancement to know that the charkha was to be found in the Vedas.
('38', 483, 4, 10, 968405) Everybody knows that our remote ancestors spun and wove in their cottages even as they did so many other things.
('38', 483, 4, 11, 968518) But we no longer do them.
('38', 483, 4, 12, 968544) So I said to myself.
('38', 483, 4, 13, 968565) The booklet, I hastily concluded, was not of much practical value and I laid it aside.
('38', 483, 4, 14, 968652) On the sick bed I have again an opportunity of turning, so far as my strength permits, to quiet studies.
('38', 483, 4, 15, 968757) Another book of Pandit Satavalekar (of which more hereafter) has attracted me to his writings, and he has now favoured me with another copy of the booklet in question.
('38', 483, 4, 16, 968925) I observe that it has undergone a second edition.
('38', 483, 4, 17, 968975) I have read it this time more carefully, and I find that the mantras cited by the author from the Vedas demonstrate not merely the fact that our ancestors in those times were spinning and weaving, but they present, perhaps, a, for us, novel way of looking at the wheel.
('38', 483, 4, 18, 969245) Here is what may be called the key mantra for spinners and weavers from Rig Veda (X. 53 6) quoted by the author:
('38', 483, 5, 19, 969358) I give a free rendering as follows: Having spun the thread and given it a shining colour, weave it without knots, and so guard the pathways which the enlightened have chalked out, and thinking well, lead posterity unto the divine light, or (according to the authors rendering) bring forth divine progeny.
('38', 483, 5, 20, 969663) This truly is the work of poets.
('38', 483, 5, 21, 969696) If the translation is at all correctand the author has not merely given his own rendering but has reproduced Griffiths translation also
('38', 484, 0, 1, 969832) 486 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 484, 1, 2, 969874) in his bookletthe mantra proves not merely the existence of spinning and weaving in the Vedic times, but that it was the calling of the noblest men and women as well of the humblest.
('38', 484, 1, 3, 970057) It was one of the pathways which wisdom hath prepared and to guard which was the work of poets.
('38', 484, 1, 4, 970153) Little did I know, when I humbly presented the charkha to our Poet 1 as a sacrificial rite, that I had behind me the authority of what is understood to be the oldest Veda.
('38', 484, 1, 5, 970325) I commend the mantra to all those who are engaged in reviving this ancient and sacred industry and art.
('38', 484, 1, 6, 970429) Let them thoughtfully recite this mantra whilst doing their sacrificial spinning.
('38', 484, 1, 7, 970511) Let them treasure it in their hearts and keep their faith unshaken even in the face of disap pointments and reverses in their forward march.
('38', 484, 2, 8, 970652) I cannot resist quoting another beautiful mantra from the booklet:
('38', 484, 3, 9, 970719) This is again from the Rig Veda (X. 130 1).
('38', 484, 3, 10, 970763) It means: Hundred and one artists are working at the sacrifice which through the myriad threads overspreads the earth.
('38', 484, 3, 11, 970882) Here are the elderly guardians.
('38', 484, 3, 12, 970914) They watch the processes saying,Weave on here, do this right there. Thus we see that spinning and weaving was regarded as a sacrifice even in those ancient days and commanded the protecting care of the elders.
('38', 484, 3, 13, 971124) The author shows abundant evidence that both spinning and weaving were done by men as well as women.
('38', 484, 3, 14, 971225) In fact the industry was as universal as farming.
('38', 484, 3, 15, 971275) He shows too that the sartorial art was well advanced in those times.
('38', 484, 3, 16, 971345) There were different dresses pres cribed for different occasions as also for different states.
('38', 484, 3, 17, 971440) If the farmer had his langoti 2, royalty had its robe.
('38', 484, 3, 18, 971495) There is mention of colours, fringes and gold borders.
('38', 484, 3, 19, 971550) The author has also shown that some of the most beautiful metaphors have been taken from the language of spinners and weavers.
('38', 484, 3, 20, 971677) I must resist the temptation to quote more extracts from this thoughtfully written booklet.
('38', 484, 3, 21, 971769) There is a mantra which proves that the

('38', 485, 1, 2, 971886) soldiers of those days were not above doing these processes; that the bridegrooms garment was always made by the bride as is still the custom in Assam.
('38', 485, 1, 3, 972038) There is one thing, however, the author leaves to other research scholars in the Vedic lore to discover.
('38', 485, 1, 4, 972143) So far as he has been able to study the Vedas, he has not found a single equivalent for cotton as he has for wool and silk.
('38', 485, 1, 5, 972267) He is, therefore, unable to say whether in those days our ancestors had only woollen and silken garments or whether they had already discovered the cotton fibres.

('38', 485, 4, 8, 972484) NANDI HILLS, June 2, 1927 I have your sweet little note.
('38', 485, 4, 9, 972541) But it is disturbing to think that you are not yet well.
('38', 485, 4, 10, 972598) If your recovery is dependent upon mine, well then you must already have recovered, because you had two letters from me telling you that I was on the road to recovery.
('38', 485, 4, 11, 972766) I hope you got those two letters.
('38', 485, 4, 12, 972800) But though I am on the road to recovery, I have to take care of myself and take plenty of rest.
('38', 485, 4, 13, 972896) I, therefore, do most of my correspondence lying down and through dictation.
('38', 485, 4, 14, 972973) Hence this typewritten letter.
('38', 485, 4, 15, 973004) You know my theory of the disease, dont you?
('38', 485, 4, 16, 973049) I regard it as a result of some conscious or unconscious sin as I call or breaches of Natures laws.
('38', 485, 4, 17, 973149) When you lose mental equanimity, be it ever so little, it sets up terrible agitations in the body, and these latter produce visible effects upon it.
('38', 485, 4, 18, 973298) I know that I am not free from these affections or perturbations as I would call them and I had the collapse.
('38', 485, 4, 19, 973408) I do not flatter myself with such unctuous pleas as overwork, terrific strain, etc., in order to drown my conscience.
('38', 485, 4, 20, 973526) On the contrary, I know that overwork and terrific strain are just as apprehensible, even though they may be in a good cause, as a drinking bout or visiting cinemas.
('38', 485, 4, 21, 973692) The results of both are the same.
('38', 485, 4, 22, 973726) And, if I have attained equanimity, I should unerringly know when to work, when not to work and should be able to have the same control over the mind as I should have over the body.
('38', 485, 4, 23, 973908) But I confess I have not.
('38', 485, 4, 24, 973934) The mind continuously gives me [the] slip and outruns me.
('38', 485, 4, 25, 973992) What wonder then that I am still convalescing?
('38', 485, 4, 26, 974039) But all this confession is merely a preface to tell you

('38', 486, 5, 8, 974456) DEAR FRIEND, It was good of you to have sent your article for Young India entitled The Present Situation.
('38', 486, 5, 9, 974562) But I am afraid that it will not be of much use for the readers of Young India.
('38', 486, 5, 10, 974642) That it will lead popular education is an admitted fact.
('38', 486, 5, 11, 974699) But the only question is how to do it and who shall do it.
('38', 486, 5, 12, 974758) And Young India is published either to suggest new lines of thought or to show practical methods of working out plans and policies already accepted.

('38', 486, 8, 19, 975153) I have ward to your letter especially after Perin had prepared me for It.
('38', 486, 8, 20, 975227) I am glad also of the confession.
('38', 486, 8, 21, 975261) But a good confession results in a change of ways.
('38', 486, 8, 22, 975312) But I see you have not yet become a Gujarati scholar, nor evidently did those excellent copy books sent by grandfather produce any impression upon you.

('38', 487, 1, 3, 975588) In spite of schoolmasters having put copy books before me, I write a hand much worse than yours.
('38', 487, 1, 4, 975685) I thought that Nargis had sent A.E.s book The Interpreters.
('38', 487, 1, 5, 975745) It came before your letter.
('38', 487, 1, 6, 975773) I think that very book was sent to me through Jaijee when I was in Yeravda.
('38', 487, 1, 7, 975849) But alas!
('38', 487, 1, 8, 975859) I was discharged before I could read the book through.
('38', 487, 1, 9, 975914) There is not much danger of a sudden discharge now.
('38', 487, 1, 10, 975966) I shall therefore read it and tell you what I think of it.
('38', 487, 1, 11, 976025) We remove to Bangalore on Sunday.
('38', 487, 1, 12, 976059) You must all come there.
('38', 487, 1, 13, 976084) There is going to be a Khadi Exhibition in July.
('38', 487, 1, 14, 976133) I am writting to Mithubehn about it, and if you could come for that exhibition, you could all become stall holders and take the Bangalore public by storm.

('38', 487, 3, 18, 976417) NANDI HILLS, June 3, 1927
('38', 487, 4, 19, 976443) MIRA, I have your letter.
('38', 487, 4, 20, 976469) It fills me with both sorrow and joy; sorrow because for the time being at any rate that Ashram has fallen in my estimation, and joy because you are so gentle and yet so brave.
('38', 487, 4, 21, 976646) You become a shield both for yourself and Gangu.
('38', 487, 4, 22, 976695) That you committed the initial mistake of accepting the invitation to witness the bhang preparation dwindles into insignificance in the face of your subsequent firmness combined with gentleness.
('38', 487, 4, 23, 976890) Your acceptance of the invitation was as good or as bad as acceptance of an invitation to watch the manufacture of brandy in a brewery.
('38', 487, 4, 24, 977026) But that acceptance itself was due to your great anxiety to please Maharajji and not out of any unpardonable or improper curiosity.
('38', 487, 4, 25, 977158) On reading your letter, my first thought was to wire to you for you, Valunjker and Gangu to leave the Ashram at once.
('38', 487, 4, 26, 977276) I then said to myself that that would be wrong especially when you had proved your presence of mind and bravery in the face of a wretched situation.
('38', 487, 4, 27, 977425) I therefore decided to write to you and give you my reflections and then let you act as you thought proper in the circumstances.
('38', 488, 0, 1, 977554) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 489
('38', 488, 1, 2, 977597) I regard the scene you have described as highly improper, even immoral, on the part of those who sought to tempt you and almost force the vile stuff down your throat and poor Gangus, and then as you turned your backs upon them, to sprinkle the dirty water was more like a scene in a tavern than in a brahmacharya Ashram, where service of God and man is supposed to be the goal and where brahmacharya is strictly enjoined.
('38', 488, 1, 3, 978019) Your fast was good for your purification.
('38', 488, 1, 4, 978061) It has washed you clean of the initial mistake, and if they will take it, it is a gentle warning to the managers of the Ashram.
('38', 488, 1, 5, 978189) It seems to me, however, that you should follow up the action by having a firm conversation with the Rao Saheb and other inmates, and, if you wish it, with the Maharajji himself.
('38', 488, 1, 6, 978368) Whereas in a previous letter 1 I told you that it was no business of yours to rid the Ashram of the bhang habit, now in view of the developments described by you, it becomes your duty either to end the bhang or to end your presence there.
('38', 488, 1, 7, 978607) I regard it to be next to impossible, both for men and women, to remain without sensual agitations whilst they are under the influence of bhang even though they may be able to exercise outward bodily control, though from my own experience of it, it seems to me that when I was under the influence of bhang any man or woman could have played fast or loose with me.
('38', 488, 1, 8, 978971) And now that your eyes have been opened, it would be improper to lend any countenance to that Ashram unless they are sincerely ready to reform their ways.
('38', 488, 1, 9, 979126) You may not co operate with the Ashram even to gain a kingdom or even if it was the only place where you could finish your Hindi course.
('38', 488, 1, 10, 979263) You may tell them that you are not there to impose your views, but as a friend you were bound to draw their attention to the evil which had forced itself upon your attention, and that unless the evil was eradicatedand that too not for your sake but out of convictionyou could not remain there to receive personal courtesies and personal favours in the shape of Hindi teaching.
('38', 488, 1, 11, 979640) If therefore they could not see eye to eye with you about the evil of bhang, you would still be friends with them but you couldnt possibly remain in the Ashram, nor Valunjker and Gangu who are also under the same discipline as you.
('38', 488, 1, 12, 979872) You may read this letter to whomsoever you like.
('38', 488, 1, 13, 979921) Discuss first with Valunjkerfor, he is a wise manthe propriety of the step I have suggested, see what he has to say, see also what Gangu has to say.
('38', 488, 1, 14, 980070) She is like a simple glorious child.

('38', 489, 1, 3, 980298) And then if you feel like referring to me, do so by all means.
('38', 489, 1, 4, 980361) If you wish to consult Jamnalalji, you may write to him also.
('38', 489, 1, 5, 980423) I am sending him your letter and a copy of this so that you dont have to say much to him.
('38', 489, 1, 6, 980513) Do nothing in a hurry, nothing in a huff, certainly nothing in anger; but take whatever step you wish after humble prayer and with the greatest deliberation.
('38', 489, 2, 7, 980671) I am perfectly at ease having dictated this letter.
('38', 489, 2, 8, 980723) Such experiences, when they come to us unsought, are precious trials that God sends to those who would listen to the still small voice within.

('38', 489, 7, 14, 981098) NANDI HILLS, June 3, 1927 DEAR FRIEND, I have carefully gone through your pamphlet Foundations of Swaraj, as also your manifesto.
('38', 489, 7, 15, 981228) About the manifesto, I cannot say anything because I do not know the facts.
('38', 489, 7, 16, 981304) About the pamphlet, I am sorry to say it was a deep disappointment to me.
('38', 489, 7, 17, 981378) You have lost yourself in the exuberance of your own language.
('38', 489, 7, 18, 981441) You have not taken the trouble of studying a movement, not by any means insignificant so far at least as its extent is concerned, and have set about demolishing a picture of your own imagination.
('38', 489, 7, 19, 981637) You have not cared to understand the implications of soul power or the implications of the spinning wheel.
('38', 489, 7, 20, 981744) The other chapters betray a most superficial study of questions handled by you.
('38', 489, 7, 21, 981824) I understood from you that you had 25 years experience of public service at your back.
('38', 489, 7, 22, 981911) It is a matter of deep sorrow to me that so many years of study should have brought forth such little fruit.
('38', 489, 7, 23, 982020) Please do not be flattered by the testimonials that you have received about your other book from distinguished newspapers.
('38', 489, 7, 24, 982143) I know nothing about the other book.

('38', 490, 7, 10, 982701) MY DEAR RAIHANA, What a wonderful and poetic love letter you have sent me!
('38', 490, 7, 11, 982776) I would wonder if my letter to Father crossed yours or whether this letter of yours is prompted by the reminder sent in my letter to Father.
('38', 490, 7, 12, 982917) Not only must I not write much myself, but I must not even dictate for any length of time.
('38', 490, 7, 13, 983008) I dont want therefore to chat with you long.
('38', 490, 7, 14, 983053) But let me hasten to tell you that if you can be happy and comfortable in the Ashram, I would love to have you in spite of your not doing any work with your hands.
('38', 490, 7, 15, 983217) Spinning by the hand is after all a test, an emblem, an earnest of what is within, and I know that you have all that substance within you.
('38', 490, 7, 16, 983356) What does it matter that through no present fault of your own, you are simply physically incapable of spinning.
('38', 490, 7, 17, 983468) The work done by the spirit within is infinitely precious, more precious than the formal spinning done by many without the heart in it.
('38', 490, 7, 18, 983604) Come therefore when you like to the Ashram as your very home and I shall certainly take all that your voice can give me.
('38', 490, 7, 19, 983725) But I should prize your presence even if you had not that rich melodious voice.
('38', 490, 7, 20, 983805) What I prize is your goodness, which can act without speaking.
('38', 490, 7, 21, 983868) It is like the fragrance of a sweet flower.
('38', 490, 7, 22, 983912) It does not need any movement and yet the fragrance is all pervading and unmistakable, and it survives for a while even after the flower is withdrawn.
('38', 490, 7, 23, 984063) How much longer must the fragrance of goodness last even after the body is

('38', 491, 1, 4, 984292) Do you write to Mira?
('38', 491, 1, 5, 984314) If not, do please now.

('38', 491, 7, 14, 984623) DEAR SIR, Whilst there remains any uncertainty about the legality of the resolution about Jamnalalji being officiating Chairman of the Council, the process I suggest in my capacity as President is that anything that is required to be done should first receive the approval of Jamnalalji as if he was legally the officiating Chairman and then his decision should be submitted to me for formal and final approval.
('38', 491, 7, 15, 985035) That will save me from my having to critically examine the merits of each matter.
('38', 491, 7, 16, 985117) With reference to the ten thousand rupees supplied to the Maharashtra Agency in anticipation of sanction, I entirely approve.
('38', 491, 7, 17, 985243) And so do I approve the proposal to pay the Karnatak Agency the collections already made by me at Nipani, Belgaum and elsewhere.
('38', 491, 7, 18, 985372) I think it is quite the proper thing to hold a meeting of the Council in Bangalore at the time of the forthcoming Exhibition or earlier, whichever date may suit you, Jamnalalji and others.
('38', 491, 7, 19, 985561) I descend to Bangalore on Sunday.
('38', 491, 7, 20, 985595) I understand that there is very ample accommodation in the State House placed at my disposal.

('38', 492, 3, 5, 985837) DEAR DOCTOR, Your letters are always interesting and instructive.
('38', 492, 3, 6, 985903) Do I gather that you would prefer my giving up wheat meal or oatmeal, salt, soda and vegetables altogether and confine myself to milk, water and fruit?
('38', 492, 3, 7, 986055) Am I right in thinking that you consider raw milk better than boiled milk?
('38', 492, 3, 8, 986130) Yes, I well remember your talk about sterile eggs and their culture.
('38', 492, 3, 9, 986199) I shall enquire here myself; but if you have any literature on the subject, I would like to study it.
('38', 492, 3, 10, 986301) Without further consideration I am prepared to say that I would put sterile eggs, as you have described them to be, under the same category as milk.
('38', 492, 3, 11, 986450) I am therefore open to receive further instruction about them and their culture.
('38', 492, 3, 12, 986531) You must some day try to convince me about the value of astrology; for, I do not deny the possibility of its being a true science.
('38', 492, 3, 13, 986662) But I do not regard the investigation and use of every science as beneficial to mankind.
('38', 492, 3, 14, 986751) Yours sincerely,

('38', 492, 5, 16, 986797) 494. LETTER TO GANGUBEHN June 3, 1927 Brahmacharya, etc., can be practised only by an inner urge and by cultivating spiritual energy.
('38', 492, 5, 17, 986931) This energy again can only be cultivated by constant application.
('38', 492, 5, 18, 986997) There are two means of such application.
('38', 492, 5, 19, 987038) One, discriminating and meditative study of good books, and two, efforts to practise the noble principles one has learnt.
('38', 492, 5, 20, 987160) Learning without practice goes waste and serves only to turn ones head.
('38', 492, 5, 21, 987232) Whatever therefore one has learnt one should immediately reduce to action.
('38', 492, 5, 22, 987307) Therefore, a woman wanting to practise brahma charya should take to non violence, truth, non possession, etc.
('38', 492, 5, 23, 987417) She should thus zealously guard herself against the slightest untruth, against violence in thought, word or deed and should strive to give up all possessions.
('38', 492, 5, 24, 987576) The scriptures tell us that courage and contentment are also to be cultivated.
('38', 492, 5, 25, 987655) Courage should mean both inward and outward courage and it should be practised as soon as its implications are
('38', 493, 0, 1, 987766) 494 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 493, 1, 2, 987808) clearly understood.
('38', 493, 1, 3, 987828) So is the case with contentment.
('38', 493, 1, 4, 987861) We should not be upset if someone abuses us, maligns us or calls us fools.
('38', 493, 1, 5, 987936) This is a sign of contentment.
('38', 493, 1, 6, 987967) We should remain contented even if we do not get food when hungry or we do not get clothes when we shiver.
('38', 493, 1, 7, 988074) And as long as we do not practise what we have learnt we should not take a new lesson.
('38', 493, 1, 8, 988161) We must apply ourselves to a greater understanding of what we have learnt, and think of nothing else.
('38', 493, 1, 9, 988263) This also is a part of the dharma of brahmacharya because the latter is the high watermark of discipline.

('38', 493, 3, 13, 988451) 495. LETTER TO S. D. SATAVALEKAR June 3, 1927 I have almost finished reading the current issue of Vaidika Dharma.
('38', 493, 3, 14, 988565) I wish to make some comments about the article on brahmacharya in the issue.
('38', 493, 3, 15, 988642) You have interpreted brahmacharya only as preservation of the vital fluid and mentioned manly pursuits like hunting and so on in that context.
('38', 493, 3, 16, 988785) Visiting foreign lands and founding colonies have also been mentioned.
('38', 493, 3, 17, 988856) In my humble view this involves unsound logic.
('38', 493, 3, 18, 988903) The first fallacy consists of narrow definition.
('38', 493, 3, 19, 988952) The brahmacharya which you have explained by first quoting a mantra from the Atharva Veda, viz., the gods overcame death by the strength of brahmacharya, and by practising it man also can overcome death, cannot be restricted to mere preservation of the vital fluid.
('38', 493, 3, 20, 989218) The other is the fallacy of too wide definition.
('38', 493, 3, 21, 989267) Brahmacharya need not be associated with acts of valour, etc.
('38', 493, 3, 22, 989329) We see this in the world today.
('38', 493, 3, 23, 989361) If the mere preservation of semen is the object of brahmacharya, it can be attained, as I have said in one of my letters, in a few minutes by a surgical operation.
('38', 493, 3, 24, 989525) This operation does not make a man impotent; but allows him to indulge in sexual pleasures without losing his vital fluid.
('38', 493, 3, 25, 989648) Such a man does not lose by way of manly adventures either.
('38', 493, 3, 26, 989708) I am sure, however, that you will not call this brahmacharya.
('38', 493, 3, 27, 989770) The brahmacharya which you seek is attainable only by the subjugation of sexual and other desires.
('38', 493, 3, 28, 989869) The preservation of the vital fluid, although important, is only a bye product.
('38', 493, 3, 29, 989949) Its direct and primary objective is nothing less than communion with the Brahman.
('38', 493, 3, 30, 990031) This is the only desirable and legitimate adventure on the path of
('38', 494, 0, 1, 990098) VOL. 38 : 2 JANUARY, 1927 3 JUNE, 1927 495
('38', 494, 1, 2, 990141) brahmacharya.
('38', 494, 1, 3, 990155) Why should a man take to the uphill task of conquering desires for the sake of brahmacharya, when manly adventures like vanquishing the enemy or undertaking foreign expeditions can be achieved by thousands of people without practising brahmacharya?
('38', 494, 1, 4, 990404) And nobody does it, as I can vouchsafe from my fairly wide experience.
('38', 494, 1, 5, 990475) Where can we find braver warriors than the German and the English soldiers?
('38', 494, 1, 6, 990551) They are regularly provided with prostitutes.
('38', 494, 1, 7, 990597) Hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent girls are sacrificed to the sexual hunger of these soldiers.
('38', 494, 1, 8, 990698) No one despises these brave Kshatriyas who defend the country; on the other hand, educated and civilized men and women dote on these soldiers.
('38', 494, 1, 9, 990841) I am not employing epithets like Kshatriyas, etc., on my own or to explain my meaning.
('38', 494, 1, 10, 990928) In my view they are no warriors at all.
('38', 494, 1, 11, 990968) I do not consider them defenders of the country.
('38', 494, 1, 12, 991017) Dharma declines when we sing praises of these men.
('38', 494, 1, 13, 991068) But under modern civilization there is nothing but praise for these people.
('38', 494, 1, 14, 991144) Now let us come to the Indian scene.
('38', 494, 1, 15, 991181) Pathans, Sikhs and Gorkhas are the three acknowledged martial races.
('38', 494, 1, 16, 991250) There is a similar provision of prostitutes for them as in the case of the German and other soldiers.
('38', 494, 1, 17, 991352) They have an honoured place, you know, in the Empire.
('38', 494, 1, 18, 991406) If you look at the ancient lores, adultery has been tolerated in the case of Kshatriyas.
('38', 494, 1, 19, 991495) I write all this because I wish that the people should derive full benefit from your profound studies of the Vedas and other ancient scriptures.
('38', 494, 1, 20, 991640) This will be possible by putting the scriptures in the crucible of modern conditions, by objective observation and intense churning.
('38', 494, 1, 21, 991773) I can write a lot on this subject, but this should do to indicate to you the burden of my theme.
('38', 494, 1, 22, 991870) Another reason for my brevity is that I have little energy.
('38', 494, 1, 23, 991930) I have great respect for your learning and truthfulness, which has impelled me r`to write so much.

('38', 495, 3, 4, 992222) DEAR COMRADE GANDHI,
('38', 495, 4, 5, 992243) We are both erratic enough to permit each other to be rude in order to freely express oneself correctly instead of getting lost in artificiality of phraseology....
('38', 495, 5, 6, 992407) During my conversation with you at certain periods you did not seem to take a definite attitude with regard to the value of organization of labour and peasants.
('38', 495, 5, 7, 992568) You emphatically argued that the charkha movement was making organization.
('38', 495, 5, 8, 992643) I emphatically deny it....
('38', 495, 5, 9, 992670) For centuries together, millions of men and women in India have been boiling rice, utilizing similar quantities of rice and water and conducting cooking operations....
('38', 495, 5, 10, 992838) All these operations surely have not produced any organization and the work of spinning can never do so any more than the work of cooking....
('38', 495, 6, 11, 992980) Before 1900, leaders who .
('38', 495, 6, 12, 993007) worked to build up hopes of salvation .
('38', 495, 6, 13, 993047) were popular leaders as Gladstone was to the British, Bismarck to the Germans, or Parnell to the Irish or Dadabhai or Pherozeshah and Surendranath to the Indians.
('38', 495, 6, 14, 993210) By the year 1900 the masses of men got tired and sick and their hearts began to burn with fire.
('38', 495, 6, 15, 993306) The change came on very rapidly and universally and only such individuals as expressed the burning fire of the heart and the revolt of the suffering human beings were taken as leaders.
('38', 495, 6, 16, 993491) The first task of these was to express boldly and fearlessly the unexpressed voice of the people.
('38', 495, 6, 17, 993589) The second task of these leaders was .
('38', 495, 6, 18, 993628) to make it absolutely impossible for the old order to continue to function.
('38', 495, 6, 19, 993704) The third task was to reconstruct and arduously and slowly to build up a new life.
('38', 495, 6, 20, 993787) Ireland produced a De Valera.
('38', 495, 6, 21, 993817) He did No.
('38', 495, 6, 22, 993828) I and 2 and his people are now bravely carrying on his task No.
('38', 495, 6, 23, 993892) 3. Russia has produced Lenin.
('38', 495, 6, 24, 993922) He did No.
('38', 495, 6, 25, 993933) 1 and 2 and though his life was short, he led his people on the right path regarding No.
('38', 495, 6, 26, 994022) 3. Turkey produced Kemal.
('38', 495, 6, 27, 994048) He did No.
('38', 495, 6, 28, 994059) I and 2 and is fortunate enough to be kicking and vigorous to carry on his task No.
('38', 495, 6, 29, 994143) 3. China produced Sun Yat Sen.
('38', 495, 6, 30, 994174) He completed No.
('38', 495, 6, 31, 994191) I and 2 and after his death his well organized and well disciplined followers are carrying on task No.
('38', 495, 6, 32, 994294) 3. In Italy, though in contrary direction, Mussolini plays the same individual part, India at that moment announced to the world her leader to be Gandhi.
('38', 495, 6, 33, 994448) You performed No.
('38', 495, 6, 34, 994466) 1 but you abandoned task No.
('38', 495, 6, 35, 994495) 2 and so task No.
('38', 495, 6, 36, 994513) 3 is out of the question and we are so overwhelmed with the disastrous defect at the second stage of your struggle that our lot today is harder than before.
('38', 495, 7, 37, 994670) You have created an influence over our countrymen in the lowest strata of society wider and deeper than anybody else.
('38', 495, 7, 38, 994788) However, what is your real object?
('38', 495, 7, 39, 994823) If your purpose is to give your share in the national and political work, your approach to the people should be on terms of absolute equality and your task must be to inspire

('38', 496, 1, 2, 995041) confidence into them.
('38', 496, 1, 3, 995063) From this point of view you must stop allowing people to address you as a Mahatma.
('38', 496, 2, 4, 995146) Then there is one thing that I witnessed at Yeotmeal which has hurt me greatly and I had some slight evidence of it before.
('38', 496, 2, 5, 995270) Your work regarding the removal of untouchability is grand in its aspiration and is not bad in its success as it is generally carried on.
('38', 496, 2, 6, 995408) However I strongly object to your permitting my countrymen and countrywomen to touch your feet and put their fingers to their eyes.
('38', 496, 2, 7, 995540) Such touchability appears to be more damnable than untouchability.
('38', 496, 2, 8, 995607) You are ruining the mentality and the psychology of these villagers for another generation or two.
('38', 496, 2, 9, 995706) You are preparing the country not for mass civil disobedience but for servile obedience and for a belief that there are superior persons on earth and Mahatmas in this life at a time when in this country the white mans prestige is already a dangerous obstacle in our way.
('38', 496, 2, 10, 995977) Politically this career of yours is ruinous and from a humanitarian point of view its degenerating influence appears to me to be a moral plague....
('38', 496, 3, 11, 996125) What I want of you is that you be a good old Gandhi, put an ordinary pair of khaddar trousers and coat and come out and work with us in the ordinary way.
('38', 496, 3, 12, 996279) Come and organize with us (as you alone by yourself have failed) our workers, our peasants and our youths, not with a metaphysical sentimentality but with a set purpose a clear cut and well defined object and by methods such as by experiment are making success for all human beings.
('38', 496, 4, 13, 996562) Therefore before I go, I should like you to get up one morning as from a dream and to say Yes and many of us can soon be put together in a good team and set about putting an end to so many deplorable conditions of life in India about which none of us has any doubt.

('38', 496, 9, 20, 997494) The Trustees shall select such agencies of the Hindu Mahasabha, Sanatan Dharma Sabha and the Arya Samaj, including the Bharatiya Shuddhi Sabha and the Dalitoddhar Sabha of Delhi to carry out the objects of the Trust as they may consider fit from time to time, subject to such general conditions for the submission and audit

('38', 497, 1, 2, 997860) of accounts as they may lay down; but the work of sangathan shall be carried out through the Hindu Mahasabha alone.
('38', 497, 1, 3, 997976) The interest of the five lakhs of the permanent fund will also be spent on the three objects named above in the proportion stated.
('38', 497, 1, 4, 998107) It has also been decided that at least half the total amount raised in a province shall be spent within that province, and this applies to the interest of the permanent endowment fund also.
('38', 497, 1, 5, 998297) It has been also resolved that steps be taken to acquire the house in which Swami Shraddhanandji was murdered with the object of converting it into Swami Shraddhanand Memorial Bhavan.
('38', 497, 1, 6, 998481) Every donor is free to earmark his donation for any of the purposes named above.
('38', 497, 1, 7, 998562) The donations will be strictly used for that purpose or purposes only for which a donor has given it.
('38', 497, 1, 8, 998664) All donations should be remitted to the Manager, The Punjab National Bank Ltd., Delhi, to be credited to the Shraddhanand Memorial Fund.
('38', 497, 1, 9, 998801) When remitting money, remitters are requested to send to the Bank a complete statement of the names and addresses of donors, and the amounts subscribed by each donor and also his instructions, if any.
('38', 497, 1, 10, 999002) They are also requested to send a copy of such statements to the Secretary, Shraddhanand Memorial Fund, Delhi.
('38', 497, 1, 11, 999113) To ensure that all subscriptions are duly credited to the Fund, a formal receipt for the amount subscribed will be sent to the donors by the Secretary, Shraddhanand Memorial Fund.
('38', 497, 1, 12, 999293) If such a receipt is not received by a donor within fifteen days of payment, it is requested that the donor should inform the Secretary of the fact.
('38', 497, 1, 13, 999442) We owe it to the memory of the revered Swamiji that the sum of ten lakhs for which the appeal has been issued by the Hindu Mahasabha, should be fully subscribed at the latest by the 30th of April next,
('38', 497, 2, 14, 999644) We are of opinion that all efforts should be concentrated on raising the All India Memorial and that all movements for local or sectional memorials should be deferred until the All India Memorial Fund is fully subscribed.
('38', 497, 3, 15, 999866) The division of the Fund into three parts enables everyone to make his own choice and contribute freely to the object he may have most at heart.
('38', 497, 3, 16, 1000011) It is to be hoped that the subscribers will bear in mind the date before which the memorial committee expects to finish the collections.

('38', 498, 9, 13, 1001198) Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground, The emptiness of ages in his face, And on his back the burden of the world.
('38', 498, 9, 14, 1001354) Who made him dead to rapture and despair, A thing that grieves not and that never hopes, Staid and stunned, a brother to the Ox?
('38', 498, 9, 15, 1001483) Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?
('38', 498, 9, 16, 1001526) Whose was the hand that slanted back his brow, Whose breath blew out the light within his brain?
('38', 498, 10, 17, 1001623) Oh, masters, lords and rulers in all lands, Is this the handiwork you give to God, This monstrous thing distorted and soul quenched?
('38', 498, 10, 18, 1001756) How will you ever straighten up this shape, Touch it again with immortality, Give it the upward looking and the light: Rebuild in it the music and the dream?

('38', 498, 13, 22, 1001963) FROM THE PREFACE TO BAPUS LETTERS TO MIRA
('38', 498, 14, 23, 1002005) In order that the reader may have a clearer background, I will explain briefly the outline of events in my life which led me to Bapu.
('38', 498, 14, 24, 1002139) Having been brought up in an English country home, I was familiar with rural life, besides which there was, inherent in me from the beginning, a profound love of Nature.
('38', 498, 14, 25, 1002309) At the age of 15, I first
('38', 499, 0, 1, 1002335) 500 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('38', 499, 1, 2, 1002377) heard the music of Beethoven.
('38', 499, 1, 3, 1002407) Forthwith my spirit within was awakened to a living sense of the Divine Power, and prayer to God became a reality.
('38', 499, 1, 4, 1002522) Through Beethovens music I was led to Romain Rolland, and through Romain Rolland to Bapu.
('38', 499, 1, 5, 1002612) These were not just easy stages.
('38', 499, 1, 6, 1002645) On the contrary, turmoil, darkness, hope, despairall had to be passed through before the pure Light of Truth broke in upon my troubled soul and led me to my destination.
('38', 499, 1, 7, 1002815) All along a power was impelling me.
('38', 499, 1, 8, 1002851) I did not understand it for a long while, but, by the time I came to know of Romain Rolland, this force was becoming apparent to me, and from the time of our first meetings at Villeneuve, an extraordinary sense of mellow happiness possessed me.
('38', 499, 1, 9, 1003096) I felt something was coming.
('38', 499, 1, 10, 1003125) I had not the slightest idea what.
('38', 499, 1, 11, 1003160) I only knew that all would be well.
('38', 499, 1, 12, 1003196) Even when Romain Rolland talked to me about Bapu, and said a little book he had written about him was in the Press, I did not realize more than that I must read the book.
('38', 499, 1, 13, 1003367) Then the day came when the book was published.
('38', 499, 1, 14, 1003414) I went to the publishers shop in the Latin Quarter of Paris, where I was then staying.
('38', 499, 1, 15, 1003501) The whole shop window was full of a little book with an orange coloured cover on which was printed in black Mahatma Gandhi.
('38', 499, 1, 16, 1003625) I bought a copy, took my lodging and began to read.
('38', 499, 1, 17, 1003677) I could not put it down.
('38', 499, 1, 18, 1003702) I read and read, and as I read the dawn in my heart glowed brighter and brighter, and by the time I had finished, the Sun of Truth was pouring his rays into my soul.
('38', 499, 1, 19, 1003868) From that moment I knew that my life was dedicated to Bapu.
('38', 499, 1, 20, 1003928) That for which I had been waiting had come, and it was this.
('38', 499, 1, 21, 1003989) I straightaway went to London and booked a passage to India at the P. & O. office.
('38', 499, 1, 22, 1004072) I also sought out and devoured all the literature I could; writings of Bapu, writings of Tagore, English and French translations of the Bhagavad Gita; and even the Upanishads and Vedas I peeped into.
('38', 499, 1, 23, 1004272) But very soon I began to realize that I was a fool to think that I could rush to Bapu like this.
('38', 499, 1, 24, 1004369) I was wholly unfit spiritually and physically, and I must first put myself through a severe training.
('38', 499, 1, 25, 1004471) I accordingly went back to the P. & O. office and changed my reserved berth for one a year later.
('38', 499, 2, 26, 1004569) I now set about things in a thorough and systematic way.
('38', 499, 2, 27, 1004626) First I studied the rules and regulations of the Sabarmati Ashram in every detail.
('38', 499, 2, 28, 1004709) Then I began changing my diet item by item, until I reached pure vegetarian food.
('38', 499, 2, 29, 1004791) I started sitting cross legged on the floor.
('38', 499, 2, 30, 1004836) Ten minutes at a stretch was all I could do in the beginning, but with steady practice I became perfectly at ease.
('38', 499, 2, 31, 1004951) I commenced lessons in Urdu and of course learnt carding, spinning and weaving.
('38', 499, 2, 32, 1005031) This had to be in wool, but gave me good practice.
('38', 499, 2, 33, 1005082) At the same time study of the literature continued.
('38', 499, 2, 34, 1005134) In the midst of this training news came in the papers that Bapu had gone on a 21 days fast for Hindu Muslim unity.
('38', 499, 2, 35, 1005249) As the days went by, the papers began saying that Bapu would probably not survive.
('38', 499, 2, 36, 1005332) I prayed to God in anguish.
('38', 499, 2, 37, 1005360) The days dragged on.
('38', 499, 2, 38, 1005381) But I never slackened in my training because, even if Bapu were to pass away in his physical form, I knew I must go to India to serve his cause.
('38', 499, 2, 39, 1005526) It seemed an eternity, but at last the 21 days were over and the news came that the fast had been safely broken.
('38', 499, 2, 40, 1005639) Up to now I had not written a word to Bapu.
('38', 499, 2, 41, 1005683) But on the successful completion of the fast, my heart was so full of thankful joy that I just had to write.
