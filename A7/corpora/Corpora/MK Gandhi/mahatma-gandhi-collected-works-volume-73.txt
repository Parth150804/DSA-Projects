('73', 0, 2, 3, 78) February 21, 1938 You may settle down there if Vidya keeps well and you have good work.
('73', 0, 2, 4, 166) Father you should forget.
('73', 0, 2, 5, 192) Not to do so is to irritate the boil.

('73', 0, 5, 9, 338) 2. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 2
('73', 0, 6, 10, 366) February 23, 1938 I have read the Governor Generals statement 3 with the respect and attention it deserves.
('73', 0, 6, 11, 474) I had hoped that it would give some satis faction, as was given at least to me and, if I may say so, a large number of Congressmen when he made a pronouncement upon the Congress demand for certain assurances as a condition precedent to the accep tance of ministerial responsibility by Congress members of the pro vincial Legislatures.
('73', 0, 6, 12, 809) It reads like a special pleading unworthy of a personage possessing unheard of powers.
('73', 0, 6, 13, 896) No one has questioned the propriety of examining the cases of prisoners to be discharged; but what I have questioned, and the Con gress most emphatically questions, is the propriety of such exami nation by provincial Governors in provinces said to be enjoying com plete provincial autonomy.
('73', 0, 6, 14, 1187) That duty and the right of examination belong solely to responsible Ministers as I understand the Government of India Act and the convention in responsibly governed Colonies.
('73', 0, 6, 15, 1362) The Governors duty and right are to advise their Ministers on the question of broad policy and warn them of danger in their exercise of certain powers, but having done so to leave their Ministers free to exercise their unfettered judgment.
('73', 0, 6, 16, 1602) If such were not the case, the responsibility would become a perfectly meaningless term, and the Ministers responsible to their electors would have as their share
('73', 0, 7, 17, 1765) 1 The addressee had consulted Gandhiji in connection with his stay at Nainital and his relations with his father.

('73', 1, 0, 1, 1958) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 1, 1, 2, 1998) nothing but odium and disgrace, if their responsibility had to be shared with Governors in the daily administration of affairs by law entrusted to them.
('73', 1, 1, 3, 2151) It is hardly graceful for His Excellency to quote against the poor Ministers their non exercise of their undoubted powers to prevent Governors from examining individual cases.
('73', 1, 1, 4, 2327) The Congress Resolution 1 describes their forbearance as exemplary patience.
('73', 1, 1, 5, 2404) I would venture to add that probably it was also the inexperi ence of the Ministers who were totally new to their task.
('73', 1, 1, 6, 2524) I am afraid, therefore, that unless this crucial question is decided in favour of the Ministers, it will be difficult for them to shoulder the grave responsi bility that the Congress has permitted them to take over.
('73', 1, 1, 7, 2740) I am glad that His Excellency has drawn public attention to the method I adopted in Bengal.
('73', 1, 1, 8, 2832) He might have noted also the difference between Bengal on the one hand and the U.P. and Bihar on the other.
('73', 1, 1, 9, 2940) In Bengal I was dealing with a Government which was not bound by the Congress manifesto in any shape or form.
('73', 1, 1, 10, 3050) The Ministers there rightly or wrongly would not listen to a wholesale discharge of convi cted prisoners.
('73', 1, 1, 11, 3156) I was treading upon very delicate ground in pursuance of my promise to the prisoners.
('73', 1, 1, 12, 3242) My motive was purely humanitarian, and the only weapon that I had at my disposal was an appeal to the human in the Bengal Ministers.
('73', 1, 1, 13, 3375) And I am glad to be able to testify that I was not speaking to hearts of stone.
('73', 1, 1, 14, 3455) The situation in the U. P. and Bihar is totally different.
('73', 1, 1, 15, 3514) The Ministers there are bound by the manifesto which gave them victory at the polls.
('73', 1, 1, 16, 3599) They had not only examined the cases of all prisoners whose release they were seeking but, being fully aware of their responsibility for the due preservation of peace in their provinces, had personally secured assurances from the prisoners in question that they no longer believed in the cult of violence.
('73', 1, 1, 17, 3905) One thing in His Excellencys statement gives me hope that the impending crisis might be prevented.
('73', 1, 1, 18, 4004) He has still left the door open for negotiations between the Governors and the Ministers.
('73', 1, 1, 19, 4094) I recognize that the notices were sudden, because in the nature of things they had to be so.
('73', 1, 1, 20, 4187) 2 All the parties have now had ample time for considering the
('73', 1, 2, 21, 4249) 1 Vide Resolution on Ministerial Resignations, 18 2 1938
('73', 1, 3, 22, 4306) 2 The Viceregal statement read: In the case of Bihar the demand was received by the Governor at 1 p.
('73', 1, 3, 23, 4407) and cabled for action by the Chief Secretary by 4 p.
('73', 1, 3, 24, 4460) the same day.
('73', 1, 3, 25, 4474) In the case of the United Provinces the time limit set for compliance was also brief to a degree.

('73', 2, 1, 2, 4620) situation.
('73', 2, 1, 3, 4631) In my opinion the crisis can be avoided if the Governors are left free to give an assurance that their examination of cases was not intended to be usurpation of the powers of the Ministers, and that since they had armed themselves with assurances from prisoners they were free to release them on their own responsibility.
('73', 2, 1, 4, 4953) And I hope that the Working Committee will leave the Ministers free, if they are sum moned by the Governors; to judge for themselves whether they are satisfied by the assurances they may receive.
('73', 2, 1, 5, 5149) One thing I must say in connection with the exercise by His Excellency of his powers under Section 126 (5) in the light of his argument justifying the use of sub section 5 of Section 126. I have read the whole of it.
('73', 2, 1, 6, 5366) It is entitled Control of the Federation over Provinces in Certain Cases.
('73', 2, 1, 7, 5440) Unless the sub sections have no conne ction with one another and they are to be read independently of one another, my reading is that in the present case the exercise of powers under sub section 5 of Section 126 is a manifest misapplication.
('73', 2, 1, 8, 5682) But here I am treading on dangerous ground.
('73', 2, 1, 9, 5726) Let lawyers decide the point.
('73', 2, 1, 10, 5756) My purpose in making this long statement is to assist a peaceful solution of the crisis that has suddenly appeared.

('73', 3, 4, 5, 6610) WARDHA, SEGAON, February 24, 1938
('73', 3, 5, 6, 6644) DEAR DR.
('73', 3, 5, 7, 6653) HARDIKAR, I retain the same view that I held in 1920 as to volunteers.
('73', 3, 5, 8, 6724) You know that at Ahmedabad the Congress had passed a resolution 1
('73', 3, 6, 9, 6790) embodying a pledge for volunteers and certain instructions to be followed by them.
('73', 3, 6, 10, 6873) Experience has proved for me the correctness of the position I then took.
('73', 3, 6, 11, 6947) It is true that there has not been the response that I wanted.
('73', 3, 6, 12, 7010) The causes of the inadequacy of response I need not go into at the present moment.
('73', 3, 6, 13, 7093) Our volunteers for me are, and should be, our non violent army, irresistible and invincible.
('73', 3, 6, 14, 7186) Therefore I would expect every adult person to undergo a practical volunteer training for at least three months.
('73', 3, 6, 15, 7299) I would expect them to give at least one month every year to practical service.
('73', 3, 6, 16, 7379) Now that in seven provinces the Congress runs the Government the thing should be easy.
('73', 3, 6, 17, 7466) The first thing, therefore, is to prepare a textbook, giving in minute detail the course of instructions to be imparted to candidate volunteers and then begin the work of instruction not in cities but in villages.
('73', 3, 6, 18, 7680) I would concentrate all effort on villiages.
('73', 3, 6, 19, 7725) Whilst I note the marvellous mass awakening that has taken place, I am painfully conscious of the fact that a far greater and a far more solid awakening has to take place before we can confidently say that swaraj is ours for the asking.
('73', 3, 6, 20, 7962) Any extraneous event may put power into our hands.
('73', 3, 6, 21, 8013) I would not call that swaraj of the people.
('73', 3, 6, 22, 8057) If what I have said appeals to your head and to your heart, you should show this letter to Jawaharlal and if he approves, and only if he approves, you should take the next step.
('73', 3, 6, 23, 8235) I say this with deliberation.
('73', 3, 6, 24, 8265) I do not want to take a new step in life of a political nature unless I can secure his approval and co operation.
('73', 3, 6, 25, 8379) Secondly, there is not that meeting of our hearts which is necessary for me to give guidance.

('73', 4, 1, 3, 8600) I know that there is no such barrier between you and Jawaharlal.
('73', 4, 1, 4, 8665) Therefore even though I may say something which appeals to your head and heart, in my opinion I should have Jawaharlals hearty endorsement before you take any step on the strength of what I say.
('73', 4, 1, 5, 8860) I hope you are now keeping perfect health.

('73', 4, 5, 11, 9053) DEAR MR. JINNAH, I thank you for your letter.
('73', 4, 5, 12, 9099) I have read your letter to Jawaharlal also.
('73', 4, 5, 13, 9143) I observe that both the letters invite, not written replies but a personal discussion.
('73', 4, 5, 14, 9230) I do not know whether it will take place in the first instance between you and Jawaharlal or, now that Subhas Bose succeeds him, between you and the latter.
('73', 4, 5, 15, 9387) If you desire that before this there should be a talk between you and me, I would be delighted to see you in Segaon any time which is convenient to you before the 10th of March after which, if health permits, I might have to go to Bengal.
('73', 4, 5, 16, 9626) So far as I am concerned, just as on the Hindu Muslim question I was guided by Dr. Ansari, now that he is no more in our midst, I have accepted Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as my guide.
('73', 4, 5, 17, 9807) My suggestion, therefore, to you is that conversation should be opened in the first instance as between you and Maulana Saheb.
('73', 4, 5, 18, 9934) But in every case regard me as at your disposal.

('73', 5, 3, 8, 10374) You should definitely stay on if your health can really improve.
('73', 5, 3, 9, 10439) I am likely to go that side in April.

('73', 5, 3, 13, 10601) I have already written 1 to you that I had a long chat with Shakaribehn.
('73', 5, 3, 14, 10674) The whole of last night I dreamt about you.
('73', 5, 3, 15, 10718) With great impatience and restlessness you said: Now please do get me married. You even showed me the man.
('73', 5, 3, 16, 10825) I did not know him, nor his name.

('73', 6, 5, 7, 11858) [March 4, 1938] 4
('73', 6, 6, 8, 11876) Three representatives of the Scindia Steam Navigation Company had an interview with Gandhiji at Segaon....
('73', 6, 6, 9, 11983) They seemed to be worried by the following among a number of things:
('73', 6, 7, 10, 12052) (1) The discrimination clauses.
('73', 6, 7, 11, 12084) 5 They cited from Gandhijis article in Young India entitled The Giant and the Dwarf 6 the following statements:
('73', 6, 8, 12, 12196) To talk of no discrimination between Indian interests and English or European is to perpetuate Indian helotage.
('73', 6, 8, 13, 12308) What is equality of rights between a giant and a dwarf?
('73', 6, 8, 14, 12364) . And again: In almost every walk of life the Englishman by reason of his belonging to the ruling class occupies a privileged position....
('73', 6, 8, 15, 12503) The cottage industries of India had to perish in order that Lancashire might flourish.
('73', 6, 8, 16, 12590) The Indian shipping had to perish, so that British shipping might flourish.
('73', 6, 9, 17, 12666) Is the shipping not to revive and rise to its full height in a free India?
('73', 6, 10, 18, 12741) (2) What are Indian or swadeshi companies?
('73', 6, 10, 19, 12784) It has become a fashion nowadays to bamboozle the unwary public by adding (India) Limited to full blooded British concerns.
('73', 6, 10, 20, 12908) Lever Brothers (India) Limited have their factories here now.
('73', 6, 10, 21, 12970) They claim to produce swadeshi soap, and have already ruined several large and small soap factories in Bengal.
('73', 6, 10, 22, 13081) Then there is the Imperial Chemicals (India) Ltd.
('73', 6, 10, 23, 13131) which has received valuable concessions.
('73', 6, 10, 24, 13172) This is dumping foreign industries instead of foreign

('73', 7, 2, 3, 13821) (3) Then there are companies with Indian Directorate with British Managing Agents who direct the Directorate.
('73', 7, 2, 4, 13931) Would you call a company with a large percentage of Indian capital and a large number of Indian Directors on the Board, but with a non Indian Managing Director or non lndian firm as Managing Agents, a swadeshi concern?
('73', 7, 3, 5, 14150) Gandhiji dealt with these points fairly exhaustively in his reply which may be summarized below in his own words: (1) On this point I am glad you have reminded me of my article written in 1931. I still hold the same views, and have no doubt that a free India will have the right to discriminateif that word must be usedagainst foreign interests, wherever Indian interests need it.
('73', 7, 3, 6, 14531) (2) As regards the definition of a swadeshi company I would say that only those concerns can be regarded as swadeshi whose control, direction and management either by a Managing Director or by Managing Agents are in Indian hands.
('73', 7, 3, 7, 14761) I should have no objection to the use of foreign capital, or to the employment of foreign talent, when such are not available in India, or when we need them, but only on condition that such capital and such talents are exclusively under the control, direction and management of Indians and are used in the interests of India.
('73', 7, 3, 8, 15087) But the use of foreign capital or talent is one thing, and the dumping of foreign industrial concerns is totally another thing.
('73', 7, 3, 9, 15215) The concerns you have named cannot in the remotest sense of the term be called swadeshi.
('73', 7, 3, 10, 15304) Rather than countenance these ventures, I would prefer the development of the industries in question to be delayed by a few years in order to permit national capital and enterprise to grow up and build such industries in future under the actual control, direc tion and management of Indians themselves.
('73', 7, 3, 11, 15607) (3) Answer to this is contained in my answer on the second point.

('73', 8, 2, 3, 15765) [Before March 5, 1938] [GANDHIJI:] The States resolution 2 is a call to the States people not to go to sleep but to start work in right earnest.
('73', 8, 2, 4, 15910) The Congress is deeply concerned about the welfare of Indian States, as the Congress resolution 3 on the Federation should clearly show.
('73', 8, 2, 5, 16047) We want the States people to carry on ceaseless work in the States, but not in the name of the Congress.
('73', 8, 2, 6, 16152) The use of the name of the Congress may expose the Congress to insult.
('73', 8, 2, 7, 16223) If insult could result in good to the States people, I would court it.
('73', 8, 2, 8, 16294) But it is far from being so.
('73', 8, 2, 9, 16323) The Congress cannot in the nature of things step into each and every Indian State and protect those who agitate there.
('73', 8, 2, 10, 16442) It is better able to protect them by not allow ing them to use its name.
('73', 8, 2, 11, 16515) If the States people have begun to understand and respect the Congress it is a good thing, but then let them work with the moral support of the Congress but avoid the Congress name.
('73', 8, 2, 12, 16697) Whenever the Congress can effectively help the States people it would do so not by actively meddling with their affairs but by acting as an intermediary.
('73', 8, 2, 13, 16851) Co operation from within the States is an impossible proposition, and therefore I have been deliberately advising the States people to refrain from having Congress Committees within the States.
('73', 8, 2, 14, 17045) Some say: We would end the States. Now this cry does neither these friends nor the Indian States any harm.
('73', 8, 2, 15, 17152) But it would harm them if they were actively interesting them selves in States affairs and trying to work there in the Congress name.
('73', 8, 2, 16, 17286) The prestige of the Congress would suffer and not gain by the use of the Congress name.
('73', 8, 2, 17, 17374) Mysore is a case in point.
('73', 8, 2, 18, 17401) It had a bona fide Congress organization but it could not prevent the Congress flag from being insulted.
('73', 8, 3, 19, 17506) But, said the friend from the States, all these things have happened in British India?
('73', 8, 4, 20, 17593) 1 Reproduced from Mahadev Desais Notes 2 Passed at the Congress session at Haripura 3 Which inter alia read: The Indian States participating in the Federation should approximate to the Provinces in the establishment of representative institutions and responsible government, civil liberties and method of election to the Federal Houses.
('73', 8, 4, 21, 17930) Otherwise the Federation as it is now contemplated will, instead of building up Indian unity, encourage separatist tendencies and involve the States in internal and external conflicts.
('73', 9, 0, 1, 18115) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 9, 1, 2, 18156) They have, and the Congress has always stood up to the insult.
('73', 9, 1, 3, 18219) That is because in British India we can adopt civil disobedience for any good cause, but in the States it is impossible.
('73', 9, 1, 4, 18340) The Congress Committees will have always to be at the mercy of the States and would be in no better case than, for instance, a Committee in Afgha nistan, which would entirely exist on the mercy of the Government of Afghanistan.
('73', 9, 1, 5, 18568) But of course this is my personal view and interpretation.
('73', 9, 1, 6, 18627) When I came to India, I had an offer from three Indian States to settle and carry on my work from there.
('73', 9, 1, 7, 18732) I had to decline the offer.
('73', 9, 2, 8, 18760) But we do not ask for active help from the Congress.
('73', 9, 2, 9, 18813) We want to organize under the aegis of the Congress.
('73', 9, 2, 10, 18866) The onus of helping us would be upon the Congress, but we do not ask for the help.
('73', 9, 2, 11, 18949) There it is, whether you ask for it or not, the onus would be upon the Congress, and it is not able to discharge it.
('73', 9, 2, 12, 19066) Without being able to render any active support, the aegis of the Congress would be a superfluous affair.
('73', 9, 2, 13, 19172) A big organization like the Congress cannot allow itself to be stultified.
('73', 9, 2, 14, 19247) This is all as plain as a pikestaff to me.
('73', 9, 2, 15, 19290) I do not know how the States people fail to understand this.
('73', 9, 2, 16, 19351) The best help that the Congress can render today is to destroy the delusion that it can actively help the Indian States.
('73', 9, 2, 17, 19472) That will automatically mean that the States people must learn to rely on themselves for all internal reforms.
('73', 9, 3, 18, 19583) I understand this very well.
('73', 9, 3, 19, 19612) But look at the resolution as finally passed.
('73', 9, 3, 20, 19658) The new rider that has been added is absurd.
('73', 9, 3, 21, 19703) We are allowed to have Committees in States but they will be allowed to do nothing.
('73', 9, 3, 22, 19787) The position is anomalous.
('73', 9, 3, 23, 19814) It is, I am afraid.
('73', 9, 3, 24, 19834) It was a concession to the States people, but a useless concession in terms of my interpretation.
('73', 9, 4, 25, 19932) Then, what shall be our position?
('73', 9, 4, 26, 19966) Shall we stop enrolling Congress members and begin to organize a separate national organization which will join the Congress under the present restrictions?
('73', 9, 4, 27, 20123) The real job is to build up your own organization.
('73', 9, 4, 28, 20174) But you may continue to be members of the Congress, attend it and keep in touch with it.
('73', 9, 4, 29, 20263) But your real work will lie in the States.
('73', 9, 4, 30, 20306) The resolution is permissive.
('73', 9, 4, 31, 20336) You need not set up a Congress Committee in the States.
('73', 9, 4, 32, 20392) But my advice is of no value.
('73', 9, 4, 33, 20422) You must seek authoritative instructions from the Working Committee

('73', 10, 6, 12, 20825) March 6, [1938] 2
('73', 10, 7, 13, 20843) SUBHAS BOSE: Bapu, may I ask you a question?
('73', 10, 7, 14, 20888) What is the future programme of the Board?
('73', 10, 8, 15, 20931) [GANDHIJI:] The most immediate piece of work before the Board is the preparation of textbooks for teachers.
('73', 10, 8, 16, 21039) Next, the Board must approach the different Congress ministers and chalk out the plan of work for each province, with due consi deration for the present limitations and capacity of work.
('73', 10, 8, 17, 21226) Thirdly, the Board must itself conduct an experimental centre to test the syllabus it has drawn up, and must revise its own recommen dations at every step in the light of the experience thus gained.
('73', 10, 8, 18, 21425) Fourthly, the Board must organize and conduct as many train ing schools as possible.
('73', 10, 8, 19, 21510) Every training school serves a double pur pose.
('73', 10, 8, 20, 21558) It may not only train future teachers, but every training school also means a demonstration school of basic education.
('73', 10, 9, 21, 21677) SUBHAS BOSE: What about the expenses of the Board?
('73', 10, 9, 22, 21728) [G.] We shall have to beg for it.
('73', 10, 9, 23, 21762) I do not think it right to expect any financial contributions from the Congress governments, because that would provide an opportunity for the criticisms of the opposition party.
('73', 10, 10, 24, 21941) SUBHAS BOSE: Bapu, this is as regards the problem of rural basic education.
('73', 10, 10, 25, 22017) What is your suggestion as regards the problem of basic education in urban areas?
('73', 10, 11, 26, 22099) 1 The addressees telegram to Mahadev Desai, to which this telegram is a reply, is dated March 5, 1938. It read ,Joseph sinking.

('73', 11, 0, 1, 22336) 12 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 11, 1, 2, 22377) Some municipalities, e.
('73', 11, 1, 3, 22401) g., the municipalities of Calcutta and Bombay, are doing some work in this direction and would like to extend their work in progressive primary education.
('73', 11, 1, 4, 22556) What is your suggestion as regards the problem of primary education in cities?
('73', 11, 1, 5, 22635) [G.] According to my educational philosophy, there is no fundamental difference between the basic education in a rural and an urban area.
('73', 11, 1, 6, 22773) The aim in both is the samethe development of the intelligence through a vocation.
('73', 11, 1, 7, 22856) The system of training that is evolved for rural areas will also be applicable to urban areas.
('73', 11, 1, 8, 22951) I know from personal experience that the products of primary education in urban areas are good for nothing, but, for the present, I do not wish to divide the energies of the Board.
('73', 11, 1, 9, 23132) If it succeeds in solving the problem of rural education, the other problem will also be solved.
('73', 11, 1, 10, 23229) If ten years of work are devoted to rural education, you may consider that the whole problem of primary education whether rural or urban has been grappled with.
('73', 11, 2, 11, 23390) Subhas Bose next asked whether a representative of a city municipality with some experience of municipal education could not be a member of the Board, so that he could attempt, if he liked, to adapt the findings of the A. I. E. B. for the purpose of urban basic education.
('73', 11, 2, 12, 23663) [G.] Certainly.
('73', 11, 2, 13, 23679) The Board will be a representative body.
('73', 11, 2, 14, 23720) All the members of the Board are representatives of the city.
('73', 11, 2, 15, 23782) Where shall I find real villagers as members?

('73', 13, 1, 3, 25420) If you cannot come to Segaon and my health permits, I will gladly go to Bombay to meet you when you are there.

('73', 14, 12, 18, 27992) [Before March 12, 1938] [GANDHIJI:] For non violence to permeate as we should have a living faith in God.
('73', 14, 12, 19, 28098) Non violence comes to us through doing good continually without the slightest expectation of return.
('73', 14, 12, 20, 28199) It simply spends itself and it is its own reward, and done in that spirit it is done not merely for friends but certainly for adversaries.
('73', 14, 12, 21, 28338) That is the indispensable lesson in non violence.
('73', 14, 12, 22, 28388) It was thrown my way by God in South Africa in an atmosphere which was as adverse as it well could be.
('73', 14, 12, 23, 28491) I was in a country where I knew no European or Indian.
('73', 14, 12, 24, 28546) I had gone there to make a career as a lawyer.
('73', 14, 12, 25, 28593) But I succeeded in learning the eternal law of suffering as the only remedy for undoing wrong and injustice.
('73', 14, 12, 26, 28702) It means positively the law of non violence.
('73', 14, 12, 27, 28747) You have to be prepared to suffer cheerfully at the hands of all and sundry, and you will wish ill to no one, not even to those who may have wronged you.
('73', 14, 12, 28, 28901) Just now a good many people are talking of world peace,
('73', 14, 13, 29, 28957) 1 This is reproduced from Mabadev Desais Notes.
('73', 15, 0, 1, 29005) 16 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 15, 1, 2, 29046) promoting peace societies and passing resolutions.
('73', 15, 1, 3, 29097) This is good as far as it goes.
('73', 15, 1, 4, 29129) But it may not be non violence.
('73', 15, 1, 5, 29161) An army of non violence exposes itself to all the risks that an army of violence does.
('73', 15, 1, 6, 29248) Only the latter expects to retaliate even when it is not the aggressor.
('73', 15, 1, 7, 29320) An army of non violence runs risks without the wish to retaliate.
('73', 15, 2, 8, 29386) [THE PACIFIST:] But the war spirit is creeping slowly over us.
('73', 15, 2, 9, 29449) How are we to combat it?
('73', 15, 2, 10, 29474) I know how difficult it is for you to combat it in England.
('73', 15, 2, 11, 29534) You have to approach the problem with faith and determination even though you may be very few.
('73', 15, 2, 12, 29629) I would recommend the study of Richard Greggs book 1 on the practice of non violence.
('73', 15, 2, 13, 29715) A true pacifist refuses to use the fruit of armspeace and order.
('73', 15, 2, 14, 29780) So long as we eat a single grain of wheat grown under the protection of arms we participate in violence.
('73', 15, 2, 15, 29885) When one realizes this one has to be an exile in ones own country and a rebel.
('73', 15, 2, 16, 29964) But everything has to be done accor ding to the measure of ones strength.
('73', 15, 2, 17, 30038) A few people with the courage of their convictions can become perfect nuisances to the whole State.
('73', 15, 2, 18, 30138) How far it is possible to reduce the whole thing to practice is for each individual to judge.
('73', 15, 3, 19, 30232) Our English movement for peace is growing.
('73', 15, 3, 20, 30275) But shall we simply go on enrolling more and more members?
('73', 15, 3, 21, 30334) I am not enamoured of numbers.
('73', 15, 3, 22, 30365) A peace army does not rely upon numbers unless they understand the implications of non vio lence.
('73', 15, 3, 23, 30463) I would, therefore, concentrate on a few becoming saturated with the spirit of non violence and disciplining themselves for the utmost suffering.
('73', 15, 3, 24, 30609) How exactly to act in particular situations is a matter of waiting on God.
('73', 15, 3, 25, 30684) The answer comes straight in response to prayer from the heart.
('73', 15, 3, 26, 30748) Such prayer carries with it the anguish of the soul.

('73', 16, 1, 3, 31149) As regards A. S., you have swung from one extreme to the other.
('73', 16, 1, 4, 31213) This is violence.
('73', 16, 1, 5, 31231) I can understand your unwillingness to keep up your relations with her.
('73', 16, 1, 6, 31303) But why should it be that you cannot go to any place where she is?
('73', 16, 1, 7, 31370) Why this cowardice?
('73', 16, 1, 8, 31390) I do not see in her the faults that you see.
('73', 16, 1, 9, 31435) She gives me no trouble.
('73', 16, 1, 10, 31460) She has a number of good qualities.
('73', 16, 1, 11, 31496) How can I send her away?
('73', 16, 1, 12, 31521) When asked, Ramachandran told me that he could not see any defect in her.
('73', 16, 1, 13, 31595) You should cultivate patience and generosity.
('73', 16, 1, 14, 31641) She cannot ask me anything about you.
('73', 16, 1, 15, 31679) Nor do I tell her anything.
('73', 16, 1, 16, 31707) That does not mean that she doesnt keep thinking of you.
('73', 16, 1, 17, 31764) Saraswati also seems to live in fear.
('73', 16, 1, 18, 31802) Trust me, be calm and give up your unnatu ralness.
('73', 16, 1, 19, 31853) Do come to Orissa.
('73', 16, 1, 20, 31872) Prabha cannot go there.
('73', 16, 1, 21, 31896) I will explain when we meet.

('73', 18, 7, 12, 34027) Is it all right?
('73', 18, 7, 13, 34044) I had gone through yesterdays articles yesterday itself.
('73', 18, 7, 14, 34101) I have made practically no changes this time in the writings.
('73', 18, 7, 15, 34163) We felt no tremors here.
('73', 18, 7, 16, 34188) The reason may be that our floor is on level with the ground and the walls are of mud.

('73', 19, 1, 2, 34478) 26. A DISCUSSION 1
('73', 19, 2, 3, 34497) [On or before March 15, 1938] 2
('73', 19, 3, 4, 34529) Gandhiji was discussing with a friend and co worker his reactions to the Haripura Congress.
('73', 19, 3, 5, 34621) He said he would make these views known as early as possible for the information and benefit of those who would be responsible for the session in Mahakoshal.
('73', 19, 3, 6, 34779) The Congress is a striking testimony to the great organizing ability of the Sardar and his lieutenants as also his ability to command financial help from moneyed friends.
('73', 19, 3, 7, 34950) But the scale cannot be, must not be, repeated.
('73', 19, 3, 8, 34998) It is wrong to make lavish use of money even when it is plentiful.
('73', 19, 3, 9, 35065) I am partly responsible for the use of electricity and motors and motor lorries.
('73', 19, 3, 10, 35146) For Dev and Dastanes 3 importunity had weakened me at Faizpur.
('73', 19, 3, 11, 35209) Sardars thoroughness showed me the glaring absurdity of the use of these things for a village Congress.
('73', 19, 3, 12, 35313) They made the Congress camp look like a bit of Bombay instead of the multiplied village it should have looked and was intended to look like.
('73', 19, 3, 13, 35454) Classes were retained at Faizpur.
('73', 19, 3, 14, 35488) At Haripura the classification was intensified.
('73', 19, 3, 15, 35536) There were the leaders, ministers, delegates visitors and the villagers.
('73', 19, 3, 16, 35609) The division was not horizontal but vertical.
('73', 19, 3, 17, 35655) The Congress is our political Mecca.
('73', 19, 3, 18, 35692) The annual function is not a tamasha or a fair, but a Haj, a pilgrimage, at which all distinctions as between rich and poor, learned and illiterate, city dweller and villager disap pear.
('73', 19, 3, 19, 35879) Why should Working Committee members have more conveni ences than others?
('73', 19, 3, 20, 35953) Why should they have food other than the villa gers?
('73', 19, 3, 21, 36006) Should a villager eat different food and be differently housed when he becomes a member of the Working Committee?
('73', 19, 3, 22, 36120) Or why should a delegate who happens to be a Minister have a much multi plied hut?
('73', 19, 3, 23, 36203) It is a wholly different thing when one is ill or is used to special food.
('73', 19, 3, 24, 36278) Such persons should make their own arrangements or have them made by the Reception Committee by previous appoint ment.
('73', 19, 3, 25, 36397) Indeed those who have frail bodies should abstainfrom atten dance, unless their presence is urgently required in the interest of the

('73', 20, 1, 2, 36762) Congress.
('73', 20, 1, 3, 36772) Vertical division of the camps into different classes sets a pernicious example to the vast number of villagers who attend the Con gress.
('73', 20, 1, 4, 36910) The Congress management has to go out of its way to show the villagers that before it there is no prince and no pauper and that all are equal.
('73', 20, 1, 5, 37053) If these artificial differences disappear next year, much expense will be saved.
('73', 20, 1, 6, 37134) Electric lights are in no way necessary.
('73', 20, 1, 7, 37175) Visitors should be ex pected to bring their own lanterns.
('73', 20, 1, 8, 37233) The Reception Committee will confine itself to the lighting that may be required for the despatch of Congress work and for the safety of the camp.
('73', 20, 1, 9, 37380) Much work must not be expected to be done after dark.
('73', 20, 1, 10, 37434) Motors and motor lorries are a nuisance, bad education for the villagers, disturbing of peace, a hindrance to the proper despatch of work, and conducive to the raising of dust.
('73', 20, 1, 11, 37611) The distance of ten miles or less from a railway station must be negotiated on foot or in bullock carts.
('73', 20, 1, 12, 37716) None but pedestrian traffic should be permitted inside the camp.
('73', 20, 1, 13, 37781) The site selected for the Congress should be a solid square block as far as possible.
('73', 20, 1, 14, 37867) This will ensure a compact camp avoiding long distance between one end of the camp and the other.
('73', 20, 1, 15, 37965) The layout can be round the quadrangle where the open session is to take place.
('73', 20, 1, 16, 38045) There should be one common kitchen from where food should be served at stated prices per course, not to be eaten on the spot but to be taken to the place of residence of the diner.
('73', 20, 1, 17, 38226) If these precautions are not observed, the whole idea of villagers Congress for their education and for establishing a living and national contact between the city dweller and the villager is likely to be frustrated.

('73', 21, 9, 22, 39500) 1 Following Gandhijis appeal to join the Congress, some members of the Scheduled Castes had asked him how their political and economic interests could be safeguarded if they joined the Congress which was not in power in the Province.

('73', 22, 2, 3, 39832) CALCUTTA, March 19, 1938
('73', 22, 3, 4, 39857) In the course of the discussion the members of the Krishak Party are reported
('73', 22, 4, 5, 39935) to have intimated to Mahatmaji their desire to see the political situation in Bengal
('73', 22, 5, 6, 40020) changed and their readiness to work in co operation with the Congress Party in the
('73', 22, 6, 7, 40103) Legislature if the administration of the Province was run on purely national lines and
('73', 22, 7, 8, 40190) on an economic basis.
('73', 22, 8, 9, 40212) Mahatma Gandhi wanted it to be realized that the main object of his visit to
('73', 22, 9, 10, 40289) Bengal was the release of political prisoners and he would rather not be drawn into
('73', 22, 10, 11, 40373) local politics.
('73', 22, 10, 12, 40389) He, however, informed them that he intended returning to Calcutta by
('73', 22, 11, 13, 40458) the 1st April next from Delang where he would have to attend the annual meeting of
('73', 22, 12, 14, 40541) the Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('73', 22, 12, 15, 40564) He proposed to concentrate all his attention during his
('73', 22, 13, 16, 40620) present trip to Calcutta on tackling the problem of the release of detenus and political
('73', 22, 14, 17, 40709) prisoners.
('73', 22, 14, 18, 40720) But on return from Delang he would be free to devote his time and energy to

('73', 22, 18, 22, 40952) The communal riots in Allahabadthe headquarters of the Congressand the necessity of summoning the assistance of the police and even the military show that the Congress has not yet become fit to substitute the British authority.
('73', 22, 18, 23, 41180) It is best to face this naked truth, however unpleasant it may be.
('73', 22, 18, 24, 41247) The Congress claims to represent the whole of India, not merely those few who are on the Congress register.
('73', 22, 18, 25, 41355) It should represent even those who are hostile to it and who will even crush it, if they could.
('73', 22, 18, 26, 41451) Not until we make good that claim, shall we be in a position to
('73', 22, 19, 27, 41515) 1 Twenty members of the Bengal Legislative Assembly and two members of the Legislative Council had about an hours discussion with Gandhiji in the afternoon.
('73', 22, 19, 28, 41672) 2 From the reference to this article in Talk with Co workers, 22 3 1938
('73', 23, 0, 1, 41744) 24 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 23, 1, 2, 41785) displace the British Government and function as an independent nation.
('73', 23, 1, 3, 41856) This proposition holds good whether we seek to displace British rule by violent action or non violent.
('73', 23, 1, 4, 41959) Most probably by the time these lines appear in print, peace would have been established in Allahabad and the other parts.
('73', 23, 1, 5, 42082) That, however, will not take us further in our examination of the fitness of the Congress as an organization ready to displace British authority in its entirety.
('73', 23, 1, 6, 42244) No Congressman will seriously doubt that the Congress is not at the present moment capable of delivering the goods if it was called upon to do so.
('73', 23, 1, 7, 42391) If it was capable, it would not wait for the call.
('73', 23, 1, 8, 42442) But every Congressman believes that the Congress is fast becoming such a body.
('73', 23, 1, 9, 42521) The brilliant success at Haripura will be cited as the most conclusive proof of the fact.
('73', 23, 1, 10, 42611) The riots and certain other things I can mention should make us pause and ask ourselves whether the Congress is really growing from strength to strength.
('73', 23, 1, 11, 42765) I must own that I have been guilty of laying that claim.
('73', 23, 1, 12, 42822) Have I been overhasty in doing so?
('73', 23, 1, 13, 42857) It is my conviction that the phenomenal growth of the Congress is due to its acceptance and enforcement, however imperfect, of the policy of non violence.
('73', 23, 1, 14, 43012) Time has arrived to consider the nature of Congress non violence.
('73', 23, 1, 15, 43078) Is it non violence of the weak and the helpless or of the strong and the powerful?
('73', 23, 1, 16, 43161) If it is the former, it will never take us to our goal and, if long practised, may even render us for ever unfit for self government.
('73', 23, 1, 17, 43295) The weak and helpless are non violent in action because they must be.
('73', 23, 1, 18, 43365) But in reality they harbour violence in their breasts and simply await opportunity for its display.
('73', 23, 1, 19, 43465) It is necessary for Congressmen individually and collectively to examine the quality of their non violence.
('73', 23, 1, 20, 43573) If it does not come out of real strength, it would be best and honest for the Congress to make such a declaration and make the necessary changes in its behaviour.
('73', 23, 1, 21, 43736) By this time, i.
('73', 23, 1, 22, 43753) e., after seventeen years practice of non violence, the Congress should be able to put forth a non violent army of volunteers numbering not a few thousands but lacs who would be equal to every occasion where the police and the military are required.
('73', 23, 1, 23, 44003) Thus, instead of one brave Pashupatinath Gupta who died 1 in the
('73', 23, 2, 24, 44068) 1 Mahadev Desai, however, reported in Harijan, 2 4 1938, that Pashupatinath Gupta, though seriously stabbed, was making satisfactory progress.

('73', 24, 1, 3, 44324) And a non violent army acts unlike armed men, as well in times of peace as of disturbances.
('73', 24, 1, 4, 44416) They would be constantly engaged in constructive activities that make riots impossible.
('73', 24, 1, 5, 44504) Theirs will be the duty of seeking occasions for bringing warring communities together, carrying on peace propaganda, engaging in activities that would bring and keep them in touch with every single person, male and female, adult and child, in their parish or division.
('73', 24, 1, 6, 44774) Such an army should be ready to cope with any emergency, and in order to still the frenzy of mobs, should risk their lives in numbers sufficient for the purpose.
('73', 24, 1, 7, 44936) A few hundred, maybe a few thousand, such spotless deaths will once for all put an end to the riots.
('73', 24, 1, 8, 45037) Surely a few hundred young men and women giving themselves deliberately to mob fury will be any day a cheap and braver method of dealing with such madness than the display and use of the police and the military.
('73', 24, 1, 9, 45249) It has been suggested that when we have our independence riots and the like will not occur.
('73', 24, 1, 10, 45341) This seems to me to be an empty hope, if in the course of the struggle for freedom we do not understand and use the technique of non violent action in every conceivable circumstance.
('73', 24, 1, 11, 45524) To the extent that the Congress Ministers have been obliged to make use of the police and the military, to that extent, in my opinion, we must admit our failure.
('73', 24, 1, 12, 45686) That the Ministers could not have done otherwise is unfortunately only too true.
('73', 24, 1, 13, 45767) I should like every Congressman, I should like the Working Committee, to ask themselves why we have failed, if they think with me that we have.

('73', 24, 5, 17, 46016) SHARDA, In my stupidity I did not bring ink and now I have to write with pencil.
('73', 24, 5, 18, 46097) I hope you will be able to read my handwriting.
('73', 24, 5, 19, 46145) Stay there without bothering yourself.

('73', 25, 1, 3, 46437) Are you willing ever to leave my protecting wing?
('73', 25, 1, 4, 46487) Are you going to abandon me when you get married?
('73', 25, 1, 5, 46537) Chimanlal has of course put you in my charge.
('73', 25, 1, 6, 46583) Shakaribehn too handed you over to me at Haripura.
('73', 25, 1, 7, 46634) Moreover, I am constantly on the move at present, hence you cannot [always] be near me.
('73', 25, 1, 8, 46722) And I have no occasion to take you round with me.
('73', 25, 1, 9, 46772) I am writing to Brijkrishna and Devdas that you have received the books.
('73', 25, 1, 10, 46845) I can understand your hesitation.
('73', 25, 1, 11, 46879) It is good that you are able to have some music [lessons].
('73', 25, 1, 12, 46938) There is nothing very alarming in your having had [too many] motions.
('73', 25, 1, 13, 47008) The greatest art about eating consists in eating only what one can digest.
('73', 25, 1, 14, 47083) Hence even if some unwholesome food is taken it should not do much harm.
('73', 25, 1, 15, 47156) I am doubtful about uncooked gram.
('73', 25, 1, 16, 47191) But it would do no harm if taken in quantities you can digest.
('73', 25, 1, 17, 47254) The same is true about berries.
('73', 25, 1, 18, 47286) Does Maulvi Saheb come there?
('73', 25, 1, 19, 47316) I have not heard from him at all.
('73', 25, 1, 20, 47350) I am going to Delang, Orissa, on the 24th.
('73', 25, 1, 21, 47393) I shall be back here on the 1st of April.
('73', 25, 1, 22, 47435) I am all right.

('73', 25, 8, 29, 47650) I stupidly did not bring the ink pot and Kanu is not quite as thoughtful and solicitous as you.
('73', 25, 8, 30, 47746) So I can only give you a pencil letter.

('73', 26, 1, 2, 47860) The bath 1 has been most useful.
('73', 26, 1, 3, 47893) That it might not have been with me but for your watchfulness was due to Kanus thoughtlessness.
('73', 26, 1, 4, 47989) He is still shaping.
('73', 26, 1, 5, 48010) I am really keeping extraordinarily well.
('73', 26, 1, 6, 48052) I have hazarded an experiment for the love of a good man.

('73', 26, 1, 11, 48308) I must come back to C[alcutta] for the Working Committee.
('73', 26, 1, 12, 48366) You must not feel disturbed.
('73', 26, 1, 13, 48395) Resign yourself to God.

('73', 26, 5, 22, 48707) MY DEAR IDIOT, Either I write with a pencil or not at all.
('73', 26, 5, 23, 48766) Kanu did not bring the ink pot and I stupidly refrained.
('73', 26, 5, 24, 48823) There is no fountain pen by and there is no ordinary pen or ink in this household.
('73', 26, 5, 25, 48906) This is a mere busi ness letter, no time for more.
('73', 26, 5, 26, 48957) There is no likelihood of a vacancy in C. P. But what I suggest is that you may send in a general letter to the President and respective Premiers the names of those women who, in your opinion, are capable of holding responsible offices.
('73', 26, 5, 27, 49194) There your function as President should end.
('73', 26, 5, 28, 49239) As to Delhi, Brijkrishna is worth his weight in gold, so far as honesty is concerned.
('73', 26, 5, 29, 49325) But I discount his estimates of facts and events.
('73', 26, 5, 30, 49375) But everything will be fixed up now that the Sardar and Shankerlal are there.

('73', 27, 5, 10, 49960) I could not help writing that article 3. I want you to read it.
('73', 27, 5, 11, 50024) I feel ashamed that our Ministers had to call to their aid the police and the military.
('73', 27, 5, 12, 50112) I am ashamed that they had to use the language that they did in reply to the Opposition speeches.
('73', 27, 5, 13, 50210) I feel as if the Congress had lost and the British had won.
('73', 27, 5, 14, 50270) Why does our non violence fail on such occasions?
('73', 27, 5, 15, 50320) Is it the non violence of the weak?
('73', 27, 5, 16, 50356) Even the goondas should not move us from our faith and make us say: We will send them to the gallows or shoot them down if necessary. They too are our countrymen.
('73', 27, 5, 17, 50519) If they will kill us, we must allow them to do so.
('73', 27, 5, 18, 50570) You cannot pit against organized violence the non violence of the weak, but the non violence which the bravest alone can exercise.
('73', 27, 5, 19, 50701) 4 We have, you will say, been sufficiently non violent.
('73', 27, 5, 20, 50757) We were non violent during the civil disobedience campaign, we received lathi blows and worse.
('73', 27, 5, 21, 50852) My reply is this: We did, but not sufficiently.
('73', 27, 5, 22, 50900) We could not get independence at the end of the Dandi March 5, as ours was not the unadulterated non violence of the bravest.
('73', 27, 5, 23, 51026) We did take many a step forward as a result of the sufferings we went through, but there was lurking in us violence.
('73', 27, 5, 24, 51143) That was why I had to make that statement 6 in Patna in 1934, and I am sure that if I had not advised the calling off of the civil disobedience campaign, we should have been

('73', 29, 10, 20, 53804) for Delang.
('73', 29, 10, 21, 53816) 2 Held under the auspices of the Gandhi Seva Sangh the Exhibition was declared open by Gandhiji at 8.15 a.
('73', 29, 10, 22, 53923) after a prayer by Gopabandhu Chowdhary and flag hoisting and the opening address by Vallabhbhai Patel.
('73', 29, 10, 23, 54026) Some 50,000 people were present.
('73', 29, 10, 24, 54059) The Hindi report has been collated with the version in Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter.

('73', 30, 1, 2, 54193) the strength to speak to you at any great length.
('73', 30, 1, 3, 54243) You know that in the whole of our country the land of Orissa is the dearest to me.
('73', 30, 1, 4, 54326) As soon as I returned to India I began to hear of Orissas poverty and famine.
('73', 30, 1, 5, 54404) We raised an amount and sent over Thakkar Bapa in the capacity of a servant of this afflicted province and organized famine relief.
('73', 30, 1, 6, 54536) I also realized that if I could serve Orissa somewhat I would by so doing serve India.
('73', 30, 1, 7, 54623) Thus Orissa became for me a place of pilgrimagenot because the temple of Lord Jagannath was therefor it was not open to me, as it was not open to the Harijansbut because I thought of a novel way of touring the country for the sacred mission of the abolition of untouchability.
('73', 30, 1, 8, 54900) I had heard that the so called sanatanists were enraged at my mission of removing untouchability and would even try to frustrate it with violence.
('73', 30, 1, 9, 55047) If they were really so minded, I said to myself, I should make their work easy by discarding the rail way train and motor car and trekking through the country.
('73', 30, 1, 10, 55207) Moreover, people dont go on a pilgrimage in cars and trains.
('73', 30, 1, 11, 55268) They walk to the sacred place, with the name of God on their lips.
('73', 30, 1, 12, 55335) Meditating on Him; they proceed along their way, forgetful of the fitful fever of the world, and mindful only of offering their homage to the Lord the homage of service.
('73', 30, 1, 13, 55505) At least for me it is not possible to be so engrossed in meditation while on a rail journey.
('73', 30, 1, 14, 55598) And if there was trouble in Puri because of the anger of the sanatanists, we could not flee from their wrath.
('73', 30, 1, 15, 55708) It does not behove a satyagrahi to run away.
('73', 30, 1, 16, 55753) We must face it.
('73', 30, 1, 17, 55770) I could not do all this in a car or a railway train, and so I decided to perform the rest of the Harijan pilgrimage on foot.
('73', 30, 1, 18, 55895) 1 The temple of Lord Jagannath has the reputation of being the most famous in India, for there all human distinctions are supposed to vanish, and all sorts of people, Brahmin and pariah, brush shoulders with one another vying for the darshan of the Lord and even eat His prasad out of one anothers hands.
('73', 30, 1, 19, 56200) But evidently it had outlived that reputation and the description had become a fiction, for the priests would not admit Harijans, but throw them out of the doors of the Lord of the World.
('73', 30, 1, 20, 56388) I said to myself that so long as these distinctions of high and low endured before the very eyes of the Lord of the World, that Lord was not my Lord, that He was the Lord of the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas who exploited his name and kept Harijans out, but certainly not the Lord of the World.
('73', 30, 1, 21, 56681) My ambition of restoring its old reputation to the temple is yet unfulfilled, and you have to help me in fulfilling it.
('73', 30, 2, 22, 56801) 1 In May 1934; vide Statement to the Press, 8 5 1934
('73', 31, 0, 1, 56854) 32 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 31, 1, 2, 56895) long as the doors of the Jagannath temple are closed to the Harijans, they are closed to me as well.
('73', 31, 1, 3, 56996) Ever since my tour along with the local workers and Thakkar Bapa, my contact with the province has been very close.
('73', 31, 1, 4, 57112) The people of Orissa have the doubtful reputation of being opium addicts, even learned men not being free from the vice, as I found ten years ago.
('73', 31, 1, 5, 57259) They are also indolent and lethargic.
('73', 31, 1, 6, 57297) I know you will not mind my using this language, for you know the spirit in which it is being used.
('73', 31, 1, 7, 57397) You know what great love I have for you.
('73', 31, 1, 8, 57438) The people of Orissa are responsible for its poverty.
('73', 31, 1, 9, 57492) Orissa is the land of poverty because of its opium, indolence and bigotry.
('73', 31, 1, 10, 57567) The Exhibition gives me the hope that Orissa can rid itself of all these evils and be once again a land of happiness and plenty.
('73', 31, 1, 11, 57696) After a round of the Exhibition the predominant thought in my mind is that if Oriyas can throw off their indolence they can get rid of poverty.
('73', 31, 1, 12, 57840) The Exhibition is bound to be a revelation to the villagers attending it of the great capacities and potentialities of the province.
('73', 31, 1, 13, 57973) All those who have come here should see the Exhibition not once but several times.
('73', 31, 1, 14, 58056) When it was decided to hold the Exhibition in this place, no one had any idea that the Government might offer help.
('73', 31, 1, 15, 58172) The workers co operation was taken for granted, for after all they are our own people.
('73', 31, 1, 16, 58259) But the local Government is also ours.
('73', 31, 1, 17, 58298) There is nothing surprising if they extended their co operation.
('73', 31, 1, 18, 58363) Yes, thanks certainly are due to them.
('73', 31, 1, 19, 58402) The workers with the co operation of the Government have been able to bring into being an exhibition which is well worth a close study by men and women, young and old.
('73', 31, 1, 20, 58570) There are so many young people around who, if they chose to pick up a thing and make a study of it so as to learn how it was done, could earn their livelihood without great effort.
('73', 31, 1, 21, 58751) Man differs from the beast in several ways.
('73', 31, 1, 22, 58795) As the late Madhusudan Das used to say, one of the distinctions is the differing anatomy of both.
('73', 31, 1, 23, 58893) Man has feet and hands with fingers that he can use intelligently and artistically.
('73', 31, 1, 24, 58977) If man therefore depended wholly and solely on agriculture, he would not be using the fingers that God has specially endowed him with.
('73', 31, 1, 25, 59112) We will be worthy of being called human beings if we utilize our fingers.
('73', 31, 1, 26, 59186) Moreover, mere agriculture cannot support us, unless it is supplemented by the work of the hands and the fingers.
('73', 31, 1, 27, 59300) We see in the Exhibition what mans hands and fingers can produce and how they can supplement the income of the land.
('73', 31, 1, 28, 59417) I would therefore ask every one of you to go to the Exhibition over and
('73', 32, 0, 1, 59489) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 33
('73', 32, 1, 2, 59538) over again, pick up a handicraft of your choice and help in casting off the poverty of the land.
('73', 32, 1, 3, 59635) The A. I. V. I. A. has come into being to turn every home into a workshop.
('73', 32, 1, 4, 59710) You should visit the Exhibition with the aim of acquiring knowledge and, having learnt one or the other thing that serves your own purpose, serve the province at large.

('73', 32, 5, 9, 60041) DELANG, March 25, 1938 Does my voice reach you there where you are all sitting?
('73', 32, 5, 10, 60121) Please let me know if you cannot hear me.
('73', 32, 5, 11, 60163) People have been thinking that I am unwell and that is why I speak in a low voice.
('73', 32, 5, 12, 60246) It is not so.
('73', 32, 5, 13, 60260) This is a habit with me.
('73', 32, 5, 14, 60285) Hence, I would ask you, if you find me inaudible, not to put up with it in order to be kind to me.
('73', 32, 5, 15, 60384) Even when I was well, I seldom concluded in the same pitch in which I began.
('73', 32, 5, 16, 60461) While speaking, I often forget that I am speaking to others.
('73', 32, 5, 17, 60522) Then my voice drops and when I realize the fact I raise it again.
('73', 32, 5, 18, 60588) When I was physically fit, I did not have to make use of a microphone.
('73', 32, 5, 19, 60659) Today also, if you cannot hear me because my voice is too low, let me say that it is not my fault but that of the microphone.
('73', 32, 5, 20, 60785) I have been told that the microphone has such power that the lower the voice the greater the number of people it reaches.
('73', 32, 5, 21, 60907) Hence one should speak in a low voice into a microphone.
('73', 32, 5, 22, 60964) The people who operate it are also our own people.
('73', 32, 5, 23, 61015) They do this work in order to earn their livelihood.
('73', 32, 5, 24, 61068) Please inform me if my voice is not audible to you.
('73', 32, 5, 25, 61120) Today, I am in a pitiable position.
('73', 32, 5, 26, 61156) Although I have come here, I can take part neither in the Executive Committee nor in the conven tion.
('73', 32, 5, 27, 61258) I have become a dharmadhyaksha 2 and am delivering a speech.
('73', 32, 5, 28, 61319) This is contrary to my nature.
('73', 32, 5, 29, 61350) I do not regard myself as a religious head.
('73', 32, 5, 30, 61394) I am a votary of truth and I seek after truth.
('73', 32, 5, 31, 61441) In this, you are my
('73', 32, 6, 32, 61461) 1 Gandhiji arrived at 4 p.
('73', 32, 6, 33, 61488) and addressed the opening session.
('73', 32, 6, 34, 61523) This is the gist of his speech.
('73', 32, 6, 35, 61555) 2 Religious head
('73', 33, 0, 1, 61572) 34 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 33, 1, 2, 61613) fellow seekers.
('73', 33, 1, 3, 61629) The proper thing is to compare notes.
('73', 33, 1, 4, 61667) If, after delibe rations, we can arrive at a conclusion, well and good, if not, it matters little.
('73', 33, 1, 5, 61766) Although today I have become crippled, so long as God keeps me on the earth I do learn something.
('73', 33, 1, 6, 61864) And I do long to pass on to you what I possess, whatever knowledge I have acquired.
('73', 33, 1, 7, 61948) I would like to pass it on to you first of all.
('73', 33, 1, 8, 61996) But sometimes I become impatient.
('73', 33, 1, 9, 62030) You will find in Harijan what I wanted to say in this regard.
('73', 33, 1, 10, 62092) 1 There is nothing new in it, but it has been presented in a new form.
('73', 33, 1, 11, 62163) There is not a trace of arrogance in what I am saying to youI am impatient to pass on to you whatever occurs to me but does not occur to you.
('73', 33, 1, 12, 62305) I am a worshipper of non violence and so are you.
('73', 33, 1, 13, 62355) Many amongst you have faith in it.
('73', 33, 1, 14, 62390) I have been a worshipper and ser vant of non violence for fifty years.
('73', 33, 1, 15, 62461) There is no exaggeration here.
('73', 33, 1, 16, 62492) I shall complete seventy soon.
('73', 33, 1, 17, 62523) My faith in non violence and my conscious effort to achieve it has been there since I was fourteen or fifteen.
('73', 33, 1, 18, 62634) Since then I have had my faith in non violence, based on reason.
('73', 33, 1, 19, 62699) And my worship of truth dates even further back.
('73', 33, 1, 20, 62748) For more than fifty years I have, in all my dealings, been relying on truth alone.
('73', 33, 1, 21, 62831) Only such dedicated conduct results in knowledge and wisdom.
('73', 33, 1, 22, 62892) If a person who has always acted in accordance with truth and non violence for more than fifty years makes the claim that he has this one thing, it cannot be called arro gance.
('73', 33, 1, 23, 63069) Under this belief I also wrote out a brief article.
('73', 33, 1, 24, 63121) Although the doctors have forbidden me, I could not restrain myself because of what happened in Bihar and the U. P. This time, too, I wish to tell you many things, but only if I get an opportunity and, if the blood pressure does not rise.
('73', 33, 1, 25, 63360) Today I wish to put before you only that which is weighing heavily on me.
('73', 33, 1, 26, 63434) You should give deep thought to it.
('73', 33, 1, 27, 63470) Before that I wish to tell you something about what Kishorelal 2
('73', 33, 2, 28, 63535) is going to read out to you.
('73', 33, 2, 29, 63564) I have gone through his speech.
('73', 33, 2, 30, 63596) Although weak in body, he has produced a hundred and twenty three pages.
('73', 33, 2, 31, 63669) It is in four parts.
('73', 33, 2, 32, 63690) His idea is to deliver the speech in four instalments on four evenings.
('73', 33, 2, 33, 63762) In one of these he has generally described our short comings and failings.
('73', 33, 2, 34, 63837) I told him to deliver three of these.
('73', 33, 2, 35, 63875) At my request, the fourth has been omitted.
('73', 33, 2, 36, 63919) I shall put before you that which has touched my heart.
('73', 33, 2, 37, 63975) Truth and non violence are the objectives of the Gandhi Seva
('73', 33, 3, 38, 64036) 1 Vide Our Failure 22 3 1938
('73', 33, 4, 39, 64065) 2 Kishorelal Mashruwala, President, Gandhi Seva Sangh
('73', 34, 0, 1, 64119) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 35
('73', 34, 1, 2, 64168) But if we practise these only in our struggle against the Government and not in our private dealings or in inter provincial relationships, what would we gain?
('73', 34, 1, 3, 64327) This would imply that even members of the Gandhi Seva Sangh are not consciously truthful and non violent in their dealings with one another.
('73', 34, 1, 4, 64468) I am giving you a summary of his speech.
('73', 34, 1, 5, 64509) He says that there are but a few persons in the Gandhi Seva Sangh, and yet there are differences of opinion resulting in mutual bickering.
('73', 34, 1, 6, 64648) Quarrels as such are to be found throughout the world.
('73', 34, 1, 7, 64703) But we should be careful about their consequences.
('73', 34, 1, 8, 64754) Our duty is to keep up our efforts.
('73', 34, 1, 9, 64790) If anyone says that formerly Mahadev was bad tempered and arrogant but now he is not what he was a year ago, that now he is changed, has become somewhat humble, and if it is something which not only Mahadev but Durga and their son also feel, then it means the influence of non violence is growing.
('73', 34, 1, 10, 65088) But if he thinks that he has now attained perfection, and if he no longer has the thoughtfulness and vigilance which he formerly had, he would be making a grave error.
('73', 34, 1, 11, 65256) A unique feature of truth and non violence is that one must daily take some spiritual food.
('73', 34, 1, 12, 65348) Have not the Upanishads said that this is like walking on the edge of a sword?
('73', 34, 1, 13, 65427) I claimed that my spiritual striving extended beyond fifty years.
('73', 34, 1, 14, 65493) If from this I conclude that there is no further need for me to be on my guard, it must be said that my downfall has started from that very moment.
('73', 34, 1, 15, 65641) If I am lecturing to you, I am also doing it to myself.
('73', 34, 1, 16, 65697) I do not say this only to impress you.
('73', 34, 1, 17, 65736) I do not deliver speeches merely for the pleasure of it.
('73', 34, 1, 18, 65793) I do what the atman bids me do.
('73', 34, 1, 19, 65825) What I am saying to you will have its effect on me too.
('73', 34, 1, 20, 65881) If that were not so, I would become as insignificant as a blade of grass.
('73', 34, 1, 21, 65955) Nor should you conclude that I am using these words only to get my work done while sitting with friends.
('73', 34, 1, 22, 66060) If in our dealings with friends we are not on our guard and do not practise truth and non violence, but make use of them only in politics, it would amount to practising diplomacy.
('73', 34, 1, 23, 66240) Truth can also be uttered diplomatically.
('73', 34, 1, 24, 66282) I do not approve of the English saying Honesty is the best policy.
('73', 34, 1, 25, 66349) I do not wish to use truth and non violence for diplomatic purposes.
('73', 34, 1, 26, 66418) I am talking of ultimate values.
('73', 34, 1, 27, 66451) If I am truthful and non violent in my worldly dealings and if the world responds to me with contempt and if as a result I lose my faith in them, my non violence is worthless.
('73', 34, 1, 28, 66627) Then it is merely the best form of diplo macy.
('73', 34, 1, 29, 66674) You should not take it for an ultimate value.
('73', 34, 1, 30, 66720) If it is not such a worthless thing, there ought to be love between friends.
('73', 34, 1, 31, 66797) Kishorelal and I are sitting side by side.
('73', 34, 1, 32, 66840) Should Kishorelal have
('73', 35, 0, 1, 66863) 36 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 35, 1, 2, 66904) affection for me only if love is returned with love?
('73', 35, 1, 3, 66957) I have become old, I lose my temper, I am not prepared to listen to anything; should he then forsake me?
('73', 35, 1, 4, 67062) On the contrary, he should not be displeased, he should remain non violent, he should have compassion for me.
('73', 35, 1, 5, 67172) Non violence, by increasing ones forbearance and love, teaches one truth.
('73', 35, 1, 6, 67246) Love is not a matter of bargain or conditions.
('73', 35, 1, 7, 67293) One who remains non violent towards a non violent person can hardly be called non violent !
('73', 35, 1, 8, 67385) In this case, man follows his own nature.
('73', 35, 1, 9, 67427) The world will call me courageous if I die in an encounter with a murderer.
('73', 35, 1, 10, 67503) But I should not take this course in order to get such acclamation.
('73', 35, 1, 11, 67571) Kishorelal has also given some instances in his speech.
('73', 35, 1, 12, 67627) But I have omitted them.
('73', 35, 1, 13, 67652) What use have we for names?
('73', 35, 1, 14, 67680) I was afraid that the mention of names and personalities might even have an adverse effect.
('73', 35, 1, 15, 67772) Hence I have left these out.
('73', 35, 1, 16, 67801) Now understand this.
('73', 35, 1, 17, 67822) We should also put an end to provincialism.
('73', 35, 1, 18, 67866) If the Andhras claimed that Andhra is for them alone, if the people of Orissa claimed that Orissa is only theirs, it will give rise to provincialism.
('73', 35, 1, 19, 68016) The right thing for both Andhra and Orissa is to be prepared to sacrifice themselves for the country and the world.
('73', 35, 1, 20, 68132) And India must offer herself at the altar of the world.
('73', 35, 1, 21, 68188) That will be her true test.
('73', 35, 1, 22, 68216) I am not advancing a new idea, I am only reminding you of it on a suitable occasion.
('73', 35, 1, 23, 68301) The recent incidents in Kanpur and Allahabad have deeply affected me.
('73', 35, 1, 24, 68371) Such incidents are not going to bring us swaraj.
('73', 35, 1, 25, 68420) I have discussed the matter with Subhas Babu, Maulana Azad and others.
('73', 35, 1, 26, 68491) The conclusion I have arrived at after Haripura is that if matters are as we saw them there, despite all our failings we may be able to see purna swaraj within my lifetime.
('73', 35, 1, 27, 68664) If we can accomplish our task intelligently, the British will have to admit defeat at our hands.
('73', 35, 1, 28, 68761) There will be only one power in India with whom they can discuss matters, and that power will be the Congress.
('73', 35, 1, 29, 68872) There will be nothing left for them to do.
('73', 35, 1, 30, 68915) They will be prepared to help if the people so desire.
('73', 35, 1, 31, 68970) They will ask us what we expect from them.
('73', 35, 1, 32, 69013) This strength can be generated within us through truth and non violence alone.
('73', 35, 1, 33, 69092) If we can develop this strength within us in a year, the Viceroy will have to invite Subhas Babu and ask him what the latter wanted from him.
('73', 35, 1, 34, 69234) Even the British Government may send for Subhas Babu because the British are losing in power and prestige in Europe.
('73', 35, 1, 35, 69351) But that is not what I have in mind.
('73', 35, 1, 36, 69388) A non violent person has no enemies.
('73', 35, 1, 37, 69425) But if one who calls himself an enemy loses his strength, a non violent person feels compassion for him.
('73', 35, 1, 38, 69530) He does not wish to take advantage of the formers predicament to mount on his back.
('73', 35, 1, 39, 69614) He resumes his
('73', 36, 0, 1, 69629) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 37
('73', 36, 1, 2, 69678) fight only when the former is out of his troubles.
('73', 36, 1, 3, 69729) This is how I worked in South Africa.
('73', 36, 1, 4, 69767) I found that it happened not only in the U. P. and in Allahabad, but in the Central Provinces and in other places also.
('73', 36, 1, 5, 69887) Police and even military assistance had to be sought to put down the riots.
('73', 36, 1, 6, 69963) I do not wish to say that the Ministers were to blame.
('73', 36, 1, 7, 70018) What could poor Govind Ballabh Pant do?
('73', 36, 1, 8, 70058) I am not criticizing him.
('73', 36, 1, 9, 70084) He had to act in his capacity as a Minister.
('73', 36, 1, 10, 70129) Whatever he did was correct.
('73', 36, 1, 11, 70158) The fault lies with me.
('73', 36, 1, 12, 70182) The conclusion which I drew from what I saw in Haripura was erroneous.
('73', 36, 1, 13, 70253) I felt that we could accomplish whatever we wanted within a year and that we had developed the strength for it.
('73', 36, 1, 14, 70365) But I now realize that I had made a mistake.
('73', 36, 1, 15, 70410) I believe that if today the Viceroy sent for Subhas Babu, or Jawaharlal or me and asked us what we wanted, I would reply that I was not equal to the task.
('73', 36, 1, 16, 70565) Today, we do not have the strength to respond.
('73', 36, 1, 17, 70612) If we tell the Viceroy that we do not need the police or the army and that we can defend ourselves, that we have the weapon of non violence, that the Muslims are our friends and so are the Pathans, that we shall ourselves tackle the Princes, that we shall bear with the Sikhs, he would conclude that I was out of my wits.
('73', 36, 1, 18, 70934) This was not the state of affairs in 1920. When we are ready, we shall have within us the strength to come to a reasonable understanding with the Muslims, the Princes and the zamindars.
('73', 36, 1, 19, 71120) Today, we have power neither over the Princes nor over the zamindars, neither over the Muslims nor over the Sikhs.
('73', 36, 1, 20, 71235) Leaving aside others, do we have con trol even over those who are within the Congress?
('73', 36, 1, 21, 71322) Not at all.
('73', 36, 1, 22, 71334) I have seen that there were internal fights to acquire control over the Con gress office.
('73', 36, 1, 23, 71424) I find in the Congress names of persons who were not in the organization at all.
('73', 36, 1, 24, 71505) But let it be.
('73', 36, 1, 25, 71520) I only wanted to say that if this state of affairs continued, we would not win swaraj in thirty years, let alone one.
('73', 36, 1, 26, 71638) I feel that we can not truthfully say that we can come to an understanding with all these people.
('73', 36, 1, 27, 71736) And then again, if we have true non violence in us we should have the strength to say these things and to act accordingly.
('73', 36, 1, 28, 71859) Hence I ask you, is our non violence the non violence of the coward, the weak, the helpless, the timid?
('73', 36, 1, 29, 71963) In that case, it is of no value.
('73', 36, 1, 30, 71996) A weakling is a born saint.
('73', 36, 1, 31, 72024) A weak person is obliged to become a saint.
('73', 36, 1, 32, 72068) But we are soldiers of non violence, who, if the occasion demands, will lay down their lives for it.
('73', 36, 1, 33, 72169) Our non violence is not a mere policy of the coward.
('73', 36, 1, 34, 72222) But I doubt this.
('73', 36, 1, 35, 72240) I am afraid that the non violence we boast of might really be only a policy.
('73', 36, 1, 36, 72317) It is true that, to some extent, non violence works even in the hands of the weak.
('73', 37, 0, 1, 72400) 38 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 37, 1, 2, 72441) And, in this manner, this weapon has been useful to us.
('73', 37, 1, 3, 72497) But, if one makes use of non violence in order to disguise ones weakness or through helplessness, it makes a coward of one.
('73', 37, 1, 4, 72621) Such a person is defeated on both the fronts.
('73', 37, 1, 5, 72667) Such a one cannot live like a man and the Devil he surely cannot become.
('73', 37, 1, 6, 72740) It is a thousand times better that we die trying to acquire the strength of the arm.
('73', 37, 1, 7, 72825) Using physical force with courage is far superior to cowardice.
('73', 37, 1, 8, 72889) At least we would have attempted to act like men.
('73', 37, 1, 9, 72939) That was the way of our forefathers.
('73', 37, 1, 10, 72976) That is because some people hold the view that the ancestors of the human race were animals.
('73', 37, 1, 11, 73069) I do not wish to enter into the controversy whether Darwins theory is tenable or not.
('73', 37, 1, 12, 73155) However, from one standpoint we must all have originally been animals.
('73', 37, 1, 13, 73226) And I am ready to believe that we are evolved from the animal into the human state.
('73', 37, 1, 14, 73310) That is why physical strength is called brute force.
('73', 37, 1, 15, 73363) We are born with such strength, hence if we used it we could be, to say the least, courageous.
('73', 37, 1, 16, 73458) But we are born as human beings in order that we may realize God who dwells within our hearts.
('73', 37, 1, 17, 73553) This is the basic distinction between us and the beasts.
('73', 37, 1, 18, 73610) It is not that the serpent crawls on its belly, whereas we walk on our legs.
('73', 37, 1, 19, 73687) The bullock has four legs, I have two.
('73', 37, 1, 20, 73726) We have attained the human form.
('73', 37, 1, 21, 73759) We are evolved gradually from such species as the serpent, etc., to the human state.
('73', 37, 1, 22, 73844) Along with the human form, we also have human powerthat is the power of non violence.
('73', 37, 1, 23, 73930) We can have an insight into the mystery of soul force.
('73', 37, 1, 24, 73985) In that consists our huma nity.
('73', 37, 1, 25, 74017) Man is by nature non violent.
('73', 37, 1, 26, 74047) But he does not owe his origin to non violence.
('73', 37, 1, 27, 74095) We fulfil our human life when we see the atman, and when we do so we pass the test.
('73', 37, 1, 28, 74179) Now is the time for our test.
('73', 37, 1, 29, 74209) God realization means seeing Him in all beings.
('73', 37, 1, 30, 74257) Or, in other words, we should learn to become one with every creature.
('73', 37, 1, 31, 74328) This is mans privilege and that distinguishes him from the beasts.
('73', 37, 1, 32, 74395) This can happen only when we voluntarily give up the use of physical force and when we develop the non violence which lies dormant in our hearts.
('73', 37, 1, 33, 74541) It can be awakened only through real strength.
('73', 37, 1, 34, 74588) Do we really have this non violence of the strong?
('73', 37, 1, 35, 74639) If not, we are in the sorry plight of Trishanku 1. The better thing would be to admit that ahimsadharma is an impracticable ideal and then to give it up and adopt violence.
('73', 37, 1, 36, 74812) But now we are unable to advance even a step farther than the non viol ence of the weak.
('73', 37, 1, 37, 74901) Now we have no alternative but to choose between the two.
('73', 37, 1, 38, 74959) If you do not decide this issue, who will?
('73', 37, 1, 39, 75002) If you regard

('73', 38, 1, 2, 75128) non violence as a principle and not a policy and if you live for it, it becomes your responsibility, although your number may be small, to give proof of true non violence in your own lives.
('73', 38, 1, 3, 75318) If your non viol ence is genuine and not assumed just to disguise your weakness, the faults pointed out by Kishorelal will not arise at all.
('73', 38, 1, 4, 75459) I have been saying this since 1920. You will ask mewhat then should we do?
('73', 38, 1, 5, 75534) You should under stand well what I tell you.
('73', 38, 1, 6, 75579) There are several things you can do.
('73', 38, 1, 7, 75616) I wish to take up one of these.
('73', 38, 1, 8, 75648) That is the misunderstanding or hostility between Hindus and Muslims.
('73', 38, 1, 9, 75718) Our mutual ill will is on the increase.
('73', 38, 1, 10, 75758) What happened in Allahabad, what took place in the U. P. today, may happen tomorrow in Bombay and Calcutta.
('73', 38, 1, 11, 75866) In Calcutta, it may even be worse than in Allahabad.
('73', 38, 1, 12, 75919) This is not something new in our country.
('73', 38, 1, 13, 75961) If this is solved, other issues will soon be resolved.
('73', 38, 1, 14, 76016) In this lies our test.
('73', 38, 1, 15, 76039) You, can ask me what you should have done in Allahabad had you been true followers of non violence.
('73', 38, 1, 16, 76139) I would say that Govind Ballabh Pant was not needed there.
('73', 38, 1, 17, 76198) That issue should have been tackled by the Allahabad Congress Committee.
('73', 38, 1, 18, 76271) It could have mustered ten thousand volunteers.
('73', 38, 1, 19, 76319) I had presented a draft of their pledge in 1921 1 I had prepared it myself.
('73', 38, 1, 20, 76395) The Congress approved of it and I had also put it before the Khilafat Committee.
('73', 38, 1, 21, 76476) Hakim Saheb was in the chair.
('73', 38, 1, 22, 76506) Hasrat Mohani opposed the motion.
('73', 38, 1, 23, 76540) He said that I wanted to make slaves of the Muslims.
('73', 38, 1, 24, 76593) They may well remain non violent in word and deed but Islam does not ordain them to remain non violent in thought.
('73', 38, 1, 25, 76708) He accused me of wanting to dominate Muslim minds as well.
('73', 38, 1, 26, 76767) The ulemas 2 who were present there understood what I wanted to convey.
('73', 38, 1, 27, 76839) Maulana Azad is a very intelliigent person.
('73', 38, 1, 28, 76883) He had understood me right at the beginning I told them that I did not wish to make myself or any other person the master.
('73', 38, 1, 29, 77006) But I wished to give this status to non violence.
('73', 38, 1, 30, 77056) Finally, they adopted the draft pledge.
('73', 38, 1, 31, 77096) This pledge is seventeen years old.
('73', 38, 1, 32, 77132) Despite this, even today we have not formed such a band of volunteers.
('73', 38, 1, 33, 77203) The pledge has not been annulled by the Congress.
('73', 38, 1, 34, 77253) Our resolution is in the records of the Congress office.
('73', 38, 1, 35, 77310) It must be lying with Kripalani.
('73', 38, 1, 36, 77343) But it lies buried in files.
('73', 38, 1, 37, 77372) In my opinion, not a word from it needs to be eliminated.
('73', 38, 1, 38, 77430) If we had such bands of volunteers at Allahabad or the other places, Hindu Muslim riots would not take place.
('73', 38, 1, 39, 77540) If we had a batch of a thousand volunteers, they could

('73', 39, 1, 2, 77710) go over to a thousand such localities.
('73', 39, 1, 3, 77749) They would carry the sword of truth and the shield of non violence.
('73', 39, 1, 4, 77817) If there are a thousand goondas and if we are alone or only ten, we would go there and die, get killed.
('73', 39, 1, 5, 77921) We are pledged to non violence, Hitlers soldiers go to kill, we go to get killed, as Gupta 1 did.
('73', 39, 1, 6, 78019) I would have preferred him to have died alone.
('73', 39, 1, 7, 78066) Why did he go to find out a Muslim comrade?
('73', 39, 1, 8, 78110) This is not to criticize him.
('73', 39, 1, 9, 78140) This is just a point I am putting before you.
('73', 39, 1, 10, 78186) This is because I claim to be an artist working with non violence.
('73', 39, 1, 11, 78253) I say that Gupta had no need to take along a Muslim with him.
('73', 39, 1, 12, 78315) But then there was only one Gupta.
('73', 39, 1, 13, 78350) The picture that I am painting before you is something far grander.
('73', 39, 1, 14, 78418) Imagine that Sarup moves up in the Allahabad riots and I come to hear that she gets killed while trying to restore peace and that she gets killed without a trace of anger against the peopleI would then dance with joy.
('73', 39, 1, 15, 78636) I would say people have lost their sanity, Sarup has fulfilled her life.
('73', 39, 1, 16, 78709) She got killed.
('73', 39, 1, 17, 78725) If we had ten or twenty thousand such persons, would they not do anything?
('73', 39, 1, 18, 78800) And what if we do not have ten or twenty thousand?
('73', 39, 1, 19, 78851) Even if there is a single person, he should get killed.
('73', 39, 1, 20, 78907) Even if there is only one person who has the faith, he should allow himself to be killed, but should not bow down to the fanatics, the goondas.
('73', 39, 1, 21, 79051) Take the example of Sparta.
('73', 39, 1, 22, 79079) Though they were an armed people and also few, they laid down their lives but would not leave their places.
('73', 39, 1, 23, 79187) We should have much more courage than they had.
('73', 39, 1, 24, 79235) If we think that we cannot accomplish this task without a thousand men, our non violence is not worth the name.
('73', 39, 1, 25, 79347) If we do not have such courage, let us not talk of non violence; let us not defile it.
('73', 39, 1, 26, 79434) Non violence is a weapon against which neither the sword nor any other power can avail.
('73', 39, 1, 27, 79522) Even if there are a crore of people on one side and a single votary of non violence on the other, even then the latter would not say that he would surrender to the might of arms.
('73', 39, 1, 28, 79701) He will demonstrate the fact that poisonous gases and other weapons are futile against non violence.
('73', 39, 1, 29, 79802) He will not bend as did Austria against Hitler.
('73', 39, 1, 30, 79850) It is for this reason that I wish to place before you this [principle].
('73', 39, 1, 31, 79922) It is of primary importance.
('73', 39, 1, 32, 79951) You should understand it and also discuss it here.
('73', 39, 1, 33, 80002) If we put this non violence into practice, Kishore lals task would be lightened.
('73', 39, 1, 34, 80083) First we shall examine our conduct towards one another and see whether we are indeed followers of such non violence.
('73', 39, 1, 35, 80200) And, on the strength of this non violence, we shall also win over the Muslims.

('73', 40, 1, 2, 80379) This is one point I have mentioned to you.
('73', 40, 1, 3, 80422) I have many more in my mind.
('73', 40, 1, 4, 80451) This programme has been with us for the past seventeen years, and we have been sleeping over it with total indifference.
('73', 40, 1, 5, 80572) I have reminded you of it.
('73', 40, 1, 6, 80599) If I am as strong as I am today, I shall appear before you and you can ask questions about it.
('73', 40, 1, 7, 80694) For me this is a very grave matter; my heart is full of it.
('73', 40, 1, 8, 80754) I have direct experience of this kind of non violence.
('73', 40, 1, 9, 80809) If we have been unable to fulfil it during these seventeen long years, the fault lies with me.
('73', 40, 1, 10, 80904) It is my belief that even in politics non violence can work.
('73', 40, 1, 11, 80965) In 1920 I had stated that through non violence we could win swaraj within a year.
('73', 40, 1, 12, 81047) I repeat that had it been an experiment with unadulterated truth and non violence, I am sure a year would have been more than enough.
('73', 40, 1, 13, 81181) If the country and the Congress feel that swaraj cannot be won through non violence, they may well give me up.
('73', 40, 1, 14, 81292) This does not imply that they are ready for violence right now.
('73', 40, 1, 15, 81356) They will make use of truth or untruth, violence or non violence, whatever is possible under the circumstances.
('73', 40, 1, 16, 81468) That, however, will not be my programme.
('73', 40, 1, 17, 81509) If there is truthfulness in you, and if we come to the conclusion that non violence is a weapon of the weak, we ought to throw it away.
('73', 40, 1, 18, 81645) If you are of the opinion that putting down riots by a non violent army is an empty dream, you must also come to the conclusion that swaraj cannot be won through non viol ence.

('73', 41, 2, 3, 81990) DELANG, March 26, 1938
('73', 41, 3, 4, 82013) BAPU: I have not come to tell you anything.
('73', 41, 3, 5, 82057) If anyone of you wants to raise any questions about the point that was made yesterday or about anything else, he may do so.
('73', 41, 3, 6, 82181) Hence I shall not begin a discussion.
('73', 41, 4, 7, 82219) PRESIDENT: Kripalaniji wants to say something about what was discussed yesterday.
('73', 41, 4, 8, 82301) I call upon him to start.
('73', 41, 5, 9, 82327) KRIPALANI: I would like to say something about the riots in Allahabad where two groups were engaged in a clash.
('73', 41, 5, 10, 82439) Together with the police, the Congressmen also rushed to the scene.
('73', 41, 5, 11, 82507) How could the Congressmen or the satyagrahis go where one man was blindly stabbing another?
('73', 41, 5, 12, 82599) How would they know in advance who was going to pull out a knife and at which moment?
('73', 41, 5, 13, 82685) In former days the Hindus at any rate used to listen to the Congress workers.
('73', 41, 5, 14, 82763) As for the Muslims, their hatred of Congressmen exceeds their hatred of Hindus.
('73', 41, 5, 15, 82843) Now when the Congressmen, impelled by sentiments, are risking their lives and getting killed, even the Hindus have started abusing them.
('73', 41, 5, 16, 82980) What I want to know is: have we weighed our policy at all?
('73', 41, 5, 17, 83039) We want to give our lives for the sake of Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 41, 5, 18, 83101) But, if the Muslims slay our great leaders, will the Hindus have more hatred for them or less?
('73', 41, 5, 19, 83196) If a great man sacrifices his life, will the consequences not be exactly the opposite?
('73', 41, 5, 20, 83283) Supposing Bapu sacrifices his life tomorrow, I am sure the Hindus will never forgive the Muslims for the ghastly murder.
('73', 41, 5, 21, 83404) And there will be no Hindu Muslim unity for the next two thousand years.
('73', 41, 5, 22, 83477) What happened to the Jews?
('73', 41, 5, 23, 83504) Even today Christians all over the world despise them for crucifying Christ and persecute them.
('73', 41, 5, 24, 83600) I urge Bapu to consider whether or not one should have a sense of proportion in sacrificing ones life.
('73', 41, 5, 25, 83703) We shall never fulfil our purpose if we act without any thought of the Congressmen.
('73', 41, 6, 26, 83787) BAPU: Kripalani has raised very good points and they deserve your best consideration.
('73', 41, 6, 27, 83873) If we do not or cannot have satisfactory answers to his questions, we must give up non violence as I said yesterday.
('73', 41, 6, 28, 83990) There certainly are solutions to Kripalanis problems even if he or you may not be satisfied with them.
('73', 41, 6, 29, 84093) There is nothing new about the methods adopted in these riots.
('73', 41, 6, 30, 84156) The same thing has been going on for years.
('73', 41, 6, 31, 84200) What is new is that people are stabbed in the streets or under cover of darkness.
('73', 41, 6, 32, 84282) I do not know how the riots started in Allahabad.
('73', 41, 6, 33, 84332) But if they began with two groups of fifty men facing each other, we can certainly do something.
('73', 41, 6, 34, 84429) We can go and stand
('73', 42, 0, 1, 84449) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 43
('73', 42, 1, 2, 84498) between them and allow ourselves to be killed.
('73', 42, 1, 3, 84545) But when the riots give rise to widespread fear in the city, people confine themselves to their own localities.
('73', 42, 1, 4, 84657) This is as good as an invitation to those so inclined to indulge in secret assaults.
('73', 42, 1, 5, 84742) What can we do in the face of such secret assaults?
('73', 42, 1, 6, 84794) This is Kripalanis problem.
('73', 42, 1, 7, 84822) When this method of secret killing is adopted, shops are closed and people do not stir out.
('73', 42, 1, 8, 84914) They avoid going into each others localities.
('73', 42, 1, 9, 84960) Will the poor creatures go there to be killed?
('73', 42, 1, 10, 85007) It is a different thing if one goes out for some very urgent work or inadvertently, or if a Muslim disguises himself to go into a Hindu locality.
('73', 42, 1, 11, 85153) In this case they may get killed.
('73', 42, 1, 12, 85187) But no one goes out in order to get killed.
('73', 42, 1, 13, 85231) No one wants to die.
('73', 42, 1, 14, 85252) My conscience tells me that every Congressman should be trained to go into localities where people run away after stabbing.
('73', 42, 1, 15, 85376) In countries like France and Germany, everyone is required to join the army.
('73', 42, 1, 16, 85453) In these countries the law ordains that people should be prepared to die.
('73', 42, 1, 17, 85527) If we too have such a band [of volunteers] who would be ready to sacrifice their lives during such riots, something could be done about these stabbings, although secret.
('73', 42, 2, 18, 85697) KRIPALANI: Bapuji, it may be so.
('73', 42, 2, 19, 85730) The Congress workers should go into both the localities, and they do go.
('73', 42, 2, 20, 85803) They have done it in Allahabad also.
('73', 42, 2, 21, 85840) But they are not as safe as a Christian can be.
('73', 42, 2, 22, 85888) The question is whether the Congress has developed such strength.
('73', 42, 2, 23, 85954) We have got the courage to die.
('73', 42, 2, 24, 85986) We are not cowards.
('73', 42, 2, 25, 86006) But we are few in number.
('73', 42, 2, 26, 86032) Did not the people who went to the Muslim localities in Allahabad die?
('73', 42, 2, 27, 86103) The goondas did not spare them out of any consideration for the Congress.
('73', 42, 2, 28, 86177) My question is whether the Hindus hatred of Muslims will increase or decrease if Congress workers are killed in this manner.
('73', 42, 3, 29, 86302) BAPU: I merely wanted to show that we have a solution to the problem.
('73', 42, 3, 30, 86372) If a few of our men or many of them are killed that way, it will ultimately serve the purpose.
('73', 42, 3, 31, 86467) My opinion is not baseless.
('73', 42, 3, 32, 86495) I am well aware of the difficulties involved.
('73', 42, 3, 33, 86541) But we must know whether or not we have any solution.
('73', 42, 3, 34, 86595) What do the British, German, French, Italian peoples do?
('73', 42, 3, 35, 86652) They prepare for war in the same manner.
('73', 42, 3, 36, 86693) They keep themselves well equipped to face any new power that may emerge.
('73', 42, 3, 37, 86767) Should we be less alert than these countries?
('73', 42, 3, 38, 86813) Should we not prepare ourselves fully for our non violent struggle?
('73', 42, 3, 39, 86881) Should we sit back and say that we are not strong enough?
('73', 42, 3, 40, 86939) This is not a matter about which we can remain silent.
('73', 42, 3, 41, 86994) It is a new experiment.
('73', 42, 3, 42, 87018) Non violence has not been tried in politics so far.
('73', 42, 3, 43, 87070) Non violence was practised in the olden days too.
('73', 42, 3, 44, 87120) But it always remained a matter of individual pursuit.
('73', 43, 0, 1, 87175) 44 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 43, 1, 2, 87216) people, later on, either fled into the mountains or lived in solitude in the villages.
('73', 43, 1, 3, 87303) They took no interest in the public weal.
('73', 43, 1, 4, 87345) I have started a new trend.
('73', 43, 1, 5, 87373) Non violence, if confined to an individual, cannot be the supreme dharma.
('73', 43, 1, 6, 87447) I at any rate shall not worship a man who practises non violence in a cave.
('73', 43, 1, 7, 87523) Such non violence has no use for me.
('73', 43, 1, 8, 87560) I believe in that non violence which can be practised in the world of practical realities.
('73', 43, 1, 9, 87651) I am not interested in the liberation a man may get by practising non violence after renouncing the world.
('73', 43, 1, 10, 87758) I do not care for individual liberation which would leave others out.
('73', 43, 1, 11, 87828) One can find liberation by serving others.
('73', 43, 1, 12, 87871) That is why I have to come here and explain things to you.
('73', 43, 1, 13, 87930) Now let us have a full understanding of our policy.
('73', 43, 1, 14, 87982) Let us put ourselves to a test.
('73', 43, 1, 15, 88014) We may describe our policy by any other name, but let us at least know what it is.
('73', 43, 1, 16, 88097) If we have come to the conclusion that non violence was useful to us at one time but that it is no longer so, we must make a public declaration of it.
('73', 43, 1, 17, 88248) Let us at any rate not exhibit our inertia and ignorance.
('73', 43, 1, 18, 88306) If we do not decide our policy in all seriousness we would be only betraying ignorance and fear.
('73', 43, 1, 19, 88403) For, in such a situation we would not increase our strength even if we had an army of millions.
('73', 43, 1, 20, 88499) And here, too, what really troubles me is that we would be doing harm to our millions.
('73', 43, 1, 21, 88586) When the real time comes, the people will flee to their villages instead of fighting the danger.
('73', 43, 1, 22, 88683) What worse can happen to our millions?
('73', 43, 1, 23, 88722) Those others who have no faith in non violence will accuse me.
('73', 43, 1, 24, 88785) They accuse me even today.
('73', 43, 1, 25, 88812) They are blaming non violence; they are blaming you.
('73', 43, 1, 26, 88865) They exaggerate so much and say such things as I could not have thought of even in my dreams.
('73', 43, 1, 27, 88959) They say that I have formed a sect.
('73', 43, 1, 28, 88995) They think that the training I am giving in non vio lence has proved very harmful for India.
('73', 43, 1, 29, 89088) And some of them even go to the extent of saying that our real strength does not lie in non violence.
('73', 43, 1, 30, 89190) They say that this passive policy of non violence has ruined us.
('73', 43, 1, 31, 89255) In their view, the man who has done so much harm is as good as a thorn.
('73', 43, 1, 32, 89327) And it would not at all be inconsistent with their policy to remove this thorn.
('73', 43, 1, 33, 89407) I may be exaggerating, but is this not the gist of what they say?
('73', 43, 1, 34, 89473) It is not that I am paying them a compliment.
('73', 43, 1, 35, 89519) My thoughts are the same in public and in private.
('73', 43, 1, 36, 89570) In their place, I would be probably more fiery than they are.
('73', 43, 1, 37, 89632) But I never for a moment think that I am going along the wrong path.
('73', 43, 1, 38, 89701) On the contrary, my faith is confirmed day by day.
('73', 43, 1, 39, 89752) This is no small matter.
('73', 43, 1, 40, 89777) We have a solution for this [problem].
('73', 43, 1, 41, 89816) We have not tried it in full measure.
('73', 43, 1, 42, 89854) The solution is no doubt correct.
('73', 43, 1, 43, 89888) But we have tried it on a very small scale.
('73', 44, 0, 1, 89932) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 45
('73', 44, 1, 2, 89981) We are not practising non violence with conscious understanding.
('73', 44, 1, 3, 90046) Right now, it is our duty to give it a fair trial once again.
('73', 44, 1, 4, 90108) But we at any rate must be confident of our success.
('73', 44, 1, 5, 90161) The test of our success is that no trouble should start from our camp.
('73', 44, 1, 6, 90232) If it does we must admit that we cannot attain swaraj through non violence.
('73', 44, 1, 7, 90308) For us, the freedom struggle consists in the confrontation between the non violent and the violent camps.
('73', 44, 1, 8, 90414) This does not mean that the people on the other side are taking up arms right now.
('73', 44, 1, 9, 90497) They too are brave and are willing to adopt non violent means, as the Communists are.
('73', 44, 1, 10, 90583) They are no less ready to get beaten up by the police.
('73', 44, 1, 11, 90638) But our paths are not the same.
('73', 44, 1, 12, 90670) They might say that they can remain peaceful while fighting with the Government but not in mutual quarrels.
('73', 44, 1, 13, 90778) There are others who may say that they can adopt peaceful methods in the field of politics but not in Hindu Muslim clashes.
('73', 44, 1, 14, 90902) But we cannot talk in such terms.
('73', 44, 1, 15, 90936) For us this problem is as important as the problem of achieving swaraj.
('73', 44, 1, 16, 91008) If non violence can serve no purpose during such riots, we must put it completely out of our minds.
('73', 44, 1, 17, 91108) But I am certain that it can definitely work.
('73', 44, 1, 18, 91154) We are unable to solve the problem because of the third power in the country.
('73', 44, 1, 19, 91232) Hence, [it is said], let us first defeat the third power.
('73', 44, 1, 20, 91290) Let us come to terms till then.
('73', 44, 1, 21, 91322) After that the Hindus and the Muslims will confront each other and decide the issue.
('73', 44, 1, 22, 91407) I have been hearing this since the year 1920. From that time on I have been thinking over the problem.
('73', 44, 1, 23, 91510) I will never accept such a situation.
('73', 44, 1, 24, 91548) It is true that the presence of the third power is one reason for the Hindu Muslim differences.
('73', 44, 1, 25, 91644) But I do not believe that these differences would be resolved merely by eliminating the third power.
('73', 44, 1, 26, 91745) If we have not been able to extinguish [that fire] so far, it is time we searched some new way of doing it.
('73', 44, 1, 27, 91853) I have only one way of attaining independence as well as Hindu Muslim unity, and that is satyagraha.
('73', 44, 1, 28, 91954) We adopted the path of satyagraha against the Government for the attainment of swaraj.
('73', 44, 1, 29, 92041) And we did succeed to some extent.
('73', 44, 1, 30, 92076) We offered the Salt Satyagraha 1 and refused to pay taxes to the Government.
('73', 44, 1, 31, 92153) But we have done almost nothing with regard to this (Hindu Muslim question).
('73', 44, 1, 32, 92230) Whatever we have done is not particularly non violent.
('73', 44, 1, 33, 92285) We have had the Unity Conference.
('73', 44, 1, 34, 92319) We had parleys with Mr. Jinnah.
('73', 44, 1, 35, 92351) We had talks with the Ali Brothers.
('73', 44, 1, 36, 92387) We arrived at a couple of agreements.
('73', 44, 1, 37, 92425) But all these do not go to make the path of non violence.
('73', 44, 1, 38, 92483) All these are political methods.
('73', 44, 1, 39, 92516) And then, they did not even make much headway.
('73', 44, 2, 40, 92563) 1 In 1930
('73', 45, 0, 1, 92573) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 45, 1, 2, 92614) For they were not backed by any real strength.
('73', 45, 1, 3, 92661) We had the Lucknow Pact of 1916. But there has been no agreement of any consequence after that.
('73', 45, 1, 4, 92757) I wrote to Jinnah that I would even go and meet him.
('73', 45, 1, 5, 92810) 1 But what should I do even if I did so?
('73', 45, 1, 6, 92851) Both the Hindus and the Muslims have in their hearts scant respect for the Congress.
('73', 45, 1, 7, 92936) Under the circumstances, how can the agreement be successful?
('73', 45, 1, 8, 92998) If in the event of a riot the goondas on both the sides declare that they would not attack those with white caps, if we ourselves have confidence that the Congress workers would not be attacked, then we may say that we have achieved something.
('73', 45, 1, 9, 93242) This task would be accomplished if we can have a band of one or two thousand workers wedded to non violence.
('73', 45, 1, 10, 93351) And what if we cannot?
('73', 45, 1, 11, 93374) Our success is not solely dependent on numbers.
('73', 45, 1, 12, 93422) Let us now come to the practical side.
('73', 45, 1, 13, 93461) I never do anything without practical considerations, for I am a practical visionary.
('73', 45, 1, 14, 93547) True, there is something in laying down ones life out of sheer devotion to duty.
('73', 45, 1, 15, 93628) But that can be done even by a soldier pledged to violence.
('73', 45, 1, 16, 93688) The reason why I think in practical terms is different.
('73', 45, 1, 17, 93744) It is quite likely that if I go there, or Kishorelal and Kripalani go, or if I am killed, the goondas might get converted.
('73', 45, 1, 18, 93867) I may not even go where this is not likely to happen.
('73', 45, 1, 19, 93921) But those who lay store by faith will say that I am thinking in practical terms, and that I lack faith.
('73', 45, 1, 20, 94025) But one practical consideration is always before us.
('73', 45, 1, 21, 94078) For instance, Vallabhbhai is doing so much work that l would certainly not allow him to go and get killed.
('73', 45, 1, 22, 94185) If I send Manilal, the poor chap will be killed.
('73', 45, 1, 23, 94234) But I will not send Vallabhbhai as long as I can help it.
('73', 45, 1, 24, 94292) I would send others.
('73', 45, 1, 25, 94313) Let us thus carry on work while bearing in mind the practical aspect of it.
('73', 45, 1, 26, 94389) I have some such practical consideration before me.
('73', 45, 1, 27, 94441) If some two thousand outstanding Congress workers have to sacrifice their lives, I shall not think that we were not practical.
('73', 45, 1, 28, 94568) History will not say that we had indulged in madness.
('73', 45, 1, 29, 94622) I would only feel that we had fulfilled our vow.
('73', 45, 1, 30, 94671) I am sure history will testify that non violence is a weapon of the strong, and that we laid down our lives for our cherished principles.
('73', 45, 1, 31, 94809) Such is my undying faith.
('73', 45, 1, 32, 94835) We have been somewhat slack and off our guard.
('73', 45, 1, 33, 94882) That is why we did not recognize the power of non violence.
('73', 45, 1, 34, 94942) For we have not had enough faith in it.
('73', 45, 2, 35, 94982) MATHURA BABU: What will you say in reply to the remark about Jesus Christ?
('73', 45, 3, 36, 95057) 1 Vide Letter to M. A. Jinnah, 8 3 1938
('73', 46, 0, 1, 95097) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 47
('73', 46, 1, 2, 95146) BAPU: Kripalani has put it upside down.
('73', 46, 2, 3, 95186) SWAMI: What measures can we take to put a stop to secret as saults?
('73', 46, 3, 4, 95254) BAPU: I agree this is a very complex problem.
('73', 46, 3, 5, 95300) Since we cannot save others from such assaults, we should get ourselves killed in such cases.
('73', 46, 3, 6, 95394) These assaults do not stop when some people are killed because those people do not deliberately go there to get killed.
('73', 46, 3, 7, 95514) And it is mostly the poor people who are killed.
('73', 46, 3, 8, 95563) How is it that rich and respectable people do not go and get killed?
('73', 46, 3, 9, 95632) It is a different matter if some of them are killed that way without their knowledge.
('73', 46, 3, 10, 95718) We must visit the Muslim localities in the event of such secret assaults and killings.
('73', 46, 3, 11, 95805) We must make it a point particularly to visit the houses of the suspects.
('73', 46, 3, 12, 95879) We may go to Shaukat Ali.
('73', 46, 3, 13, 95905) If he puts the blame on the goondas, we should ask him to accompany us and take out posters against the goondas.
('73', 46, 3, 14, 96018) In the same way I had approached Chhotani 1. The leaders of these goondas are supposed to be powerful, are they not?
('73', 46, 3, 15, 96135) From this point of view, mass contact with the Muslim commu nity acquires a new meaning altogether.
('73', 46, 3, 16, 96235) The real way of making mass contact with the Muslims is that we should seek opportunities to know them and serve them.
('73', 46, 3, 17, 96354) Serving the Muslim masses without any expec tations is the only honourable and effective way of winning their hearts.
('73', 46, 3, 18, 96472) I would like to give it priority even if I have to suspend political work.
('73', 46, 3, 19, 96547) But it is not necessary to stop political work.
('73', 46, 3, 20, 96595) We find easy opportunities of serving and knowing the Muslims.
('73', 46, 3, 21, 96658) For instance, Mahadev and I often travel by trains.
('73', 46, 3, 22, 96710) Often there are Muslim passen gers in the compartment.
('73', 46, 3, 23, 96765) But our people do not talk to them sponta neously.
('73', 46, 3, 24, 96816) We do not offer them our food and other things.
('73', 46, 3, 25, 96864) This is just one instance.
('73', 46, 3, 26, 96891) There are so many other things.
('73', 46, 3, 27, 96923) After hearing this some even amongst you might say that I am talking utter nonsense.
('73', 46, 3, 28, 97008) Those who talk in this manner consider the Muslims as people of a different community.
('73', 46, 3, 29, 97095) But I want to accept them as our own people.
('73', 46, 3, 30, 97140) This is a question of a change of heart on our part.
('73', 46, 3, 31, 97193) How can we express the love and respect that fill our hearts?
('73', 46, 3, 32, 97255) I know there are quite a few Muslims who regard the Hindus as infidels and do not wish to asso ciate with them.
('73', 46, 3, 33, 97367) But all Muslims do not harbour such hatred in their hearts.
('73', 46, 3, 34, 97427) There are enough Muslims who consider the Hindus as their compatriots and believe that it is only by living in amity that both these communities can look after their interests and make progress.

('73', 47, 0, 1, 97665) 48 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 47, 1, 2, 97706) But we should not be frightened even by those Muslims whose hands hold knives and whose hearts are filled with hatred.
('73', 47, 1, 3, 97825) We must win their hearts too, so that even they find it impossible to kill us.
('73', 47, 1, 4, 97904) After all, is it that we alone are human beings and they are not?
('73', 47, 1, 5, 97970) Even they are bound to appreciate human qualities some time.
('73', 47, 1, 6, 98031) They are sure to understand our way some day or the other.
('73', 47, 1, 7, 98090) This is a question of union of hearts.
('73', 47, 1, 8, 98129) Communal trouble may be halted temporarily by means of some political compromise, but that will not bring about unity of hearts.
('73', 47, 1, 9, 98258) I would like to tell each one of you that if there is any such trouble in the villages where you have settled down, you must sacrifice your lives there.
('73', 47, 1, 10, 98411) There is this great difference between me and the socialists.
('73', 47, 1, 11, 98473) They believe in first converting the whole world to their view and then taking up these things.
('73', 47, 1, 12, 98569) Individual action is not part of their programme.
('73', 47, 1, 13, 98619) This is not the way of non violence.
('73', 47, 1, 14, 98656) It can begin with individual action.
('73', 47, 1, 15, 98693) I do not say that my work can start only when I have an army of a thousand workers.
('73', 47, 1, 16, 98777) I live in Segaon.
('73', 47, 1, 17, 98795) Should any such incident happen there, I must plunge into it.
('73', 47, 1, 18, 98857) Wardha is at a distance of five miles from Segaon and quite a large number of Muslims live there.
('73', 47, 1, 19, 98955) If something happens there and suppose Jamna lalji is unmoved, I must go there and jump into it.
('73', 47, 1, 20, 99052) Now, if Kripalani asks me if I have given any practical thought to the matter, I would say that this was my practical consideration.
('73', 47, 1, 21, 99185) Under these circum stances it would be my duty to die even if I were all alone.
('73', 47, 1, 22, 99265) Similarly, this would be the duty of each individual.
('73', 47, 1, 23, 99319) He has to be prepared to die.
('73', 47, 1, 24, 99349) We should not ask whether we shall achieve swaraj by thus allowing ourselves to be killed in communal clashes.
('73', 47, 1, 25, 99460) For us, there is no other way of achieving freedom except through non violence.
('73', 47, 1, 26, 99540) And it is my hope that we are developing that power, unless whatever has been done during these twenty years has been in vain.
('73', 47, 2, 27, 99667) KRIPALANI: To you, non violence may be a matter of individual action and may bring liberation to your own self.
('73', 47, 2, 28, 99779) But you are not content merely with that.
('73', 47, 2, 29, 99821) You consider non violence a means of social service as well.
('73', 47, 2, 30, 99882) Not only this, you consider it also a social force.
('73', 47, 2, 31, 99934) Under such circumstances, you have no right to miscalculate.
('73', 47, 2, 32, 99995) You must understand that you may not do anything from which society cannot benefit.
('73', 47, 2, 33, 100079) You say you should go and allow yourself to be killed.
('73', 47, 2, 34, 100134) But you must remember that if the Muslims so completely lose their heads that they kill you, the Hindus will not forget this thing for the next two thousand years.
('73', 47, 2, 35, 100298) They will regard the Muslims as the enemies of all mankind.
('73', 47, 2, 36, 100358) They may forget this thing after two thousand years and unite, but as far as you are concerned, it cannot be gainsaid that from the point of view of society, you will have done a wrong calculation in thus

('73', 48, 1, 2, 100612) throwing away your life.
('73', 48, 1, 3, 100637) Thus, in all matters we shall have to think out what is going to be our gain or loss.
('73', 48, 2, 4, 100723) KAKASAHEB: When there was trouble in Bombay during the visit of the Prince of Wales 1, you did take a practical view.
('73', 48, 2, 5, 100841) You did not go to persuade the Parsis because you thought that your action would not produce any good results.
('73', 48, 3, 6, 100952) BAPU: I agree that I took a practical view.
('73', 48, 3, 7, 100996) And, like that, I do make such calculations.
('73', 48, 3, 8, 101041) But my calculations too can sometimes go wrong.
('73', 48, 3, 9, 101089) Do I not have a right to commit blunders?
('73', 48, 4, 10, 101131) KRIPALANI: It is not only your right, it is your nature.
('73', 48, 4, 11, 101188) You want to go against nature.
('73', 48, 4, 12, 101219) You have no patience.
('73', 48, 4, 13, 101241) I know that many people will hide their cowardice behind my argument.
('73', 48, 4, 14, 101311) But, for that reason, why should we be foolish enough to sacrifice needlessly so many gallant lives?
('73', 48, 4, 15, 101412) We must think about it from the national point of view.
('73', 48, 5, 16, 101468) KAKASAHEB: But who will decide this matteryou, society or Bapu?
('73', 48, 6, 17, 101532) JAMNALAL: Neither we nor Bapu.
('73', 48, 6, 18, 101563) The nation, that is, the Working Committee will do it.
('73', 48, 7, 19, 101618) KRIPALANL: What I wish to say is that you have written to Jinnah that you do not find the atmosphere [favourable].
('73', 48, 7, 20, 101733) Under such circumstances, if you find yourself alone in the midst of a riot and if it becomes your duty to plunge into it, my only request is that you should not sacrifice your life.
('73', 48, 8, 21, 101916) BAPU: This consideration is irrelevant.
('73', 48, 8, 22, 101956) Please forget me and Jawaharlal.
('73', 48, 8, 23, 101989) You think of your own self and of the country.
('73', 48, 8, 24, 102036) We claim to represent the entire country.
('73', 48, 8, 25, 102078) Millions of Congressmen are ready to die for the country.
('73', 48, 8, 26, 102136) What is their duty?
('73', 48, 8, 27, 102156) The leaders will look after themselves.
('73', 48, 8, 28, 102196) But I am talking to you about the duty of Congressmen in general.
('73', 48, 8, 29, 102262) The instance of Jesus Christ will not be applicable in this case.
('73', 48, 8, 30, 102328) The death of Jesus had no untoward effect on the world.
('73', 48, 8, 31, 102384) Yet another difference is that Jesus did not go to die on his own.
('73', 48, 8, 32, 102451) He was crucified.
('73', 48, 8, 33, 102469) Yet, by his death, his teaching spread far and wide.
('73', 48, 8, 34, 102522) Leave aside all these things.
('73', 48, 8, 35, 102552) Think of it from the individual point of view.
('73', 48, 8, 36, 102599) Social force is something that follows it.
('73', 48, 8, 37, 102642) I have given my example only from that point of view.
('73', 48, 8, 38, 102696) I have not done so with the idea that I am a leader or a general.
('73', 48, 8, 39, 102762) When the occasion arose, I demonstrated my quality of leadership too.
('73', 48, 8, 40, 102832) What I then did was but calculations.
('73', 48, 8, 41, 102870) People were shouting why I was not coming out.
('73', 48, 8, 42, 102917) They were probably calling me a coward too.
('73', 48, 8, 43, 102961) I listened to everything in silence.
('73', 48, 8, 44, 102998) The leader does not think of what other people may be saying.
('73', 48, 8, 45, 103060) I was shouldering at that time the responsibility of leading a movement.
('73', 48, 8, 46, 103133) But now we have to

('73', 49, 0, 1, 103171) 50 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 49, 1, 2, 103212) experiment in sacrificing our lives on a larger scale.
('73', 49, 1, 3, 103267) I have not tried such an experiment so far.
('73', 49, 1, 4, 103311) Whatever happens, cowardice must be discarded.
('73', 49, 1, 5, 103358) Non violence is not for the helpless and the timid.
('73', 49, 1, 6, 103410) That was the reason why I wrote to an Andhra friend that if he could not remain non violent and would die a gallant death, he should fight with physical force.
('73', 49, 1, 7, 103570) Running away is cowardice.
('73', 49, 1, 8, 103597) Even today I feel that I had suggested the correct way to him.
('73', 49, 1, 9, 103660) I have still not tried and seen the result of sacrificing lives on a large scale.
('73', 49, 1, 10, 103742) I wanted to tell him that it was quite plain that battles in the past were fought with the sword.
('73', 49, 1, 11, 103840) What I mean is that I have not tried and tested remedy to prevent this.
('73', 49, 1, 12, 103912) My understanding and my experiences in other fields suggest a remedy which I think will be successful.
('73', 49, 1, 13, 104015) I am not ashamed to acknow ledge my imperfections.
('73', 49, 1, 14, 104066) But I am not so shameless that I would stop with mere acknowledgement.
('73', 49, 1, 15, 104137) I make constant efforts to do away with my imperfections.
('73', 49, 1, 16, 104195) What I am placing before you today is the result of this very effort.
('73', 49, 1, 17, 104265) If your conscience does not accept what I am saying, just forget it.
('73', 49, 1, 18, 104334) You need not hesitate out of respectfor me.
('73', 49, 1, 19, 104378) In the matter of the Hindu Muslim problem, our love will not be proved by argument or physical force.
('73', 49, 1, 20, 104480) If our love proceeds from the heart, ours cannot be the way of the sword.
('73', 49, 1, 21, 104554) We cannot answer abuse with abuse and fists with fists.
('73', 49, 1, 22, 104610) The real test of love lies in sacrificing ourselves and thus answering the lack of love in others.
('73', 49, 1, 23, 104709) The time has now come to try this experiment.
('73', 49, 1, 24, 104755) I have given 1 you a call through Harijan and now personally.
('73', 49, 1, 25, 104817) Consider this from the individual point of view.
('73', 49, 1, 26, 104866) You can discuss it with me if you want and then present it in your own words.
('73', 49, 1, 27, 104944) It is not as if I had tried this experiment and was now presenting it as an infallible remedy.
('73', 49, 2, 28, 105039) JAMNALAL: We must have more discussion on this point.
('73', 49, 2, 29, 105093) The thing is not as simple as Bapuji thinks it to be.
('73', 49, 2, 30, 105147) It must be considered from various points of view.
('73', 49, 2, 31, 105198) Every man cannot be used everywhere.
('73', 49, 2, 32, 105235) We have to have a certain sense of proportion here also.
('73', 49, 2, 33, 105292) Take me, for instance.
('73', 49, 2, 34, 105315) I was present at Banaras when communal violence raged there.
('73', 49, 2, 35, 105376) I had to go into a troubled area for some personal work.
('73', 49, 2, 36, 105433) But my friends prevented me and held me back.
('73', 49, 2, 37, 105479) I was convinced by their arguments.
('73', 49, 2, 38, 105515) And I did not go.
('73', 49, 2, 39, 105533) Now you and I will have to decide whether what I did was right or wrong.

('73', 50, 1, 2, 105776) 42. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING
('73', 50, 2, 3, 105816) DELANG, March 27, 1938 You have just heard the resolution 1. I suppose no one will have any objection to it.
('73', 50, 2, 4, 105925) My task is to caution you on this issue and to explain its implications.
('73', 50, 2, 5, 105998) Am I audible to all of you?
('73', 50, 2, 6, 106026) If you ask me to interpret the resolution, I shall do so.
('73', 50, 2, 7, 106084) This resolution is not for the whole of India.
('73', 50, 2, 8, 106131) It is also not meant for the Working Committee.
('73', 50, 2, 9, 106179) It is meant only for those who have come here.
('73', 50, 2, 10, 106226) And to them I wish to say that wherever they happen to be when a riot breaks out, whether they happen to be alone or in a group, whether they find a co worker or not, they should be prepared to lay down their lives in order to put down the riots wherever they might have started.
('73', 50, 2, 11, 106506) This does not mean that they should simply go and get killed.
('73', 50, 2, 12, 106568) No doubt they should lay down their lives.
('73', 50, 2, 13, 106611) But they must also think whether they are doing so in anger or out of love.
('73', 50, 2, 14, 106687) If they do not have love in their hearts, their laying down their lives is pointless.
('73', 50, 2, 15, 106773) You should try to understand this well.
('73', 50, 2, 16, 106813) I would like to admit before you in all humility that what I say to you is meant also to myself.
('73', 50, 2, 17, 106910) This is because I also keep thinking about what I say to others, what I have done, what its possible implications are, what my duty in the matter is.
('73', 50, 2, 18, 107060) Even while having my meals, while discussing other matters, this issue weighs on my mind.
('73', 50, 2, 19, 107150) Only yesterday, such matters came up before me, which I cannot mention now; and this is not the occasion for it.
('73', 50, 2, 20, 107263) I shall speak of them on some other occasion.
('73', 50, 2, 21, 107309) Today, I cannot even say what we should do in any given situation.
('73', 50, 2, 22, 107376) We should of course be prepared to lay down our lives.
('73', 50, 2, 23, 107431) But our task is not complete with that.
('73', 50, 2, 24, 107471) Our desires and our actions should be based on understanding.
('73', 50, 2, 25, 107533) What is it that inspires us to act?
('73', 50, 2, 26, 107569) What will be its outcome?
('73', 50, 2, 27, 107595) Is this the best
('73', 50, 3, 28, 107612) 1 The resolution on the methods to counteract communal riots is not available.
('73', 50, 3, 29, 107691) It was decided not to pass such a resolution.
('73', 50, 3, 30, 107737) The members, however, were urged .
('73', 50, 3, 31, 107772) to take note of the following statement.
('73', 50, 3, 32, 107813) After considering pujya Bapujis views and the members discussions during the last four days on the subject of communal discord, a consensus was reached that the experience with regard to such strifes was not such as could enable the conference to formulate in the form of a resolution any opinion or scheme.
('73', 50, 3, 33, 108121) However, in the interest of the country, it was imperative to remove communal differences and encourage friendship among the different communities.
('73', 50, 3, 34, 108269) Members of the Sangh should make efforts in this direction following the guidance given by pujya Gandhiji.
('73', 51, 0, 1, 108376) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 51, 1, 2, 108417) possible path?
('73', 51, 1, 3, 108432) Or can there be an even better path?
('73', 51, 1, 4, 108469) That should be our line of thinking.
('73', 51, 1, 5, 108506) It is thus that we can find the right path.
('73', 51, 1, 6, 108550) We should engage ourselves in our work intelligently.
('73', 51, 1, 7, 108604) As I was thinking along these lines, I found that there were many hurdles in our way.
('73', 51, 1, 8, 108690) If you ask me how we can overcome all of these, I can give neither you nor myself a satisfactory answer.
('73', 51, 1, 9, 108795) I would only say that if you believed in these principles you too should experiment with me.
('73', 51, 1, 10, 108888) In that case, we shall certainly find the way.
('73', 51, 1, 11, 108935) This resolution is before you.
('73', 51, 1, 12, 108966) You should give much thought to it and then be prepared to discuss it.
('73', 51, 1, 13, 109037) Because, if we do not wish to give up our tenet of non violence, we should think over what we should do in such a situation and start preparing for it now.
('73', 51, 1, 14, 109193) You do not have merely to pass this resolution, you have also to implement it.
('73', 51, 1, 15, 109272) You have also to create a favourable climate for it.
('73', 51, 1, 16, 109325) You should find a Muslim locality within your field of service and there create such an atmosphere.
('73', 51, 1, 17, 109425) If anything untoward happens in this locality, you should accept the responsibility.
('73', 51, 1, 18, 109510) Every individual cannot make the entire country his field of work.
('73', 51, 1, 19, 109577) After all we have to know our limitations.
('73', 51, 1, 20, 109620) In a city like Bombay you cannot take the responsibility even for the whole city.
('73', 51, 1, 21, 109702) You should find out how many Muslims live in the locality where you happen to reside, get yourself acquainted with them, serve them, and do whatever you can.
('73', 51, 1, 22, 109860) There should not be a single Muslim child whom you do not know.
('73', 51, 1, 23, 109924) We should take each individual Muslim in our locality and build in his mind trust for us.
('73', 51, 1, 24, 110014) If we resolved this issue fully, we shall develop the strength to solve other problems as well, for this is the biggest hurdle in our way.
('73', 51, 1, 25, 110153) A satyagrahi alone can render such service.
('73', 51, 1, 26, 110197) He should specially keep himself in the forefront of such service.
('73', 51, 1, 27, 110264) You may ask what special service he can render.
('73', 51, 1, 28, 110312) If you render sincere service there will be no such incidents in your locality.
('73', 51, 1, 29, 110392) And if such a situation does arise in another locality and if you prepare to go there alone to resolve the dispute, the Muslims in your locality will co operate with you.
('73', 51, 1, 30, 110563) At least they will take care of their own locality.
('73', 51, 1, 31, 110615) You will be able to go to the other localities, and that too with greater courage and confidence.
('73', 51, 1, 32, 110713) Today, I myself do not know how I am going to do all this work.
('73', 51, 1, 33, 110777) I have explained the resolution all right but whom shall I invite to implement it?
('73', 51, 1, 34, 110860) Those whose help is to be sought in this work will have to be trained in self confidence.
('73', 51, 1, 35, 110950) And that by itself will, again, not be sufficient.
('73', 51, 1, 36, 111001) We shall also have to prepare them for the time when they will be tested.
('73', 51, 1, 37, 111075) It is for this reason that I explained to you how we could put this
('73', 52, 0, 1, 111143) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 53
('73', 52, 1, 2, 111192) resolution into practice.
('73', 52, 1, 3, 111218) The second part of my speech deals with a question of the greatest magnitude.
('73', 52, 1, 4, 111296) Let me caution you.
('73', 52, 1, 5, 111316) Think well before you answer.
('73', 52, 1, 6, 111346) I shall put the question to you in brief.
('73', 52, 1, 7, 111388) The question is whether your non violence is that of the brave or of the coward?
('73', 52, 1, 8, 111469) Is it the result of your weakness?
('73', 52, 1, 9, 111504) If it is the result of your lack of strength, I insist you discard it.
('73', 52, 1, 10, 111575) It will cripple and weaken us.
('73', 52, 1, 11, 111606) That certainly is not the aim of non violence.
('73', 52, 1, 12, 111653) This does not mean that I am asking you to take up the sword right now.
('73', 52, 1, 13, 111725) There is a place for non violence in the war strategy of the weak also.
('73', 52, 1, 14, 111797) But such unarmed opposition is not my non violence.
('73', 52, 1, 15, 111849) You may adopt even that.
('73', 52, 1, 16, 111874) But before doing so you will have to renounce the non violence in which I believe.
('73', 52, 1, 17, 111957) Today, you and I bear the burden of this non violence [of the strong].
('73', 52, 1, 18, 112028) If we openly renounce it, we shall relieve ourselves of that burden.
('73', 52, 1, 19, 112097) It is not because we are unarmed that we have adopted this non violence.
('73', 52, 1, 20, 112170) Ours is the non violence of the brave.
('73', 52, 1, 21, 112209) Although I have been experimenting with it for fifty years, I have no cut and dry answers to all the questions.
('73', 52, 1, 22, 112321) When I start thinking what I would have done if I had been in Spain now or in China or Austria, and if Hitler had attacked these countries and I found men and money being drained away, my head starts reeling.
('73', 52, 1, 23, 112530) You may well argue how much the non violence that has made only this much progress even after fifty years experience can help us in our struggle.
('73', 52, 1, 24, 112676) If you think like this, you may give it up.
('73', 52, 1, 25, 112720) For me, there is no question of giving it up.
('73', 52, 1, 26, 112766) My faith in it is unwavering.
('73', 52, 1, 27, 112796) I shall however ever regret that the Lord has not favoured me with such clarity of expression that I could explain my ideas to others.
('73', 52, 1, 28, 112931) I mean ours should not be the non violence of the cowards who are afraid of war, of bloodshed, whose hearts tremble at the shouts of killers.
('73', 52, 1, 29, 113073) Our non violence should be the non violence of the Pathans.
('73', 52, 1, 30, 113133) I have lived with them.
('73', 52, 1, 31, 113157) They are not afraid of killing or getting killed.
('73', 52, 1, 32, 113207) I have cited this example so that I may compare myself to a Pathan boy.
('73', 52, 1, 33, 113279) A Pathan boy is fearless.
('73', 52, 1, 34, 113305) If there is bloodshed he does not hide himself in his house.
('73', 52, 1, 35, 113366) He finds pleasure in fighting.
('73', 52, 1, 36, 113397) He does not stop to think that he might be injured or even killed.
('73', 52, 1, 37, 113464) He is never afraid of being hurt.
('73', 52, 1, 38, 113498) I have seen one standing unmoved in the midst of blood gushing from his many wounds.
('73', 52, 1, 39, 113583) I do not mean to say that all Pathans are like this.
('73', 52, 1, 40, 113636) But I have seen such Pathans with my own eyes.
('73', 52, 1, 41, 113683) What I wish to say is that experimenting with non violence is the work of
('73', 53, 0, 1, 113757) 54 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 53, 1, 2, 113798) such brave persons.
('73', 53, 1, 3, 113818) I myself have not yet reached this stage.
('73', 53, 1, 4, 113860) There is lot of cowardice in me.
('73', 53, 1, 5, 113893) I talk of satyagraha, no doubt.
('73', 53, 1, 6, 113925) But in the face of killings I cannot have the fearlessness of the Pathans.
('73', 53, 1, 7, 114000) If I have to go and face such a situation, my hearts one wish would be to escape alive.
('73', 53, 1, 8, 114088) If per force I do go, my heartbeats would quicken.
('73', 53, 1, 9, 114139) And, in my heart of hearts I would be afraid lest a bullet or a stone should hit me.
('73', 53, 1, 10, 114224) I reached Bombay (in 1921) when the riots were raging.
('73', 53, 1, 11, 114279) Stones were being hurled.
('73', 53, 1, 12, 114305) I wanted to save myself from the melee, but what could I do?
('73', 53, 1, 13, 114366) I was the leader of the non co operation movement.
('73', 53, 1, 14, 114417) I went in most unwillingly.
('73', 53, 1, 15, 114445) At heart, I wished someone asked me to stay at home; that would have indeed been welcome.
('73', 53, 1, 16, 114535) When I reached there the people were in a frenzy.
('73', 53, 1, 17, 114585) Anasuyabehn was with me.
('73', 53, 1, 18, 114610) She is a brave woman.
('73', 53, 1, 19, 114632) Who was I to protect her?
('73', 53, 1, 20, 114658) People had lost their heads.
('73', 53, 1, 21, 114687) I saw mounted policemen advancing towards us.
('73', 53, 1, 22, 114733) At the most, there must have been forty of them, but they were advancing with such uncon cern as though there was not a man on the road.
('73', 53, 1, 23, 114870) They were followed by officers in their cars.
('73', 53, 1, 24, 114916) My heart trembled.
('73', 53, 1, 25, 114935) We wanted to go to the Fort area.
('73', 53, 1, 26, 114969) We reached Abdul Rehman Street via Pydhonie.
('73', 53, 1, 27, 115014) There was heavy fighting in the area.
('73', 53, 1, 28, 115052) My heart was thumping.
('73', 53, 1, 29, 115075) I do not know how high the blood pressure rose.
('73', 53, 1, 30, 115123) As soon as the mounted police and army officers arrived the people who were till now in a riotous mood ran helter skelter.
('73', 53, 1, 31, 115246) I do not wish to take up your time narrating the whole incident.
('73', 53, 1, 32, 115311) My idea is to tell you that you should give some thought to this.
('73', 53, 1, 33, 115377) I have spoken of my own cowardice.
('73', 53, 1, 34, 115412) But those who were brandishing knives and sticks turned out to be no braver.
('73', 53, 1, 35, 115489) I have compared my own courage with a Pathans.
('73', 53, 1, 36, 115536) Non violence is the weapon of such fearless persons full of courage.
('73', 53, 1, 37, 115605) This will show clearly how I should experiment.
('73', 53, 1, 38, 115653) If there is real love in my heart and a feeling of oneness, why should I feel nervous to go there?
('73', 53, 1, 39, 115752) Why did my heart thump so?
('73', 53, 1, 40, 115779) This clearly implies that even in me the feeling of non violence has not grown to the extent that would make me fearless and free of doubts.
('73', 53, 1, 41, 115920) Fearlessness born of love is the general characteristic of non violence.
('73', 53, 1, 42, 115993) If it is not yet born in our hearts, this experiment is for that very purpose.
('73', 53, 1, 43, 116072) While carrying on this experiment, we shall acquire the strength to face death smilingly.
('73', 53, 1, 44, 116162) But we have fallen into complacency.
('73', 53, 1, 45, 116199) When there is peace on all fronts we do not prepare ourselves for such eventualities.
('73', 53, 1, 46, 116285) And when the occasion arises we do not know what to do.
('73', 53, 1, 47, 116341) If we do not wish to try this experiment whole heartedly and in all seriousness, I humbly request you to give it up.
('73', 53, 1, 48, 116458) I also wish to point out to you that mere
('73', 54, 0, 1, 116500) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 55
('73', 54, 1, 2, 116549) debating will not resolve the issue.
('73', 54, 1, 3, 116586) Open discussions do clear up our reasoning to some extent.
('73', 54, 1, 4, 116645) It is true that on the question of non violence also we shall have to exercise our reasoning till the last.
('73', 54, 1, 5, 116753) But I must tell you that non violence is not a matter solely of the intellect.
('73', 54, 1, 6, 116832) It is a matter of faith and devotion.
('73', 54, 1, 7, 116870) If you have no faith in the atman or in God and prayer, non violence is not going to prove useful to you.
('73', 54, 1, 8, 116976) If it is in fact the supreme dharma, as we believe it is, then it must work on every occasion and at every place.
('73', 54, 1, 9, 117090) It has so much potentiality.
('73', 54, 1, 10, 117119) If we cannot recognize it the fault lies with us.
('73', 54, 1, 11, 117169) Realizing the whole range of the power of non violence or having a vision of its whole power depends on our spiritual effort.
('73', 54, 1, 12, 117295) If you are convinced of it and, after striving for 17 years, if you have developed this faith that whether or not we win swaraj, that irrespective of what happens to the world, we have achieved this one thing, you should try it intelligently.
('73', 54, 1, 13, 117538) Your knowledge will grow with your sadhana.
('73', 54, 1, 14, 117582) But you will not become omniscient.
('73', 54, 1, 15, 117618) God alone is omniscient.
('73', 54, 1, 16, 117643) He is not so stupid as to let all become omniscient and omnipotent.
('73', 54, 1, 17, 117711) Thanks to our imperfections we can still aspire to it.
('73', 54, 1, 18, 117766) God has assured us that when we realize our weakness and take refuge in Him, He is with us.
('73', 54, 1, 19, 117858) The bhajan Rama is the strength of the weak, is not a versification of some music teacher; it is a factual statement by someone who had experienced it.
('73', 54, 1, 20, 118010) If you have any doubts or hesitation you should not pass this resolution.
('73', 54, 1, 21, 118084) Take at least one night to think over it.
('73', 54, 1, 22, 118126) Pray to God to enlighten your intellect.
('73', 54, 1, 23, 118167) This is not a resolution to be passed by a majority.
('73', 54, 1, 24, 118220) Even if a single member amongst you stands up and says that he does not have this faith, he still has the right to tread the path of non violence.
('73', 54, 1, 25, 118367) You should certainly not pass it by a majority.
('73', 54, 1, 26, 118415) Now let us come to Jamnalaljis question.
('73', 54, 1, 27, 118456) If we, who are mem bers of the Gandhi Seva Sangh, accept ministerships, can we order firing?
('73', 54, 1, 28, 118549) Today, in Allahabad Govind Ballabh Pant is a Minister.
('73', 54, 1, 29, 118604) He is not a member of our Sangh.
('73', 54, 1, 30, 118637) But is he for that reason less non violent than we?
('73', 54, 1, 31, 118689) I know him very well.
('73', 54, 1, 32, 118711) But what could the poor man do?
('73', 54, 1, 33, 118743) I want to tell you that had I been in his place I would have acted similarly.
('73', 54, 1, 34, 118821) When I accept ministership, I take the responsibility for peace and honest administration.
('73', 54, 1, 35, 118912) Of course, I could think this matter over before accepting the ministership.
('73', 54, 1, 36, 118989) But I cannot ask any member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh not to accept ministership solely on this account.
('73', 54, 1, 37, 119093) I am aware that this would mean lowering of my standard.
('73', 55, 0, 1, 119150) 56 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 55, 1, 2, 119191) But after all my non violence cannot deviate from what is practical.
('73', 55, 1, 3, 119260) I wish to work through non violence while yet solving the problems of everyday life.
('73', 55, 1, 4, 119345) If while I am a Minister Hindus and Muslims start fighting amongst themselves, and if I realize that I can stop this vio lence and bloodshed by calling in the army and having a handful of men shot, I would have to resort to this course for the sake of restoring order.
('73', 55, 1, 5, 119614) I will have to give orders to stop the massacre with the least violence.
('73', 55, 1, 6, 119687) I am opening my heart to you in order to explain all this to you.
('73', 55, 1, 7, 119753) If outsiders hear what I am saying, I cannot say what interpretations they will put on it.
('73', 55, 1, 8, 119844) There must be journalists present here, but they do not know their profession.
('73', 55, 1, 9, 119923) They should not be cross with me, I too have been a journalist, and I too have experience of reporting.
('73', 55, 1, 10, 120027) But these people do not wait to discriminate between fact and fiction since they must fill up a page and create a sensation.
('73', 55, 1, 11, 120152) Hence I wish to state rather plainly that not a word from what I say shall go out.
('73', 55, 1, 12, 120235) Well, this was a digression.
('73', 55, 1, 13, 120264) Now visualize Pants position.
('73', 55, 1, 14, 120294) The Hindus and Muslims of his city have lost their heads.
('73', 55, 1, 15, 120352) They are butchering each other.
('73', 55, 1, 16, 120384) Life and property are not safe.
('73', 55, 1, 17, 120416) What then shall he say?
('73', 55, 1, 18, 120440) Should he say to himself that although he is a votary of non violence he sees no non violent way of facing this situation?
('73', 55, 1, 19, 120563) He examines the doctrine of non violence, but finds it silent over the pointbut he does have in his hands brute force; hence he should take recourse to it.
('73', 55, 1, 20, 120719) He does not lack manliness, so he will not remain passive.
('73', 55, 1, 21, 120778) He would again seek the help of non violence and not use brute force.
('73', 55, 1, 22, 120848) But if such an occasion arises again and he does not find a non violent way, he should again act in the same manner.
('73', 55, 1, 23, 120965) Pant should publicly declare that non violence did not avail; the people did not help him and all the same they have made him a Minister.
('73', 55, 1, 24, 121103) He should therefore do whatever suggests itself to him.
('73', 55, 1, 25, 121159) You must have understood my point.
('73', 55, 1, 26, 121194) It is now needless to discuss the issue any further.
('73', 55, 1, 27, 121247) If you wish to ask any other questions please do so.
('73', 55, 2, 28, 121300) Seven minutes are left.
('73', 55, 2, 29, 121324) Let me answer Rajendra Babus question in the mean time.
('73', 55, 2, 30, 121380) His point, as far as I can understand, is this: I now know all of you.
('73', 55, 2, 31, 121451) Knowing you as you are, I should put something before you
('73', 55, 3, 32, 121509) 1 Rajendra Prasad then asked how the problem could be solved in the pre vailing atmosphere of violence, while even members of the Sangh were no strong enough to try non violence even though they might be convinced of its efficacy.
('73', 56, 0, 1, 121740) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 57
('73', 56, 1, 2, 121789) which you can do.
('73', 56, 1, 3, 121807) Even if you thought for the whole night or, for that matter, for ten nights, you cannot know yourselves better than I know you.
('73', 56, 1, 4, 121935) Hence I should put before you the minimum that I want.
('73', 56, 1, 5, 121990) This is his question.
('73', 56, 1, 6, 122012) I have already shown the remedy.
('73', 56, 1, 7, 122045) Rajendra Babu has said that even if we thought for ten nights we shall make no progress.
('73', 56, 1, 8, 122134) Yet I would again ask you to think all night.
('73', 56, 1, 9, 122180) Tell me tomorrow if you can.
('73', 56, 1, 10, 122209) For this I may start my silence earlier today and break it earlier tomorrow, so that after thinking it over all night you can discuss it tomorrow.
('73', 56, 1, 11, 122356) My point about cautioning you is to be found in the second part of my speech.
('73', 56, 1, 12, 122434) In the first part I mentioned the minimum that you can do.
('73', 56, 1, 13, 122493) I have said that we should increase our contacts with the Muslims in our village or locality in a spirit of service.
('73', 56, 1, 14, 122610) We should widen our circle of Muslim friends.
('73', 56, 1, 15, 122656) We should serve them with sincerity and not by flattering them.
('73', 56, 1, 16, 122720) If they ask us to get this or that for them we should refuse to do so.
('73', 56, 1, 17, 122791) We should apply our reasoning, cast off our fears and without flattering them go on doing what we regard as our duty.
('73', 56, 1, 18, 122909) For instance, we should gather Muslim boys and give them milk; even if their parents have suspicions, I should like to prove through my conduct that I was not doing this in order to convert them to Hinduism.
('73', 56, 1, 19, 123117) Gradually their suspicion will be removed.
('73', 56, 1, 20, 123160) At least we shall come to know the boys.
('73', 56, 1, 21, 123201) Now suppose a riot breaks out in the mean time.
('73', 56, 1, 22, 123249) In that case after this experience we can go into that locality without fear.
('73', 56, 1, 23, 123327) I have in this matter less experience but more faith.
('73', 56, 1, 24, 123381) And now I have also lost my strength.
('73', 56, 1, 25, 123419) Had it not been for this reason I would not be sitting like a fool doing nothing.
('73', 56, 1, 26, 123501) Take up one locality and try the experiment.
('73', 56, 1, 27, 123546) Nevertheless I must say one thing.
('73', 56, 1, 28, 123581) If you carry out this experiment your self confidence will grow a hundred fold.
('73', 56, 1, 29, 123661) You will know your strength.
('73', 56, 1, 30, 123690) We have only one weapon and that is non violence.
('73', 56, 1, 31, 123740) will be applied extensively and in many ways you will think of putting this remedy to many other uses.
('73', 56, 1, 32, 123843) As you tread the path of non violence, new weapons will come into your hands of which I am not aware.

('73', 57, 4, 7, 124242) Anasuyas 1 letter is typical of her.
('73', 57, 4, 8, 124279) She seemed at one time to be satisfied with what had happened.

('73', 57, 4, 20, 124669) It wont do to pamper him.
('73', 57, 4, 21, 124695) I am hoping that your judgment about him would prove true.
('73', 57, 4, 22, 124754) Your previous letter disturbed me a bit.
('73', 57, 4, 23, 124795) You will neither be hasty nor dejected over the result of your efforts in the villages.
('73', 57, 4, 24, 124883) It is an uphill task especially when it has to be done through paid agency.

('73', 59, 11, 23, 127648) BHANSALI, I hope you are doing well.
('73', 59, 11, 24, 127685) You will be glad to learn that these days while I do my sacrificial spinning the yarn rarely snaps.
('73', 59, 11, 25, 127785) Of course, it does surprise me.
('73', 59, 11, 26, 127817) You also should try to spin even, strong and unbroken yarn, though the quantity may be less, instead of spin ning much and for many hours.
('73', 59, 11, 27, 127956) It is good that you are taking the injections.
('73', 59, 11, 28, 128003) Let us hope that will put you right.

('73', 60, 3, 4, 128203) AMRITLAL, I have already sent the answers to your questions.
('73', 60, 3, 5, 128264) Try to discover why you keep good health in Bombay without any effort while you barely manage to do so in Segaon.
('73', 60, 3, 6, 128378) Is the cause psycho logical or external?
('73', 60, 3, 7, 128419) If it is external, is it the food and water or the climate, or both?
('73', 60, 3, 8, 128488) If it is food, you can eat the same food in Segaon as you do in Bombay.
('73', 60, 3, 9, 128560) If the reason is psychological, [the cure] is in your own hands.
('73', 60, 3, 10, 128625) If it is the climate and water, we are helpless.
('73', 60, 3, 11, 128674) But I dont think that they count so much.
('73', 60, 3, 12, 128716) The date of my return will be decided in Calcutta.

('73', 60, 8, 17, 128884) SHARDA, Today is my Silence Day.
('73', 60, 8, 18, 128917) And I also have some time.
('73', 60, 8, 19, 128944) It is pretty hot here.
('73', 60, 8, 20, 128967) We are a goodly company.
('73', 60, 8, 21, 128992) Ba, Lilavati, Manilal and his wife Sushila are with me.
('73', 60, 8, 22, 129048) Kanti has come from Bangalore.
('73', 60, 8, 23, 129079) Your letter should have arrived here.
('73', 60, 8, 24, 129117) It has not yet arrived.
('73', 60, 8, 25, 129141) It may come tomorrow.
('73', 60, 8, 26, 129163) We shall reach Calcutta on the 1st or maybe on the 31st.
('73', 60, 8, 27, 129220) My health has been good so far.
('73', 60, 8, 28, 129252) I have cut down my intake of food.
('73', 60, 8, 29, 129287) Now the blood pressure has come to 160 96. Prabhavati has gone to Patna, Amtul Salaam to Bombay.

('73', 61, 1, 2, 129519) 50. SPEECH AT GANDHI SEVA SANGH MEETING
('73', 61, 2, 3, 129559) DELANG, March 28, 1938 Having heard the discussion we have had now and Kishorelals brief report of the discussion in the afternoonhaving heard it all I have come to the conclusion that this proposal should not be put before you.
('73', 61, 2, 4, 129788) You should not conclude that this is a result of the argument advanced by a few friends.
('73', 61, 2, 5, 129877) The discussion I heard here has also left the same impression on me.
('73', 61, 2, 6, 129946) This does not mean that those who have faith in this may not act upon it.
('73', 61, 2, 7, 130020) It only means that in this matter I do not wish to force anyone.
('73', 61, 2, 8, 130085) But I certainly insist upon the principle underlying this proposal.
('73', 61, 2, 9, 130153) It is not something unnatural.
('73', 61, 2, 10, 130184) If you have understood my point it will gain weight when you act upon it and carry it out according to your capacity.
('73', 61, 2, 11, 130302) [Passing] a resolution will not by itself suffice.
('73', 61, 2, 12, 130353) Take [for instance] Jamnalaljis suggestion.
('73', 61, 2, 13, 130397) He says that so long as Muslims do not become members of our Gandhi Seva Sangh, it will be futile to make efforts in this direction.
('73', 61, 2, 14, 130530) What he says is true but we shall find the correct remedy after we have served them and our action has borne fruit in the form of a closer contact with the Muslims.
('73', 61, 2, 15, 130695) Of what good will it be if one or two persons become members reluctantly?
('73', 61, 2, 16, 130769) We shall achieve something only when our relationship with the Muslims becomes that of the servant and those whom he serves.
('73', 61, 2, 17, 130894) So far the Congress has been doing what Jamnalalji suggests.
('73', 61, 2, 18, 130955) What it did was good, no doubt.
('73', 61, 2, 19, 130987) They got many Muslims enrolled as members.
('73', 61, 2, 20, 131030) But they had to be coaxed into becoming members.
('73', 61, 2, 21, 131079) This is a kind of flattery, or you may call it a politically motivated policy.
('73', 61, 2, 22, 131158) What I have said today is not for political reasons, although it may well have a welcome political outcome.
('73', 61, 2, 23, 131266) Today I place it before you solely from the standpoint of non vio lence.
('73', 61, 2, 24, 131339) If we are really experimenting with the non violence of the strong, we ought to make an effort to bring about friendship between Hindus and Muslims.
('73', 61, 2, 25, 131488) So far there has been no friendship.
('73', 61, 2, 26, 131525) It was only an attempt to win them over through flattery.
('73', 61, 2, 27, 131583) There was a policy behind all that.
('73', 61, 2, 28, 131619) We maintained friendly relations merely from a practical point of view; it was like a businessmans practical policy.
('73', 61, 2, 29, 131736) So far we have not put our non violence to the test in regard to this issue.
('73', 61, 2, 30, 131813) If today we can take this test in non violence and pass it, we shall move a thousand steps forward on the path of winning freedom
('73', 62, 0, 1, 131943) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 63
('73', 62, 1, 2, 131992) through non violent means.
('73', 62, 1, 3, 132019) If you really believe that swaraj cannot be won without non violence, you will also have to admit that our non violent means will not be effective without Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 62, 1, 4, 132194) As I delve deeper into this question many things come up before me.
('73', 62, 1, 5, 132262) After all I am being guided by my intellect, am I not?
('73', 62, 1, 6, 132317) Nowadays, I am relying solely on my intellect.
('73', 62, 1, 7, 132364) But mere intellect makes one insane or unmanly.
('73', 62, 1, 8, 132412) That is its function.
('73', 62, 1, 9, 132434) In such a situation Rama is the strength of the weak.
('73', 62, 1, 10, 132488) My innermost urge is for pure non violence.
('73', 62, 1, 11, 132532) My weakness is that I do not know how to make it work.
('73', 62, 1, 12, 132587) I use my intellect to overcome that weakness.
('73', 62, 1, 13, 132633) If this intellectual cleverness loses the support of truth, it will blur my vision of non violence, for is not non violence the same as truth?
('73', 62, 1, 14, 132776) Mere practical sense is but a covering for truth.
('73', 62, 1, 15, 132826) The face of truth is hidden by a golden lid. 1 The reasoning faculty will raise a thousand issues.
('73', 62, 1, 16, 132925) Only one thing will save us from these and that is faith.
('73', 62, 1, 17, 132983) Hence Gangadharrao said that he did not feel weak.
('73', 62, 1, 18, 133034) For him, the argument of weakness is hollow.
('73', 62, 1, 19, 133079) But others have doubts whether non violence can accomplish this.
('73', 62, 1, 20, 133144) Kripalani had raised the doubt about what policy we could adopt where there are secret attacks on individuals.
('73', 62, 1, 21, 133255) This is a kind of guerilla warfare as Prabhudas called it.
('73', 62, 1, 22, 133314) There was in Banaras nothing but peace.
('73', 62, 1, 23, 133354) In Sarnath however four Hindus were done to death.
('73', 62, 1, 24, 133405) Now how can our non violence help in such a situation?
('73', 62, 1, 25, 133460) I say, think a little deeper.
('73', 62, 1, 26, 133490) This is but a part of our war strategy.
('73', 62, 1, 27, 133530) You despair that no friendship will help there.
('73', 62, 1, 28, 133578) I tell you it certainly will.
('73', 62, 1, 29, 133608) It is not that a handful of persons have lost their sanity.
('73', 62, 1, 30, 133668) Its root lies in the fact that the atmosphere is vitiated.
('73', 62, 1, 31, 133727) But then I cannot say right now how far it can be purified through our service.
('73', 62, 1, 32, 133807) You must not reduce your service to a bargain.
('73', 62, 1, 33, 133854) Non violence cannot work in this way.
('73', 62, 1, 34, 133892) In the case of non violence we on our part start acting without any doubts.
('73', 62, 1, 35, 133968) Take the instance of April 6, 1919 2 Where were the Congress Committees then?
('73', 62, 1, 36, 134046) We announced a proposal.
('73', 62, 1, 37, 134071) Millions responded to our call.
('73', 62, 1, 38, 134103) Tell me how this could have happened.
('73', 62, 1, 39, 134141) Everyone felt as if a miracle had occurred.
('73', 62, 1, 40, 134185) People thought that at the bottom of all this there must have been a mighty scheme, but there had been no such thing.
('73', 62, 1, 41, 134303) However, it was certainly supported by a lot of prayer.
('73', 62, 1, 42, 134359) The same thing happened in the case of the Dandi March.
('73', 62, 1, 43, 134415) Who had organized and planned it?
('73', 62, 1, 44, 134449) I myself was not aware of
('73', 62, 2, 45, 134475) 1 Ishopanishad, 15 2 Directions to Demostrations, 5 4 1919
('73', 63, 0, 1, 134534) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 63, 1, 2, 134575) anything.
('73', 63, 1, 3, 134585) There was faith and nothing else.
('73', 63, 1, 4, 134619) I too did not know what God would do.
('73', 63, 1, 5, 134657) I had only the faith that it would all turn out as it did.
('73', 63, 1, 6, 134716) You have evidence that I had no clear idea of it.
('73', 63, 1, 7, 134766) I do not know how it all really happened.
('73', 63, 1, 8, 134808) This is how non violence works.
('73', 63, 1, 9, 134840) Today, we think of our weakness.
('73', 63, 1, 10, 134873) Actually, it is not our weakness.
('73', 63, 1, 11, 134907) The fact is that we have no faith in non violence.
('73', 63, 1, 12, 134958) This lack of faith makes us doubt whether non violence can solve the problem.
('73', 63, 1, 13, 135036) Millions have this faith in the matter of swaraj.
('73', 63, 1, 14, 135086) But with regard to Hindu Muslim unity we find not even a thousand such persons.
('73', 63, 1, 15, 135166) What we need is that we should have faith in non violence not merely as a means to swaraj, but independently as well.
('73', 63, 1, 16, 135284) Whether we win swaraj through non violence or not, we must achieve Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 63, 1, 17, 135371) For us, it is not a means to swaraj.
('73', 63, 1, 18, 135408) I have not been able even to create the climate for it.
('73', 63, 1, 19, 135464) Not even a thousand persons share my views on this question.
('73', 63, 1, 20, 135525) Just as I say that I do not want swaraj if it is to be won through untruth and violence, today I would also say that I do not want swaraj without Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 63, 1, 21, 135691) I say this because I want that in independent India Hindus should not suppress Muslims, nor Muslims Hindus.
('73', 63, 1, 22, 135799) I want to see that all are equal.
('73', 63, 1, 23, 135833) You may perhaps find this aspect of the problem rather new.
('73', 63, 1, 24, 135893) If this is something new for you, so is it for me.
('73', 63, 1, 25, 135944) I can see no straight way in front of me.
('73', 63, 1, 26, 135986) There is total darkness ahead.
('73', 63, 1, 27, 136017) Despite this, I have.
('73', 63, 1, 28, 136039) the confidence that if I go forward with faith, I shall certainly reach my destination.
('73', 63, 1, 29, 136127) If you realize this, you should start working on this even without a resolution.
('73', 63, 1, 30, 136208) In a way this problem is even more difficult than that of swaraj.
('73', 63, 1, 31, 136274) Millions of people today aspire for swaraj.
('73', 63, 1, 32, 136318) Not even a handful of people care for Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 63, 1, 33, 136376) We will have to solve this problem independently.
('73', 63, 1, 34, 136426) There are many difficulties because we seek the welfare of the Muslims while serving them.
('73', 63, 1, 35, 136517) We do not want to encourage their selfishness by pampering them.
('73', 63, 1, 36, 136582) Take for instance the incident cited by Prabhudas.
('73', 63, 1, 37, 136633) I totally disapprove of what he did.
('73', 63, 1, 38, 136670) If a Muslim zamindar insists that the Hindus should not celebrate Holi, should I ask the Hindus to agree to it simply because these poor people listen to me?
('73', 63, 1, 39, 136828) I will certainly not do it.
('73', 63, 1, 40, 136856) You may say that to celebrate Holi would be suicidal.
('73', 63, 1, 41, 136910) I would tell the Hindus that they should not give up their religious practice on this account.
('73', 63, 1, 42, 137005) I would myself ask the zamindar to come forward and kill me, for I would light the Holi fire right in front of him.
('73', 63, 1, 43, 137121) I would ask the Hindus not to break the heads of Muslims, but rather to sacrifice their own.
('73', 63, 1, 44, 137214) We shall give up nothing through fear.
('73', 63, 1, 45, 137253) I shall certainly do what I have a right to do and what I
('73', 64, 0, 1, 137311) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 65
('73', 64, 1, 2, 137360) If I have to fight for this, I shall do so in a non violent manner.
('73', 64, 1, 3, 137428) I went to make friends with Jinnah Saheb.
('73', 64, 1, 4, 137470) But if for this reason I allow myself to be suppressed and do not fulfil my duty, it is no friendship.
('73', 64, 1, 5, 137573) This is not a new approach.
('73', 64, 1, 6, 137601) The important thing is that service should be the basis of friendship, and no other motive or self interest as was the case with my childhood friendship.
('73', 64, 1, 7, 137755) The friendship which I had then formed with the Muslim boy 1 was for the sake of meat eating and ended with it.
('73', 64, 1, 8, 137867) But today, I am asking you you who make friends with the idea of service and who with your mature intellect believe in atman and Paramatmanto serve them.
('73', 64, 1, 9, 138021) Such friendship will result in unity.
('73', 64, 1, 10, 138059) Now the question of girls.
('73', 64, 1, 11, 138086) What should they do?
('73', 64, 1, 12, 138107) Should they be scared at the sight of Muslims?
('73', 64, 1, 13, 138154) That ought not to be.
('73', 64, 1, 14, 138176) But it does not follow that they should enter the fray at the time of riots or become the victims of secret attacks as a matter of dharma.
('73', 64, 1, 15, 138315) Of course, if there is a girl like Mridula it is another matter.
('73', 64, 1, 16, 138380) She is not afraid of anyone.
('73', 64, 1, 17, 138409) She does not care even if the Muslims kill her.
('73', 64, 1, 18, 138457) Girls who are self confident should go in.
('73', 64, 1, 19, 138500) But those who are afraid, who lack this self confidence, who do not have a strong heart should not go there.
('73', 64, 1, 20, 138609) But the man of doubt is lost. 2 If I am overcome by doubt I will hardly touch a serpent.
('73', 64, 1, 21, 138698) Women who have doubts must never come out before Muslims.
('73', 64, 1, 22, 138756) I know of many such instances.
('73', 64, 1, 23, 138787) I tried to tell you about this in a way you would understand.
('73', 64, 1, 24, 138849) You should not feel that the whole discussion has been futile.
('73', 64, 1, 25, 138912) My mind too has become clear.
('73', 64, 1, 26, 138942) You have drawn my attention to several difficulties.
('73', 64, 1, 27, 138995) In spite of them, after this discussion, I am even more strongly convinced that this is what we should do and shall have to do.
('73', 64, 1, 28, 139123) Let us not form any committee and so on.
('73', 64, 1, 29, 139164) Each one is a committee by himself.
('73', 64, 1, 30, 139200) Each is his own leader and his own soldier.
('73', 64, 1, 31, 139244) The servant is himself the master.
('73', 64, 1, 32, 139279) Where the climate does not exist, what is the use of forming committees?
('73', 64, 1, 33, 139352) When the time comes we will lose our heads.
('73', 64, 1, 34, 139396) The real thing is to keep our headsour reasoningclear.
('73', 64, 1, 35, 139451) There is no question of any confrontation.
('73', 64, 1, 36, 139494) Dastane asks me to appoint someone for the task.
('73', 64, 1, 37, 139543) This is not a matter to be dealt with in this way.
('73', 64, 1, 38, 139594) In the same matter what may be dharma for one person may be its opposite for another.
('73', 64, 1, 39, 139680) Let us not betray our souls.
('73', 64, 1, 40, 139709) Let us not corrupt our

('73', 65, 1, 2, 139883) intellect.
('73', 65, 1, 3, 139894) If we wish to strive for non violence we should follow the yamas and niyamas 1. This advice of our forefathers is absolutely correct.
('73', 65, 1, 4, 140028) I am not placing anything new before you.
('73', 65, 1, 5, 140070) I shall show what strength underlies our forefathers advice.
('73', 65, 1, 6, 140131) I have derived this from their own books.
('73', 65, 1, 7, 140173) We cannot observe ahimsa without fulfilling the vows.
('73', 65, 1, 8, 140227) This does not mean that whoever is morally depraved and given to drinking commits violence.
('73', 65, 1, 9, 140319) But then it is certain that he does not sincerely observe non violence.
('73', 65, 1, 10, 140391) We must examine everything from this standpoint, viz., whether it helps or hinders non violence.
('73', 65, 1, 11, 140488) I too can drink alcohol but as medicine, provided a vaidya prescribes it for me.
('73', 65, 1, 12, 140569) If this movement of ours is conducive to non violence, let us at least demonstrate unity amongst all Hindus.
('73', 65, 1, 13, 140678) Why did I stretch this point?
('73', 65, 1, 14, 140708) Because the other point that I wish to make follows from this.
('73', 65, 1, 15, 140771) You must never forget one more fact regarding Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 65, 1, 16, 140837) It is a test for every religion.
('73', 65, 1, 17, 140870) Even if there be nothing special about Hinduism it must have something distinct about it.
('73', 65, 1, 18, 140960) Otherwise how could it come to have the name Hindu?
('73', 65, 1, 19, 141012) [Now] does this distinctiveness consist in playing Holi?
('73', 65, 1, 20, 141069) Does the distinctiveness of Islam consist in hit and run tactics?
('73', 65, 1, 21, 141135) Does Hindu ism teach animality?
('73', 65, 1, 22, 141167) And did the Prophets religion teach lawlessness?
('73', 65, 1, 23, 141216) My point is that you should first become a true Hindu and then go to the Muslims.
('73', 65, 1, 24, 141298) Till then no unity is possible.
('73', 65, 1, 25, 141330) I know there are many Muslims who believe that so long as Hindus do not recite the kalmah they will not be saved.
('73', 65, 1, 26, 141444) But if we prove through purity in our life and perfection of conduct that one can be saved even without reciting the kalmah, the Muslims too will be impelled to have respect for the Hindus.
('73', 65, 1, 27, 141634) Such true unity will not be achieved through any political agreement.
('73', 65, 1, 28, 141704) Such business pacts are futile.
('73', 65, 1, 29, 141736) What is needed is an understanding based on dharma, where there is no question of a bar gain.
('73', 65, 1, 30, 141830) For this, friendship between brave people and the non violence of the strong are required.
('73', 65, 1, 31, 141921) Even if a frightening smashan 2 inter posessuch non violence will fearlessly make its way through it.
('73', 65, 1, 32, 142023) I do not claim that I have attained such non violence.
('73', 65, 1, 33, 142078) I am afraid of every [little] thing.
('73', 65, 1, 34, 142115) Perhaps I am the weakest and the most cowardly of all.
('73', 65, 1, 35, 142170) But I am all the same a devotee of true non violence.
('73', 65, 1, 36, 142224) I tell you that so long as we do not attain the non violence of the strong and our conduct is not truly religious, the Muslims will have no respect for our

('73', 66, 1, 2, 142566) religion and love for us.
('73', 66, 2, 3, 142592) GANGADHARRAO: If the resolution is withdrawn the consequence will not be good.
('73', 66, 3, 4, 142671) BAPU: I dont agree.
('73', 66, 4, 5, 142691) JAMNALAL: I had a special reason when I said that we should have Muslim
('73', 66, 5, 6, 142763) members.
('73', 66, 5, 7, 142772) Only a Muslim can persuade another Muslim if the latter misbehaves, and
('73', 66, 6, 8, 142844) the same applies to Hindus.
('73', 66, 6, 9, 142872) But I find that even the most respectable Muslim seldom
('73', 66, 7, 10, 142928) raises his voice against the misdeeds of his community.
('73', 66, 7, 11, 142984) On the other hand one can
('73', 66, 8, 12, 143010) keep them in good humour only by justifying their every action, good or bad.
('73', 66, 9, 13, 143087) cannot tolerate this state of affairs.
('73', 66, 9, 14, 143126) I cannot uphold what Prabhudas did.
('73', 66, 9, 15, 143162) Must we stop
('73', 66, 10, 16, 143175) our music for fear of losing the Muslims friendship?
('73', 66, 10, 17, 143228) Friendship does not imply that
('73', 66, 11, 18, 143259) we give up resistance to injustice.
('73', 66, 11, 19, 143295) But this, more or less, has till now been the policy
('73', 66, 12, 20, 143348) of the Congress as well as the Gandhi Seva Sangh.
('73', 66, 12, 21, 143398) In my opinion appeasement
('73', 66, 13, 22, 143424) cannot bring about unity or love.
('73', 66, 14, 23, 143458) BAPU: If we have formed the notion that we should suffer the atrocities of the Muslims in mute submissiveness it is absolutely wrong.
('73', 66, 14, 24, 143592) If until today I have not said that we must also resist injustice inflicted by them, here I say it now.
('73', 66, 14, 25, 143696) We should now tell the Muslims also that they have been unjust and, if they beat us up for saying it, we should get beaten up.
('73', 66, 14, 26, 143823) As for the resolution, we should have it after making some efforts and gaining experience in the matter.
('73', 66, 14, 27, 143928) It is likely that experimenting on these lines someone may get some new inspi ration.
('73', 66, 14, 28, 144014) In that case we can call a special session of the Sangh before the end of the year.
('73', 66, 15, 29, 144098) DASTANE: If not this resolution, let us have another commensurate with our faith and strength.
('73', 66, 16, 30, 144193) BAPU: Yes, we can do it if you like.
('73', 66, 16, 31, 144230) But in my opinion, it would be proper to do so only after making an experiment and gaining experience.

('73', 67, 7, 13, 144871) Gandhiji proposed that efforts should be made to give eight annas as minimum wages to spinners working for eight hours a day, thus allowing at least fifteen rupees per month.
('73', 67, 7, 14, 145046) Mahatmaji also said that the price of khadi should be so fixed as to bring more money from the rich and less from the poor.
('73', 67, 7, 15, 145170) Gandhiji asked members seriously to ponder over his proposals.

('73', 67, 9, 18, 145305) DELANG, March 30, 1938 This is the last day of the present session.
('73', 67, 9, 19, 145373) I myself was not aware that I was going to speak today.
('73', 67, 9, 20, 145429) Kishorelal told me that I was expected to speak.
('73', 67, 9, 21, 145478) Later I also felt like it.
('73', 67, 9, 22, 145505) Before I say what I wish to, I shall answer a question.
('73', 67, 9, 23, 145561) It has been asked whether every member of the Working Committee is not expected to put in 1500 hours of work in the Gandhi Seva Sangh every year.
('73', 67, 9, 24, 145707) The question has been posed by Jethalal.
('73', 67, 9, 25, 145748) Although the idea is very good it cannot be put into practice.
('73', 67, 9, 26, 145811) Today, we must give up our insistence on this.
('73', 67, 9, 27, 145858) Everyone should put in as much physical labournot mental or intellectualas possible.
('73', 67, 10, 28, 145943) 1 Vide letter to the addressee, Letter to Mirabehn, 28 3 1938
('73', 68, 0, 1, 146005) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 69
('73', 68, 1, 2, 146054) However, we cannot go so far as to expect daily four or five hours work from the members.
('73', 68, 1, 3, 146144) This is not an association of labourers.
('73', 68, 1, 4, 146185) If it can become one, well and good.
('73', 68, 1, 5, 146222) But today it is an association of educated people.
('73', 68, 1, 6, 146273) If we wish to take five hours work daily from the Working Committee, we should ourselves do it first.
('73', 68, 1, 7, 146375) How can those people find the time for all this at present?
('73', 68, 1, 8, 146435) In this country the trouble is that those who are supposed to be big men get very little time.
('73', 68, 1, 9, 146530) Where can Vallabhbhai find so much time?
('73', 68, 1, 10, 146571) In that case we should ask him to quit.
('73', 68, 1, 11, 146611) But then we cannot do without him.
('73', 68, 1, 12, 146646) We ought to realize our limitations.
('73', 68, 1, 13, 146683) Yesterday I had decided to remain silent on what I am now going to say.
('73', 68, 1, 14, 146755) But I changed my mind this morning.
('73', 68, 1, 15, 146791) I am glad that Mahadev has told you something about what has happened, and now that he has said something I feel like speaking out all that is in me.
('73', 68, 1, 16, 146941) The various items of constructive activity that you are doing are only outward expressions of truth and ahimsa.
('73', 68, 1, 17, 147053) They only reveal how far they can carry you on the road of ahimsa and truth, and ultimately to freedom.
('73', 68, 1, 18, 147157) The removal of untouchability is one of the highest expre ssions of ahimsa.
('73', 68, 1, 19, 147233) It is my daily prayer, as it should be the prayer of you all, that if untouchability does not perish it were far better that Hinduism perished.
('73', 68, 1, 20, 147377) This prayer found its most poignant expre ssion during my Harijan tour of which the principal objective was the opening of the temples to Harijans.
('73', 68, 1, 21, 147525) They tell me that the untouchables do not wish to enter the temples.
('73', 68, 1, 22, 147594) Even if this is true, the reason behind this is that we have made such monsters of them that they no longer have any need for temples.
('73', 68, 1, 23, 147729) Even if they do not care to go into the temples it should be our concern to permit their entry.
('73', 68, 1, 24, 147825) And I have declared day in and day out that whoever believed in the removal of untouchability should shun temples which were not open to Harijans.
('73', 68, 1, 25, 147972) Now, how could I bear the thought of my wife or my daughters having gone to such temples?
('73', 68, 1, 26, 148062) I would plead with them, would go on bended knees to dissuade them from going to these temples, and might have to deny myself personal ties with them if my entreaties failed.
('73', 68, 1, 27, 148237) I have tried to live up to this principle all these years, and I felt humbled and humiliated when I knew that my wife and two ashram inmates 1 whom I regard as my daughters had gone into the Puri temple.
('73', 68, 1, 28, 148441) The agony was enough to precipitate a collapse.
('73', 68, 1, 29, 148489) The machine recorded an alarmingly high blood pressure, but I knew better than

('73', 69, 1, 2, 148672) the machine.
('73', 69, 1, 3, 148685) I was in a worse condition than the machine could show.
('73', 69, 1, 4, 148741) The Gita teaches us the lesson of detachment, but that detachment does not mean indifference to shocks of this kindfailure in duty on the part of ones dearest ones.
('73', 69, 1, 5, 148906) The three who went were the least to blame.
('73', 69, 1, 6, 148950) They went in ignorance.
('73', 69, 1, 7, 148974) But I was to blame, and Mahadev was more to blame in that he did not tell them what their dharma was and how any breach would shake me.
('73', 69, 1, 8, 149110) He ought to have thought also of its social repercussions.
('73', 69, 1, 9, 149169) We should understand our individual as well as our social dharma.
('73', 69, 1, 10, 149235) How did it affect me?
('73', 69, 1, 11, 149257) I turned pale.
('73', 69, 1, 12, 149272) My grandson says that the Amrita Bazar Patrika reports that Kasutrbai did not go in but waited outside.
('73', 69, 1, 13, 149376) If that was so I would have leapt high.
('73', 69, 1, 14, 149416) But how could she at all go there after having lived with me for fifty years?
('73', 69, 1, 15, 149494) And why did the two other women go?
('73', 69, 1, 16, 149530) Are they not my daughters?
('73', 69, 1, 17, 149557) That too is my fault.
('73', 69, 1, 18, 149579) This act of theirs has depleted our soul force.
('73', 69, 1, 19, 149627) We ought to be more vigilant.
('73', 69, 1, 20, 149657) By looking upon women as [mere] women we overlook such matters.
('73', 69, 1, 21, 149721) That is not the way of non violence.
('73', 69, 1, 22, 149758) This is a matter of awakening.
('73', 69, 1, 23, 149789) It was Mahadevs task to have reasoned with them.
('73', 69, 1, 24, 149838) And, if they were not convinced, he should have brought them to me.
('73', 69, 1, 25, 149906) I would have told them that I was their spiritual father and not opposed to their religion.
('73', 69, 1, 26, 149998) I could be their spiritual father only if they and I belonged to one faith.
('73', 69, 1, 27, 150074) If their faith could be identified with mine I could reason also with the people: What is the use of [going to] such temples? They were ignorant, I know, but we are respon sible for their ignorance, and it is the reverse of ahimsa not to dispel their ignorance.
('73', 69, 1, 28, 150336) I sent them to Puri not to go into the temple, but to stand just where the Harijans were allowed to go and refuse in protest to go beyond that limit.
('73', 69, 1, 29, 150486) That would have been the right kind of propaganda, and they would that way have done Harijan service.
('73', 69, 1, 30, 150588) To do scavenging work or to eat with Harijans or to feed them is not enough, if we do not deny ourselves the going to temples and the like so long as our kith and kin, the Harijans, are denied their use.
('73', 69, 1, 31, 150792) If we do not go even to the temples which have been regarded as sacred for hundreds and thousands of years, where such great men as Chaitanya 1 have gone in to offer worship, where we long to go, simply because our Harijan brothers are not allowed, it would be a great act of dharma and, if God really is in the temples, as we believe, it will

('73', 70, 1, 2, 151289) certainly have its effect.
('73', 70, 1, 3, 151316) The pandas 1 had come there and said that the Harijans could go along with us.
('73', 70, 1, 4, 151395) Quite correct.
('73', 70, 1, 5, 151410) For a panda the silver coin is God.
('73', 70, 1, 6, 151446) I therefore prevented Rajendra Babus sister from going in.
('73', 70, 1, 7, 151505) Some may say that I exercised undue pressure.
('73', 70, 1, 8, 151551) I would say I saved her from adharma.
('73', 70, 1, 9, 151589) If I intruded it was in the name of religion.
('73', 70, 1, 10, 151635) Like these three women many others must have gone and must be inten ding to go.
('73', 70, 1, 11, 151715) I have expressed my feelings for the sake of these people.
('73', 70, 1, 12, 151774) What can I say to those who cannot restrain themselves even after this?
('73', 70, 1, 13, 151846) There is another aspect of the case.
('73', 70, 1, 14, 151883) The sanatanists believe that untouchability is part of Hinduism, and so do the Mussalmans and the Christians who think that Hinduism is nothing if not dont touchism.
('73', 70, 1, 15, 152049) But the virus of untouchability has infected them too.
('73', 70, 1, 16, 152104) They shun the Bhangis.
('73', 70, 1, 17, 152127) You cannot finally solve the Hindu Muslim problem until you have removed the stain of untouchability by non violent means.
('73', 70, 1, 18, 152250) The Muslims will then cease to regard us as unbelievers.
('73', 70, 1, 19, 152307) They will then say that we might be idolators but God is in the idols too.
('73', 70, 1, 20, 152382) Hence, I have asked the idol worshippers to befriend the Muslims.
('73', 70, 1, 21, 152448) That is the path of courageous non violence.
('73', 70, 1, 22, 152493) Perhaps Mau lana Saheb also believes that Gandhi is what he says he is, but the other Hindus are steeped in untouchability.
('73', 70, 1, 23, 152617) It is our responsibility to change his opinion of us.
('73', 70, 1, 24, 152671) Then there are the Harijans themselves.
('73', 70, 1, 25, 152711) How are we to carry to them the conviction that we are with them through thick and thin, that we are completely identifying ourselves with them, unless we can carry our familiesour wives, our children, brothers, sisters, relativeswith us in our programme of the removal of untouchability?
('73', 70, 1, 26, 153000) Is it possible that a member of the Gandhi Seva Sangh might claim that his dharma is different from his wifes and sisters?
('73', 70, 1, 27, 153123) This is neither religious tolerance nor is it non violence.
('73', 70, 1, 28, 153183) People will think we are hypocrites.
('73', 70, 1, 29, 153220) Intense faith is what is called dharma.
('73', 70, 1, 30, 153260) The essence of dharma is non violence; it is another name for it.
('73', 70, 1, 31, 153326) Its power is such that the sword would drop from the Englishmans hand.
('73', 70, 1, 32, 153397) The Muslims lawlessness would be held back.
('73', 70, 1, 33, 153441) Patanjali has said that violence becomes ineffective when confronted by non violence.
('73', 70, 1, 34, 153527) If this has not happened till this day it is because our non violence has been that of the weak and timid.

('73', 71, 3, 6, 153975) My health will not permit me to do much work in Calcutta.
('73', 71, 3, 7, 154033) Even if Birlaji consults me I shall not give him much time; 2 it all depends on my health.
('73', 71, 3, 8, 154124) Do only what Shankerlal asks you to do.
('73', 71, 3, 9, 154164) I shall regain my health, if at all, only on my return to Segaon

('73', 71, 6, 12, 154297) DELANG, [On or before March 31, 1938] 3
('73', 71, 7, 13, 154337) Gandhiji was asked in Delang what the Ministers attitude should be over the appointment of Acting Governors in the Provinces.
('73', 71, 7, 14, 154463) He said that acting appointments should not be made from among the services in the Provinces.
('73', 71, 7, 15, 154557) Ministers will not relish the idea of a subordinate official suddenly becoming Governor to whom they have often to refer for guidance and who may even preside over their deliberations.
('73', 71, 7, 16, 154742) Such a Governor cannot act with detachment nor can he command the res pect and confidence of the Ministers.
('73', 71, 7, 17, 154850) I should think that the Viceroy or the Secretary of State would think twice before making such appointments.
('73', 71, 7, 18, 154959) Ministers would be right, indeed it might be their duty, to protest against such an appointment.
('73', 71, 7, 19, 155056) I do not know that such an appointment might not be, casus belli.
('73', 71, 7, 20, 155122) In the Colonies generally I have known the practice of Chief Justices of Supreme Courts acting as Governors in the absence of permanent ones.
('73', 71, 8, 21, 155264) Harijan, 2 4 1938
('73', 71, 9, 22, 155282) 1 From the addressees letter to Gandhiji, as also from the contents of this letter, it appears that this was written from Delang which Gandhiji left on March 31, 1938. 2 The addressee wanted to discuss with Gandhiji the Birla Mills labour problem.
('73', 71, 9, 23, 155530) 3 Gandhiji was in Delang till March 31.

('73', 72, 1, 2, 155619) 56. LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI March 31, 1938
('73', 72, 2, 3, 155662) MAHADEV, What a gift so early in the morning!
('73', 72, 2, 4, 155708) But if even one mistake is not corrected immediately, it will lead to a succession of others.
('73', 72, 2, 5, 155802) All the same I will tolerate thousands of mistakes, but I can never part with you.
('73', 72, 2, 6, 155885) Even death at the hands of a bhakta is preferable to salvation at the hands of those who have no love for one.
('73', 72, 2, 7, 155996) There is, therefore, no question of your leaving.
('73', 72, 2, 8, 156046) Now I will list your mistakes.
('73', 72, 2, 9, 156077) I dont blame Durga or Velanbehn at all.
('73', 72, 2, 10, 156117) Ba has already made atonement; not by fasting but by confessing her lapse to me with utter simplicity.
('73', 72, 2, 11, 156220) She thus made holier yesterday our holy relationship of over fifty five years.
('73', 72, 2, 12, 156299) But what did you do?
('73', 72, 2, 13, 156320) Either your negligence or your blind love for Durga let her do a wrong thing.
('73', 72, 2, 14, 156398) And afterwards when you came to know of my pain, you started a fast without thinking.
('73', 72, 2, 15, 156484) Fasting is no remedy for thoughtlessness or wrong thinking.
('73', 72, 2, 16, 156544) The remedy lies in right thinking.
('73', 72, 2, 17, 156579) When I came to know about your fast, I tried to dis suade you, but to no avail.
('73', 72, 2, 18, 156659) I advised you to think carefully instead of fasting.
('73', 72, 2, 19, 156712) You did not do that.
('73', 72, 2, 20, 156733) You did not even try to understand my point of view.
('73', 72, 2, 21, 156786) Yesterday I asked you very tenderly whether you had understood what I said.
('73', 72, 2, 22, 156862) The reply you gave then was not proper.
('73', 72, 2, 23, 156902) Your behaviour was still worse.
('73', 72, 2, 24, 156934) Instead of attending Maulanas speech, which it was your duty to do, you went away to cry.
('73', 72, 2, 25, 157024) And as a result you threw a silly poem at me.
('73', 72, 2, 26, 157070) Last night also you should have.
('73', 72, 2, 27, 157103) given some time to Maulana, which you did not do.
('73', 72, 2, 28, 157153) You did not, thus, fully avail yourself of the opportunity of serving a Mussalman.
('73', 72, 2, 29, 157236) Had my words yesterday had their intended effect, you would have gone today to Puri with a band of workers and would have shaken up Puri.
('73', 72, 2, 30, 157374) But perhaps I myself was not sufficiently serious, otherwise I should have thought of this right in the beginning.
('73', 72, 2, 31, 157489) If your duty is as clear to you as daylight, I would even grant a days leave and also let you take along with you anybody who might be ready to go.
('73', 72, 2, 32, 157637) This may be done even today if it is possible.
('73', 72, 2, 33, 157684) You say that you interpret me, but may I ask to whom?
('73', 72, 2, 34, 157738) Is it not to Velanbehn?
('73', 73, 0, 1, 157762) 74 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 73, 1, 2, 157803) Your poetic imagination sometimes blinds you to reality.
('73', 73, 1, 3, 157860) There is nothing but cowardice in your letter.
('73', 73, 1, 4, 157907) If you decide to leave me, will Pyarelal stay on?
('73', 73, 1, 5, 157957) And if Pyarelal leaves, will Sushila stay?
('73', 73, 1, 6, 158000) Of what use to me is her extraordinary intelligence?
('73', 73, 1, 7, 158053) She has such intelligence that it sometimes pains me to think that it will rust if she stays with me.
('73', 73, 1, 8, 158155) Why does it not occur to you that I could let all of them go if I let you go?
('73', 73, 1, 9, 158233) They will all run away.
('73', 73, 1, 10, 158257) Lilavati will simply go mad.
('73', 73, 1, 11, 158286) I will suffer even that, if such be my lot.
('73', 73, 1, 12, 158330) But I will never send away you or any body else.
('73', 73, 1, 13, 158379) And yet how can I prevent anybody from running away?
('73', 73, 1, 14, 158432) Let this incident inspire poetry in your heart.
('73', 73, 1, 15, 158480) Correct your error if you see hat you have made one.
('73', 73, 1, 16, 158533) If you cannot see it, ask me to explain it to you.
('73', 73, 1, 17, 158584) If you think that I have committed any error, correct me.
('73', 73, 1, 18, 158642) This is no time for crying or fasting.
('73', 73, 1, 19, 158681) You should read less, but think more.
('73', 73, 1, 20, 158719) Study carefully all that has been done here.
('73', 73, 1, 21, 158764) You yourself should utilize Sushilas and Pyarelals talents and thus lighten the burden on you.
('73', 73, 1, 22, 158859) Take work from Lilavati too.
('73', 73, 1, 23, 158888) This incident shows me that being crushed under the weight of external activities, you think less.
('73', 73, 1, 24, 158987) Thereby you will be able to do much less by way of interpreting me.
('73', 73, 1, 25, 159055) How much more shall I go on writing?

('73', 73, 7, 34, 159352) I have already written to Ba and made my suggestion regarding Kanam.
('73', 73, 7, 35, 159421) If she permits you to take charge of him, do so.
('73', 73, 7, 36, 159470) If you do, you should give up the kitchen work.
('73', 73, 7, 37, 159518) You may give some help if necessary.

('73', 73, 7, 39, 159579) Talk less.

('73', 74, 4, 8, 160058) Would you not regard Sushilas letter as coming from me?
('73', 74, 4, 9, 160114) You yourself wrote that I should not write [myself], that a letter from Sushila or anyone else would suffice.
('73', 74, 4, 10, 160224) If you steadied your mind you must soon get well.
('73', 74, 4, 11, 160274) I am all right.

('73', 74, 8, 20, 160629) You will be posted nowhere but in Segaon.
('73', 74, 8, 21, 160671) I see no inconvenience in your visiting your home once a year.
('73', 74, 8, 22, 160734) I might send you to Wardha if any work comes up there.
('73', 74, 8, 23, 160789) If you find these conditions acceptable, you may come over on the 15th April or even earlier depending on my reaching there.

('73', 75, 10, 16, 161799) Gandhiji who is observing silence owing to ill health wrote the following on
('73', 75, 11, 17, 161876) a slip of paper: I am glad you have come.
('73', 75, 11, 18, 161918) I wish I were speaking and well enough for a fairly long discussion.
('73', 75, 11, 19, 161987) You are quite right in saying that I do not wish the extinction of old zamindaris.
('73', 75, 11, 20, 162070) All Congressmen do not think so.
('73', 75, 11, 21, 162103) The remedy lies in the hands of zamindar friends.
('73', 75, 11, 22, 162153) How it is so, I have shown through the articles I have written.
('73', 75, 11, 23, 162217) Nevertheless, if you so desire, I will gladly set apart some time to meet your friends.
('73', 75, 11, 24, 162305) That cannot be in Calcutta.
('73', 75, 11, 25, 162333) I am hardly in a fit state to cope with the work I have there.

('73', 77, 7, 11, 163661) I hope it is well with you.
('73', 77, 7, 12, 163689) I do not like these frequent attacks.
('73', 77, 7, 13, 163727) I know that earth and water are the two cures.
('73', 77, 7, 14, 163774) Of course light and air are there; you have a fair dose of them.
('73', 77, 7, 15, 163839) But not of the other two.
('73', 77, 7, 16, 163865) You must take the hip, friction and sitz baths and have abdominal and local earth band ages.
('73', 77, 7, 17, 163958) There is no set back in my health.

('73', 77, 7, 19, 164060) 2 I must not give you the whole history.
('73', 77, 7, 20, 164101) I have not yet got over the shock.
('73', 77, 7, 21, 164136) The pressure therefore has just now steadied round 175 80 and 108 104. The mental fatigue I had lost has returned.
('73', 77, 7, 22, 164251) I have lost perhaps 5 1b.
('73', 77, 7, 23, 164277) in weight.
('73', 77, 7, 24, 164288) As soon as I am free from the Calcutta business I shall make up for the losses.

('73', 77, 7, 26, 164447) This is being written during silence.

('73', 78, 7, 9, 165208) BRIJKRISHNA, I do not understand why you abandoned your work among the stone breakers and the tongawalas.
('73', 78, 7, 10, 165314) I stopped you from coming to Segaon for a short visit but it is different if you want to come for good for the sake of service.
('73', 78, 7, 11, 165442) I am a little afraid that you will get tired quite soon; what will you do in Segaon?
('73', 78, 7, 12, 165527) Take it that coming over merely to serve me is nothing but false attachment.
('73', 78, 7, 13, 165604) I am weary of the overwhelming service I receive.

('73', 78, 11, 19, 165848) April 3, 1938 My attention has been drawn to the press report purporting to give the gist of the conversations that took place between Sir Nazi muddin 2 and me on April 2. The conversations were strictly confi dential and, therefore, the report can only come from a fertile journalistic brain.
('73', 78, 11, 20, 166142) Ever since I have entered upon this self imposed mission on behalf of political prisoners and detenus, I have made

('73', 79, 1, 2, 166406) known the terms upon which I have intervened.
('73', 79, 1, 3, 166452) But the giving of assurances by prisoners or detenus as a price of freedom has never crossed my mind.
('73', 79, 1, 4, 166554) As a civil resister, I would not be guilty of inducing any political prisoner to give such assurances.
('73', 79, 1, 5, 166657) And I can also add that during my talks with the prisoners at Alipore and Howrah jails and the Regulation III prisoners at Hijli, they made it absolutely clear to me that they would give no assurance to anyone for the purpose of purchasing their freedom.
('73', 79, 1, 6, 166912) I wish for the sake of the cause that the news papers will not anticipate events.
('73', 79, 1, 7, 166994) Every unauthentic report adds to my difficulties which are already formidable.

('73', 85, 6, 12, 176271) My remarks arising out of the recent riots in U.P. 1 have attracted much attention.
('73', 85, 6, 13, 176355) Friends have sent me cuttings from the Press.
('73', 85, 6, 14, 176401) This is some of the criticism printed or spoken : (1) My writing betrayed hysteria.
('73', 85, 6, 15, 176485) (2) I wrote without sufficient data.
('73', 85, 6, 16, 176522) (3) I had recanted my views on non co operation and civil resistance.
('73', 85, 6, 17, 176592) (4) I had been driven to the policy of the Liberals.
('73', 85, 6, 18, 176645) (5) Congressmen had never adopted non violence as between themselves.
('73', 85, 6, 19, 176715) (6) I was expecting the impossible from human nature.
('73', 85, 6, 20, 176769) (7) If my position was accepted swaraj would never be obtained, for all India could never become non violent.
('73', 85, 6, 21, 176879) There is much more I could cull from the criticism.
('73', 85, 6, 22, 176931) I have only taken the relevant parts.
('73', 85, 6, 23, 176969) 1. If my article betrayed hysteria, the symptoms still persist, for in spite of the criticism which I have studied with the care it demanded, I see nothing to change the position I have taken up.

('73', 86, 0, 1, 177195) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 87
('73', 86, 1, 2, 177244) critics should remember that my proposition was specific and narrow.
('73', 86, 1, 3, 177313) Swaraj could not be obtained through non violent means unless our non violence was of the brave and such as to be able to deal effec tively with violence.
('73', 86, 1, 4, 177468) I have not maintained that it could not be obtained by other means.
('73', 86, 1, 5, 177536) But if it could be so obtained we were not ready to deliver the goods, for we were not ready for matching our force against the British.
('73', 86, 1, 6, 177673) 2. All the data required were that there were riots, no matter on how small a scale, that Congressmen were not able to deal with them non violently, and that the aid of the police and the military had to be summoned.
('73', 86, 1, 7, 177890) There was no dispute about these three broad facts.
('73', 86, 1, 8, 177942) They were enough to enable me to draw the conclusion I did.
('73', 86, 1, 9, 178002) In this there was no reflection on the Ministers.
('73', 86, 1, 10, 178052) I have admitted that they could not have acted otherwise.
('73', 86, 1, 11, 178110) The fact, however, remains that the Congress non violence was not able to cope with the emergency.
('73', 86, 1, 12, 178209) 3. There is nothing in my article to warrant the infe rence that I had lost my faith in non co operation and civil resistance.
('73', 86, 1, 13, 178336) All I need say is that it is brighter than ever.
('73', 86, 1, 14, 178385) The two are quite enough to bring swaraj, provided that non violence practised is of the bravest.
('73', 86, 1, 15, 178483) 4. I wish I could be drawn towards the policy of the Liberals.
('73', 86, 1, 16, 178546) I have many personal friends among them.
('73', 86, 1, 17, 178587) But they have no sanction.
('73', 86, 1, 18, 178614) I claim that I have an infallible sanction.
('73', 86, 1, 19, 178658) My article was written to show that during the riots it was not the sanction that had failed, the failure was of the organization which had accepted the sanction, namely, active, constructive non violence.
('73', 86, 1, 20, 178864) 5. I can only refer the critics to the many resolutions of the Congress which do not confine the use of non violence only towards Englishmen.
('73', 86, 1, 21, 179006) Indeed I remember having many discusions at the Working Committee meetings at which the necessity of non vio lence among ourselves was emphasized.
('73', 86, 1, 22, 179153) 6. Well, human nature has hitherto responded nobly to the call of non violence.
('73', 86, 1, 23, 179233) But I am concerned with the Congress nature.
('73', 86, 1, 24, 179278) Congressmen have to sign a pledge which commits them to non violence.
('73', 86, 1, 25, 179348) 1 My question was and ishave they non violence in them?
('73', 86, 1, 26, 179404) If they have, is it of the brave?
('73', 86, 1, 27, 179438) My thesis is that if it is of the brave, it should be enough for dealing with the riots and for delivering the goods.
('73', 86, 2, 28, 179556) 1 The practice was started in 1919 at the time of the satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act; vide Instructions to Volunteers, 26 2 1919

('73', 87, 1, 2, 179730) 7. This is answered in the foregoing.
('73', 87, 1, 3, 179768) But I have the fear that our non violence is not of the kind required.
('73', 87, 1, 4, 179839) Congressmen may not treat my warning lightly.
('73', 87, 1, 5, 179885) After all I am supposed to be the Congress expert, however inefficient, on non violence.
('73', 87, 1, 6, 179974) I have confidence in my readings and my remedies.
('73', 87, 1, 7, 180024) I cite Ahmedabad and Viramgam violences 1, Bombay violence during the Princes visit, 2 and Chauri Chaura 3 on the eve of Bardoli.
('73', 87, 1, 8, 180154) The results have amply justified the remedies applied at my instance, though on these occassions critics were not wanting who had expressed their strong disapproval of the suspensions.
('73', 87, 1, 9, 180339) I have no doubt about my present diagnosis [or] about the remedies.
('73', 87, 1, 10, 180407) The remedies are not beyond our ability if we have a living conviction about non violence and its nature.
('73', 87, 1, 11, 180513) Here are some of the remedies : 1. We must discover a solution for the Hindu Muslim tension.
('73', 87, 1, 12, 180606) I use that expression deliberately instead of communalfor if we find this, the other will follow as a matter of course.
('73', 87, 1, 13, 180726) 2. There must be a purging of the Congress registers so as to make them proof against bogus voters.
('73', 87, 1, 14, 180826) From all accounts I receive, our registers contain too many bogus names to be called at all accurate.
('73', 87, 1, 15, 180928) 3. Congressmen must not be afraid to find themselves in a minority.
('73', 87, 1, 16, 180996) 4. Without delay every Provincial Congress Committee should raise a proper corps of volunteers pledged to non violence in thought, word and deed.
('73', 87, 1, 17, 181142) And there should be a manual of instructions as to training, etc., prepared for universal use.
('73', 87, 1, 18, 181237) There is nothing heroic or impracticable in these suggestions.
('73', 87, 1, 19, 181300) But they are impracticable if those who lead have no living faith in non violence.
('73', 87, 1, 20, 181383) If they have not, the sooner non violence is removed from the Congress vocabulary the better it is for the Congress and the nation.
('73', 87, 1, 21, 181515) The alternative is certainly not unadulterated violence.
('73', 87, 1, 22, 181572) The Congress is the only political organization in the world which has, at my instance, adopted unadulterated non violence for the attainment of swaraj.
('73', 87, 1, 23, 181725) It is its only sanction.
('73', 87, 1, 24, 181750) I dare say that if its quality is not what it

('73', 88, 1, 3, 182126) In the last heat we may be found to be cowards instead of brave men and women.
('73', 88, 1, 4, 182205) And there is no disgrace greater than cowardice for fighters for freedom.
('73', 88, 1, 5, 182279) Surely there is nothing to be ashamed of in retracing our steps.
('73', 88, 1, 6, 182344) If we feel that we shall not be able to displace the British power without a violent struggle, the Congress must say so to the nation and prepare accordingly.
('73', 88, 1, 7, 182503) We must do what is being done all the world over forbear when we can, hit when we must.
('73', 88, 1, 8, 182591) If that is to be our creed or policy, we have lost precious seventeen years.
('73', 88, 1, 9, 182668) But it is never too late to learn and mend.
('73', 88, 1, 10, 182712) Seventeen years in the life of a nation is nothing.
('73', 88, 1, 11, 182764) It will go hard with Congressmen if having received the warning they do not make the choice.

('73', 89, 2, 3, 183554) April 10, 1938
('73', 89, 3, 4, 183569) Gandhiji said that he would like to spend at least a day in the Ashram, but he was unable to do so this time owing to his preoccupations in Calcutta.
('73', 89, 3, 5, 183719) He found it difficult to express in words his love for the Ashram and the Ashramites, and urged them to carry on their mission of spreading the use of khadi amongst the masses.
('73', 89, 4, 6, 183896) Through Sodepur, he added, they were serving the entire Hindustan.
('73', 89, 4, 7, 183963) Mahatma Gandhi hoped that their services would be more and more appreciated all over the country.

('73', 89, 8, 12, 184360) He further added that the Congress would try its level best to stamp out the sin of untouchability from the soil of Bengal.
('73', 89, 8, 13, 184484) He asked Mr. Thakur to visit the different Congress Provinces and study for himself the Congress work and activities for the uplift of the Scheduled Castes and make a propaganda in Bengal so that the Bengal Scheduled Castes might respond to the clarion call of the Congress for achieving Indias political end.

('73', 93, 2, 5, 189667) How is your home life?
('73', 93, 2, 6, 189690) Have you set up house on your own?
('73', 93, 2, 7, 189725) The amount of service which you two together render should be not twice but four times as much.
('73', 93, 2, 8, 189821) There should be multiplication and not addition in such matters.
('73', 93, 2, 9, 189886) I had Puratans 2 and Lalitjis letters.
('73', 93, 2, 10, 189925) I am not writing to them separately.
('73', 93, 2, 11, 189962) Wont this letter suffice ?
('73', 93, 2, 12, 189989) Both of you should daily read Chapter XII 3 [of the Gita] and ponder over it.

('73', 93, 4, 15, 190161) CALCUTTA, April 13, 1938 I regret to inform the public that the negotiations that I have been conducting with the Government of Bengal through Sir Nazim uddin have not yet been concluded.
('73', 93, 4, 16, 190349) I must confess that my arrival in Calcutta was ill timed, as the Ministers were all busy with the assembly work and as it was known that I should come back before the end of March, I felt it was unnecessary to ascertain Sir Nazimuddins wishes about the time of my arrival.
('73', 93, 4, 17, 190622) Had I taken the precaution of writing to him, I would not have found myself in Calcutta at an inauspicious moment.
('73', 93, 4, 18, 190737) I have now to write a letter 5 to Sir Nazimuddin, summarizing my suggestions which, I am assured, will be considered by the Government as speedily as possible and definite decisions takena process which, it is expected, will be completed within one month.

('73', 94, 1, 2, 191267) hoped, however, that the decisions may be taken much earlier, and if it becomes necessary for me to return to Calcutta, I shall do so without hesitation, provided, of course, that my health permits it.
('73', 94, 1, 3, 191469) Meanwhile I must repeat that all agitation for the release of detenus and prisoners should be suspended while negotiations con tinue.
('73', 94, 1, 4, 191603) I must also state that it is not conducive to the success of the negotiations if public demonstrations are held in honour of those who may be discharged.
('73', 94, 1, 5, 191757) In my opinion, it is more dignified for Congress men to exercise restraint.
('73', 94, 1, 6, 191833) I have seen extracts of speeches and addresses as reported in the papers which do not betray any spirit of non violence.
('73', 94, 1, 7, 191954) I may add that whilst I have been seeing the convicted prisoners and discussing with them their attitude to non violence for my own guidance, the Government have made it plain to me that whatever the prisoners might state to me will not be allowed to determine their policy.
('73', 94, 1, 8, 192229) They think that it will be improper for them to base their action on such assurances as I may issue.
('73', 94, 1, 9, 192330) I fully appreciate the Government view.
('73', 94, 1, 10, 192370) My talks with political prisoners therefore are purely for my own personal satisfaction.
('73', 94, 2, 11, 192459) In so far as the 14 Regulation prisoners are concerned, they gave me at
('73', 94, 3, 12, 192531) the interview I had with them the following letter :
('73', 94, 4, 13, 192584) During your last visit you expressed your desire to be acquainted with
('73', 94, 5, 14, 192655) our definite views on certain things.
('73', 94, 5, 15, 192693) After giving full consideration to the
('73', 94, 6, 16, 192732) matter we can only reaffirm what we said then.
('73', 94, 6, 17, 192779) As long as we are in detention
('73', 94, 7, 18, 192810) we are unable to discuss our past and future and our political opinion.
('73', 94, 8, 19, 192882) Particularly when the talk of release is in the air it affects our sense of self 
('73', 94, 9, 20, 192964) respect to say anything that may have some bearing on the question of our
('73', 94, 10, 21, 193038) own release.
('73', 94, 10, 22, 193051) We hope you will appreciate our standpoint and readily concede
('73', 94, 11, 23, 193114) that we mean no personal disrespect.
('73', 94, 11, 24, 193151) It was signed by nine.
('73', 94, 11, 25, 193174) Four other prisoners had not signed the letter but they associated themselves with the sentiments expressed therein, and the fifth gave a letter very similar to the foregoing.

('73', 95, 2, 3, 193442) [April 13, 1938] 1
('73', 95, 3, 4, 193461) DEAR SIR NAZIMUDDIN, In accordance with the understanding of yesterday, I submit herewith my suggestions : (1) I understand that the detenus, including the Regulation III prisoners, will be discharged and all restrictions upon their liberty will be removed inside of one month from this date.
('73', 95, 3, 5, 193754) I can only hope that I shall not have to return to Calcutta in that connection.
('73', 95, 3, 6, 193834) Should my presence, however, be required, I shall gladly come whenever wanted.
('73', 95, 3, 7, 193913) (2) With regard to the convicted political prisoners I suggest that (A) the ailing prisoners should be discharged forthwith irrespective of their terms of imprisonment; (B) those who have less than 6 months to serve should be discharged forthwith; (C) those who have 18 months or less, but over 6 months to serve, should be discharged within 3 months; (D) those who have longer terms than 18 months to serve should be discharged within one year at the most.
('73', 95, 3, 8, 194371) (3) Those releases should be contingent upon a public understanding between the Government and the Opposition, that is, the Congress Party, to the effect that (A) there shall be no public demonstrations or processions in honour of those detenus or prisoners who may be discharged; (B) there should be no agitation, directly or indirectly, initiated or countenanced by the Congress Party to depart from or improve upon the settlement that may be arrived at.
('73', 95, 3, 9, 194828) In other words, so far as Bengal at any rate is concerned, the question of the release of detenus and political prisoners shall cease to be a Party question or a
('73', 95, 4, 10, 194990) 1 Although the addressee in his letter of April 17 to Gandhiji acknowledges this as of the 12th, this was obviously written after the Statement to the Press, 1341938; vide the preceding item.

('73', 96, 1, 2, 195231) matter of public controversy.
('73', 96, 1, 3, 195261) I have purposely refrained from entering into any argument in favour of the suggestions made herein.
('73', 96, 1, 4, 195362) I have discussed them threadbare with you and you have very patiently listened to me.
('73', 96, 1, 5, 195448) Whatever the fate of the negotiations and suggestions, it is agreed between us that a final decision will be taken by the Bengal Government within a few days, certainly within one month from today.
('73', 96, 1, 6, 195646) You have told me that any assurances the prisoners or detenus may give me about non violence could not or would not be allowed by the Government to influence their decision.
('73', 96, 1, 7, 195820) But, as you know, I have interested myself in their cases on the strength of their disavowal of violence for the attainment of Indias freedom.
('73', 96, 1, 8, 195963) Therefore, for my own satisfaction, I discussed the question with them and whilst they did not want to make any statement for the sake of furthering their release, they assured me that they had no faith in violence for securing Indias freedom.
('73', 96, 1, 9, 196207) I believe in their assurance and it would be a pity if such men could not be discharged.
('73', 96, 1, 10, 196296) I forgot to mention one thing during our conversations of yesterday.
('73', 96, 1, 11, 196365) The prisoners at Dum Dum asked me whether I had received the many messages they had sent me through the usual channels.
('73', 96, 1, 12, 196485) I cannot recall having received any, except the messages from the Midnapur girl prisoners.
('73', 96, 1, 13, 196576) Whatever may have happened in the past, I trust that in future you will kindly issue instructions so as to ensure the delivery of their messages to me, assuming, of course, that they are not objectionable.

('73', 96, 3, 16, 197405) Secondly, what I endeavoured to convey at our last interview was simply thisthat, subject to an agreed solution of the problem of convicted prisoners being arrived at, I felt sure you would not be dissatisfied with the action that the Government would in that event take regarding State prisoners and detenus.

('73', 98, 2, 3, 199358) CALCUTTA, [April 13, 1938] 2
('73', 98, 3, 4, 199387) The difference between your view and mine is based on the question whether the Zemindari system is to be mended or ended.
('73', 98, 3, 5, 199509) I say it should be mended, and if it cannot be mended, it would end itself.
('73', 98, 3, 6, 199585) You say that it is incapable of being mended.
('73', 98, 4, 7, 199631) In these words Gandhiji summed up the difference between the Socialist school
('73', 98, 5, 8, 199709) and what may be called the Satyagrahi school, before an informal meeting of Calcutta
('73', 98, 6, 9, 199794) Congressmen.
('73', 98, 7, 10, 199807) Q. The zemindars and mahajans are the instruments of the bureaucracy.
('73', 98, 8, 11, 199877) have always sided with it and are an obstacle to our progress and freedom.
('73', 98, 8, 12, 199952) Why should
('73', 98, 9, 13, 199963) not the obstacle be removed ?
('73', 98, 10, 14, 199993) A. They are indeed part and parcel of the bureaucracy.
('73', 98, 10, 15, 200048) But they are its helpless tools.
('73', 98, 10, 16, 200081) Must they for ever remain so?
('73', 98, 10, 17, 200111) We may do nothing to put them away from us.
('73', 98, 10, 18, 200155) If they change their mentality, their services can be utilized for the nation.
('73', 98, 10, 19, 200234) If they will not change, they will die a natural death.
('73', 98, 10, 20, 200290) If we have non violence in us, we will not frighten them.
('73', 98, 10, 21, 200348) We have to be doubly careful when the Congress has power.
('73', 98, 11, 22, 200406) Q. But cant we say the system of zemindari is an anachronism and should go, by non violent means of course?
('73', 98, 12, 23, 200514) A. Of course we can.
('73', 98, 12, 24, 200535) The question is: must we ? Why can we not say to the zemindars, These are the evils which we ask you to remove yourselves?
('73', 98, 12, 25, 200658) I admit that this presumes trust in human nature.
('73', 98, 13, 26, 200708) Q. Would you say that the Permanent Settlement 3 should remain ?
('73', 98, 14, 27, 200773) A. No, it has to go.
('73', 98, 14, 28, 200794) The way to make the kisans happy and prosperous is to educate them to know the reason of their present condition and how to mend it.
('73', 98, 14, 29, 200927) We may show them the non violent way or the violent.
('73', 98, 14, 30, 200980) The latter may look tempting, but it is the way to perdition in the long run.

('73', 99, 1, 2, 201332) Q. But dont you agree that the land belongs to him who tills it ?
('73', 99, 2, 3, 201398) A. I do.
('73', 99, 2, 4, 201407) But that need not mean that the zemindar should be wiped out.
('73', 99, 2, 5, 201469) The man who supplies brains and metal is as much a tiller as the one who labours with his hands.
('73', 99, 2, 6, 201566) What we aim at, or should, is to remove the present terrible inequality between them.
('73', 99, 3, 7, 201652) Q. But the mending process may be very long.
('73', 99, 4, 8, 201697) A. Seemingly the longest process is often the shortest.
('73', 99, 5, 9, 201753) Q. But why not parcel out the land among the tillers ?
('73', 99, 6, 10, 201808) A. That is a hasty thought.
('73', 99, 6, 11, 201836) The land is today in their hands.
('73', 99, 6, 12, 201870) But they know neither their rights nor how to exercise them.
('73', 99, 6, 13, 201931) Supposing they were told neither to move out of the land nor to pay the dues to the zemindars, do you think their misery would be over?
('73', 99, 6, 14, 202067) Surely much will still remain to be done.
('73', 99, 6, 15, 202109) I suggest that that should be undertaken now and the rest will follow as day follows night.
('73', 99, 7, 16, 202201) That led up to the question of the Kisan Sabhas, their relations with the Congress, their scope and their function.
('73', 99, 7, 17, 202317) My opinion is clear cut, having worked among the kisans and labour all my life.
('73', 99, 7, 18, 202397) There is nothing constitutionally wrong in the Congress allowing the Kisan Sabhas to work independently nor in allowing the office bearers of the Kisan Sabhas to be office bearers of the Congress, for they will come in the usual way.
('73', 99, 7, 19, 202631) But my study of separate kisan organizations has led me definitely to the conclusion that they are not working for the interests of the kisans but are organized only with a view to capturing the Congress organization.
('73', 99, 7, 20, 202849) They can do even this by leading the kisans along the right channels, but I am afraid they are misleading them.
('73', 99, 7, 21, 202961) If the kisans and their leaders will capture the Congress by doing nothing but authorized Congress work, there is no harm.
('73', 99, 7, 22, 203084) But if they do so by making false registers, storming meetings and so on, it would be something like Fascism.
('73', 99, 7, 23, 203194) But the main question is whether you want the Kisan Sabhas to strengthen the Congress or to weaken it, to use the kisan organization to capture the Congress or to serve the kisans, whether the Sabha is to be a rival organization working apparently in the name of the Congress or one carrying out the Congress programme and policy.
('73', 99, 7, 24, 203525) If it is really a rival organization and Congress organization only in name, its strength and energy will be utilized in resisting the Congress and those of the Congress will be utilized in resiting the Kisan Sabha,

('73', 100, 4, 6, 204154) In these days when irreligion masquerades as religion, it is well to reminds ourselves of what the best minds of all the religions of the world have thought and said.
('73', 100, 4, 7, 204321) We must not, like the frog in the well who imagines that the universe ends with the wall surrounding his well, think that our religion alone represents the whole Truth and all the others are false.
('73', 100, 4, 8, 204519) A reverent study of the other religions of the world would show that they are equally true as our own, though all are necessarily imperfect.

('73', 101, 2, 3, 205343) April 14, 1938
('73', 101, 3, 4, 205358) NARANDAS, Give the enclosed 1 to Ratubhai.
('73', 101, 3, 5, 205401) Kanaiyo is quite happy.
('73', 101, 3, 6, 205425) I do feel unhappy that I am not able to pay the attention that I ought to pay him.
('73', 101, 3, 7, 205508) If I could but manage it, I could take much work from him.
('73', 101, 3, 8, 205567) I am fairly well.
('73', 101, 3, 9, 205585) I am writing this in a moving train.
('73', 101, 3, 10, 205622) I hope everything is well with you.
('73', 101, 3, 11, 205658) Are you quite satisfied with Kamala?
('73', 101, 3, 12, 205695) I return to Wardha the day after tomorrow.

('73', 101, 6, 16, 205842) 101. LETTER TO KANTILAL GANDHI
('73', 101, 7, 17, 205873) ON THE TRAIN TO DELHI, April 14, 1938
('73', 101, 8, 18, 205911) KANTI, You have done something really excellent.
('73', 101, 8, 19, 205960) 2 Act in the same manner in future also.
('73', 101, 8, 20, 206001) And now the answers to your questions 3. 1. It has not been my experience that in daily life it is untruth and dishonesty that always triumph.
('73', 101, 8, 21, 206144) We of course come across instances of these sometimes winning, but if we look deep into the matter we shall see that the real triumph goes to truth.
('73', 101, 9, 22, 206293) 1 Vide the preceding item.
('73', 101, 10, 23, 206320) 2 The addressee had helped an old Mussalman fellow passenger on the train who had lost his ticket (Harijan, 14 5 1938).
('73', 101, 11, 24, 206440) 3 These, briefly, were: (I) Would it not have been proper for the ticketless passenger to evade the ticket examiner?
('73', 101, 11, 25, 206557) Didnt dishonesty often pay ?
('73', 101, 11, 26, 206586) (ii) How far was it proper for the addressee to advise him to be honest ?
('73', 101, 11, 27, 206660) (iii) What right had the ticket examiner to let the passenger off ?
('73', 101, 11, 28, 206728) (iv) Not himself having any money to pay, how could the addressee have appealed to other passengers to pay the ticketless passengers fare ?
('73', 101, 11, 29, 206868) (v) If the passenger could complete his journey to Madras, would it have been right for the addressee to see him out of the platform on a platform ticket ?
('73', 102, 0, 1, 207024) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 103
('73', 102, 1, 2, 207074) If, however, the victory of truth was always self evident, what would be its value, and what would be the merit of adhering to it?
('73', 102, 1, 3, 207205) Is not this the reason why the Ishopanishad, which is regarded as authoritative as the Vedas has this mantra, that the face of truth is covered with a golden lid?
('73', 102, 1, 4, 207368) We are dazzled by the splendour of that lid.
('73', 102, 1, 5, 207413) 2. Now the second question.
('73', 102, 1, 6, 207441) It may not be our lot always to suffer, but that doesnt mean that we shouldt advise other people to follow the seemingly strait and narrow path of truth.
('73', 102, 1, 7, 207595) Even if the old man had been able to hide himself and reach Madras, what would it have availed?
('73', 102, 1, 8, 207691) Where was the guarantee that he would not have got caught somewhere?
('73', 102, 1, 9, 207760) And why should we assume that he had to suffer because finally he had to get down?
('73', 102, 1, 10, 207843) We dont always know what is for our good.
('73', 102, 1, 11, 207885) We should, there fore, proceed blindly on the asump tion that the path of truth cannot but lead to our good.
('73', 102, 1, 12, 207994) 3. It was certainly within the right of the ticket examiner to let that man go.
('73', 102, 1, 13, 208074) If, however, he did not think he had such a right, he could not have neglected his duty out of false pity.
('73', 102, 1, 14, 208181) But even in that case he could have issued the man a ticket and paid for it from his own pocket or could have collected the money from other passen gers.
('73', 102, 1, 15, 208335) 4. Supposing the examiner did not let the man travel, nor issued him a ticket with his own money, and the old man had therefore to miss the train or go to jail, why should he have minded that?
('73', 102, 1, 16, 208528) If he was a lover of truth, he should have faced that cheerfully.
('73', 102, 1, 17, 208594) And we are thinking here about the duty of a lover of truth.
('73', 102, 1, 18, 208655) Even though you are not maintaining yourself with money earned by yourself, on an occasion like this, which arises only once in a while, you could have paid something yourself and collected the balance from the other passengers.
('73', 102, 1, 19, 208884) If the latter had paid anything, so far so good; but even if they hadnt, you would have done your duty.
('73', 102, 1, 20, 208988) But I didnt feel, either, that even the little you did was not enough.
('73', 102, 1, 21, 209059) 5. Had the examiner let the man travel to Madras, he could have informed the ticket collector there that he had used his discretion in letting him go.
('73', 102, 1, 22, 209210) But supposing he had refused to do that, it would not have been right for the old man to get out of the station with the help of a platform ticket.
('73', 102, 1, 23, 209358) However, the way out of that situation would have been easy.
('73', 102, 1, 24, 209419) You yourself could have explained his condition to the ticket collector and if the latter had not been con vinced he could have kept the man in custody.
('73', 102, 1, 25, 209572) These days, however,
('73', 103, 0, 1, 209593) 104 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 103, 1, 2, 209635) they dont follow that practice since it puts the railway company to a loss; the ticket collector merely shouts angrily at such persons and lets them go.
('73', 103, 1, 3, 209788) If you have any doubts even after reading these answers to your questions, ask me again.

('73', 104, 8, 16, 211818) I must however ask one question.
('73', 104, 8, 17, 211851) Did you think it lawful to sexually love the married lady or do you say that although it was wrong you could not help yourselves, and having fallen, the only honourable course for you was to marry ?
('73', 104, 8, 18, 212050) 3 I need to know this, if I may, to see how far we have drifted from each other and what philosophy guides us.
('73', 104, 8, 19, 212161) The fact that you are a seeker of Truth is enough to sustain the bond between us.
('73', 104, 8, 20, 212243) I hope you are completely cured.

('73', 105, 7, 19, 213532) Quite inconclusive.
('73', 105, 7, 20, 213552) It was not meant to be conclusive.
('73', 105, 7, 21, 213587) It was an exchange of ideas.
('73', 105, 7, 22, 213616) More when we meet.
('73', 105, 7, 23, 213635) You must make yourself fit in Simla.

('73', 106, 2, 4, 214217) SUSHILA, Lately you have been figuring in my dreams.
('73', 106, 2, 5, 214270) Shall I call it attachment or love?
('73', 106, 2, 6, 214306) Be that as it may, you have become a big question mark for me.
('73', 106, 2, 7, 214369) You have already taken one; you want to take the other one too ? These words of Mother still echo in my ears.
('73', 106, 2, 8, 214479) Her concern was justified.
('73', 106, 2, 9, 214506) My duty is clear.
('73', 106, 2, 10, 214524) At least today your place is not with me.
('73', 106, 2, 11, 214566) If Pyarelal finds his moorings, it will be well.
('73', 106, 2, 12, 214615) But if that does not happen I shall consider myself worthless.
('73', 106, 2, 13, 214678) And what can a girl like you do by living with a worthless person?
('73', 106, 2, 14, 214745) There is no strong reason for you to leave your mothers lap.
('73', 106, 2, 15, 214806) I failed in my duty when I let you ignore the letter from Delhi.
('73', 106, 2, 16, 214871) You should have accepted one of the jobs offered.
('73', 106, 2, 17, 214921) Even now if the posts have not been filled, you may still write, It so happens that I can now entertain one of the pro positions, if the posts or any of them be still open. 1 Your duty is to be near Mother and earn.
('73', 106, 2, 18, 215137) And even while you earn, increase your know ledge as much as you wish.
('73', 106, 2, 19, 215208) This is my considered view.
('73', 106, 2, 20, 215236) Mahadev will say the same.
('73', 106, 2, 21, 215263) I shall convey this to Pyarelal.
('73', 106, 2, 22, 215296) If he has anything else to say, I shall write again.
('73', 106, 2, 23, 215349) Stop worrying about me.
('73', 106, 2, 24, 215373) The night passed well.
('73', 106, 2, 25, 215396) In the morning the blood pressure was 164/102. Even otherwise I am feeling fine.
('73', 106, 2, 26, 215477) How can I forget the service I had from you?
('73', 106, 2, 27, 215522) How can I reward it?
('73', 106, 2, 28, 215543) How and why should a father reward a daughter?
('73', 106, 2, 29, 215590) God will reward you.
('73', 106, 2, 30, 215611) It will be reward enough if Pyarelals mind becomes quiet.
('73', 106, 2, 31, 215669) If that does not happen, what good will be a reward?
('73', 106, 2, 32, 215722) You did your duty.
('73', 106, 2, 33, 215741) Why should you be concerned with the fruits of it?
('73', 106, 2, 34, 215792) You must go on writing to me.

('73', 107, 2, 3, 216075) April 16, 1938 CHI.
('73', 107, 2, 4, 216095) PYARELAL, Now you may know the reason why I feel light at heart.
('73', 107, 2, 5, 216160) If I want to act on your letter, who is there to stop me?
('73', 107, 2, 6, 216218) But you should know my decision.
('73', 107, 2, 7, 216251) Sushilas pure love has showed me the way.
('73', 107, 2, 8, 216293) For your sake she is starving herself.
('73', 107, 2, 9, 216332) I was overawed when I learnt about it.
('73', 107, 2, 10, 216371) There is no pretence, no outward show.
('73', 107, 2, 11, 216410) I was terribly perturbed.
('73', 107, 2, 12, 216436) If Sushila has to starve herself as she is doing, is my love so only in name or does it serve any purpose?
('73', 107, 2, 13, 216543) Mothers tears made me resolve that if Pyarelals life could be put on the rails then I would be qualified to keep Sushila.
('73', 107, 2, 14, 216665) If that does not happen, I would stand disqualified in my own eyes.
('73', 107, 2, 15, 216733) If my non violence is not capable of melting your heart, how would it help in winning swaraj?
('73', 107, 2, 16, 216827) You have become part of me.
('73', 107, 2, 17, 216855) If I cannot keep you, I am worthless.
('73', 107, 2, 18, 216893) Mothers words were not the words of an ignorant woman.
('73', 107, 2, 19, 216948) Her candid words emanated from her great anguish.
('73', 107, 2, 20, 216998) They went direct to my heart, and she was fully entitled to tell me all she did.
('73', 107, 2, 21, 217079) When others hear such words of truth, it will only benefit them.
('73', 107, 2, 22, 217144) Hence, at that time I lightened my heart by taking the decision that if Pyarelal cannot convince me of the justice of the step he wishes to take, he should give up his fast, whether complete or partial.
('73', 107, 2, 23, 217347) If in his innermost heart he cannot be persuaded, he can by all means abide by his decision and then I will eat when he eats and starve when he starves.
('73', 107, 2, 24, 217500) When he fasts I will fast too.
('73', 107, 2, 25, 217531) If he should leave, my fast will commence from that very moment.
('73', 107, 2, 26, 217596) This thought occurred to me after I heard about Sushila.
('73', 107, 2, 27, 217653) I made my resolve after seeing Mothers anguish.
('73', 107, 2, 28, 217701) She will tell you everything on reaching home.
('73', 107, 2, 29, 217748) God has willed otherwise.
('73', 107, 2, 30, 217774) If you go from here, you will be breaking your vow.
('73', 107, 2, 31, 217826) I cannot quietly sit at Segaon till the visit to the Frontier Province materializes.
('73', 107, 2, 32, 217911) And (at Segaon), you should start nothing until I am settled there (Segaon).
('73', 107, 2, 33, 217988) But this is making a mountain out of a mole hill.
('73', 107, 2, 34, 218038) A new phase has begun for me.
('73', 107, 2, 35, 218068) My love for you will be as much asfor swaraj.
('73', 107, 2, 36, 218114) If the spark that Sushila has kindled is enough, God will grant me the strength to quietly adhere to my resolve.
('73', 107, 2, 37, 218227) If you have become part of me, then your duty is clear.
('73', 107, 2, 38, 218283) You must do as I say.
('73', 107, 2, 39, 218305) By doing so, you will benefit yourself, me, Sushila and Mother, who is like a cow.
('73', 107, 2, 40, 218388) Then all of us will strive together for

('73', 108, 1, 2, 218478) swaraj.
('73', 108, 1, 3, 218486) The happiness and peace of many others like Mahadev, for instance depend on your peace of mind.
('73', 108, 1, 4, 218582) If you can believe it, do this much in good faith.
('73', 108, 1, 5, 218633) Nothing should be given up for fear that I may resort to fasting.
('73', 108, 1, 6, 218699) Duty should never be forgotten.
('73', 108, 1, 7, 218731) If you think that it is clearly your duty to go, who am I to stand in the way?
('73', 108, 1, 8, 218810) If there is any room for the slightest doubt, give the benefit of it to me whom you have accepted as father.

('73', 108, 5, 15, 219137) PYARELAL, I had finished writing the enclosed 2 when Sushila gave me your letter.
('73', 108, 5, 16, 219219) You did not quite understand.
('73', 108, 5, 17, 219249) What I had decided is mentioned in the enclosed letter.
('73', 108, 5, 18, 219305) Even if deep down Sushila has any misgivings as to what may be good for her, she must submit to Mothers love.
('73', 108, 5, 19, 219415) But if she feels that it is to her good to be here she must remain firm and put up with Mothers lamentations.
('73', 108, 5, 20, 219525) I wanted to take back the letter today.
('73', 108, 5, 21, 219565) In my opinion, from all points of view, Sushilas good lies in being here.
('73', 108, 5, 22, 219639) But even you may not agree on that point.
('73', 108, 5, 23, 219681) I am not enamoured of medical degrees nor for that matter [education] in England.
('73', 108, 5, 24, 219763) Those who learn do so after getting their degrees.
('73', 108, 5, 25, 219814) But this is my position.
('73', 108, 5, 26, 219839) I have written this to show how myviews about someones good can appear distorted and short sighted.
('73', 108, 5, 27, 219939) Hence if there is any need for thinking, it has to be done only by Sushila.
('73', 108, 5, 28, 220015) Blessings form BAPU [PS.] It is true that Mahadev should have informed me.
('73', 108, 5, 29, 220090) But now that is over.
('73', 108, 5, 30, 220112) Here we have a situation where Ba worships Sushila.

('73', 109, 3, 4, 220592) BHAI GHANSHYAMDAS, What you say is correct from the economic point of view; but I look at it, and I ought to look at it, as a purely political issue.
('73', 109, 3, 5, 220742) 2 We cannot enter into any agreement with Lancashire which will bind us to buy their cloth.
('73', 109, 3, 6, 220834) The argument that Lancashire cloth is bound to come here anyway is irrelevant.
('73', 109, 3, 7, 220913) There has been no change in the Congress position, as it has always been explained to the people, as regards Lancashire cloth.
('73', 109, 3, 8, 221040) I think, therefore, that we cannot enter into the sort of agreement you suggest.

('73', 109, 11, 18, 221408) 1 The addressee in his letter dated April 17 had written: I thought I might clear the point again as regards the Indo British Trade Pact.
('73', 109, 11, 19, 221546) The period of protection expires next March and in any case the amount of protection will be revised.
('73', 109, 11, 20, 221648) I believe that Lancashire would in any case get a 5% reduction in the tariff.
('73', 109, 11, 21, 221726) The question therefore is: should we give Lancashire a grant of 5% under the recommendations of the Tariff Board without asking for any quid pro quo or should we insist on a pact based on 5% reduction and a definite guarantee by Lancashire to purchase a large amount of Indian cotton?
('73', 109, 11, 22, 222011) Purely from the economic point of view, we would not think of giving a free gift of 5%.
('73', 109, 11, 23, 222099) But from the political point of view there may be reasons for taking up such an attitude.
('73', 109, 11, 24, 222189) I should like you therefore to send me, at your leisure, your arguments in favour of such a position which, you will agree, would appear to be anomalous from the economic point of view.
('73', 109, 11, 25, 222375) Because under this position Lancashire will get what she wants without having to pay anything for it. 2 Ibid

('73', 113, 8, 15, 226396) He says he had a talk with Jamnalalji about sending Ba.
('73', 113, 8, 16, 226452) He will certainly send her if she can be sent.

('73', 114, 1, 2, 227577) 120. SPEECH AT VIDYAMANDIR TRAINING SCHOOL, WARDHA 1
('73', 114, 2, 3, 227630) April 21, 1938 Today the students of the Vidyamandir have taken a solemn pledge.
('73', 114, 2, 4, 227711) It is a momentous pledge.
('73', 114, 2, 5, 227737) Its fulfilment would seem well nigh impossible.
('73', 114, 2, 6, 227785) This pledge binds one to serve without a break for twenty five years on a monthly salary of Rs. 15. The fact that more than five thousand applications 2 were received is proof that unemploment in our country has reached the extreme limit.
('73', 114, 2, 7, 228024) Some persons, while working for high ideals cannot get even dal and rice; many persons cannot obtain work to fill their bellies.
('73', 114, 2, 8, 228153) 3 It is also proof of the glamour that surrounds Government employment.
('73', 114, 2, 9, 228225) I know that people apply for constableships or teacherships in the hope of adding to their legal pay in illegal ways.
('73', 114, 2, 10, 228343) I hope that no one of you entertains any such hope.
('73', 114, 2, 11, 228395) I do not know that with all my patriotism I could bind myself to serve as a teacher for Rs. 15 per month.
('73', 114, 2, 12, 228501) You must dismiss from your minds the thought that there may be profits left over in your schools to be divided amongst you.
('73', 114, 2, 13, 228625) If, therefore, there is anyone among you who repents of the contract, you will ask the Minister to relieve you.
('73', 114, 2, 14, 228737) I promise to plead for you.
('73', 114, 2, 15, 228765) Having said this, I tender my congratu lations to those who hold to their contract.
('73', 114, 2, 16, 228849) I hope that God will give you strength to abide by your pledge.
('73', 114, 2, 17, 228913) Yours is a self sacrificing pledge.
('73', 114, 2, 18, 228949) If you prove true to your pledge you will set a noble example before the world.
('73', 114, 2, 19, 229029) If you do not succeed, both Ravishankar Shukla and I will be condemed by the world.
('73', 114, 2, 20, 229113) So the weaklings had better withdraw now.
('73', 114, 2, 21, 229155) This scheme is wholly Indian.
('73', 114, 2, 22, 229185) Its ideal was born in Segaon.
('73', 114, 2, 23, 229215) Real India is enshrined in the seven lakhs of villages, whose plight is even worse than Segaons.
('73', 114, 2, 24, 229312) I want you to drive away illiteracy from these villages, find out means whereby villagers can obtain food and cloth ing, and take the message of winning swaraj through truth and non violence to the villages.
('73', 114, 2, 25, 229520) This responsibility rests on you.
('73', 114, 2, 26, 229554) It is your

('73', 115, 1, 3, 229915) I have presented my scheme after mature deliberation.
('73', 115, 1, 4, 229969) If it fails, the teachers would be to blame.
('73', 115, 1, 5, 230014) It is through handicrafts that instruction in geometry, history, geography and arithmetic will be given and an attempt will be made to meet the expenses of the school through the students manual labour.
('73', 115, 2, 6, 230217) You know that the scheme of this education has been drawn up in pursuance of the Congress programme.
('73', 115, 2, 7, 230318) Now the Congress is pledged to win swaraj by non violent and truthful means.
('73', 115, 2, 8, 230395) Therefore the cultivation of these cardinal virtues is the foundation of the scheme.
('73', 115, 2, 9, 230480) And if you do not show these in your daily contact with yourpupils and a character in keeping with them, you will fail and so will your school.
('73', 115, 2, 10, 230624) You know what Hitler is doing in Germany.
('73', 115, 2, 11, 230666) His creed is violence, of which he makes no secret.
('73', 115, 2, 12, 230718) The other day we were told that the sword was their soul.
('73', 115, 2, 13, 230776) The boys and girls there are taught the science of violence from the beginning.
('73', 115, 2, 14, 230856) They are taught to hate the enemy even in their arithmetic, and you will find that the examples have been chosen with a view to inculcate the military spirit.
('73', 115, 2, 15, 231015) If we endorse their creed, we must recognize the necessity of inculcating the spirit of violence from infancy.
('73', 115, 2, 16, 231126) The same thing is happening in Italy.
('73', 115, 2, 17, 231164) We must be honest even as they are honest.
('73', 115, 2, 18, 231207) I have no doubt that if the scheme is worked with all its implications and becomes popular throughout India, a silent revolution will have taken place and swaraj will be a certainty.
('73', 115, 2, 19, 231390) Herr Hitler is achieving his goal through the sword, I through soul.
('73', 115, 2, 20, 231459) Cast off the cloak of foreign thoughts and ideals, identify yourselves with the villagers.
('73', 115, 2, 21, 231550) The Western world is giving us destru ctive knowledge; we want to impart constructive education through non violence.

('73', 116, 1, 2, 231935) 121. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS
('73', 116, 2, 3, 231963) April 22, 1938 I observe that the forthcoming interview between Shri Jinnah and myself is not only attracting very wide attention, but is also inducing high hopes in some.
('73', 116, 2, 4, 232135) Then there are friends who gravely warn me against this visit and against building any hope on the interview.
('73', 116, 2, 5, 232245) It is better, therefore, for me to take the public into my confidence and tell them why and how I am waiting upon Shri Jinnah on April 28. He has himself published my first letter 1 to him, showing my attitude on the question of communal unity, which is as dear to me as life itself.
('73', 116, 2, 6, 232529) In that letter I clearly stated that all before me was darkness and that I was praying for light.
('73', 116, 2, 7, 232627) If anything, the darkness has deepened and the prayer become more intense.
('73', 116, 2, 8, 232702) Add to this the fact that for causes some of which I know and some of which I do not, for the first time in my public and private life I seem to have lost self confidence.
('73', 116, 2, 9, 232874) I seem to have detected a flaw in me which is unworthy of a votary of truth and ahimsa.
('73', 116, 2, 10, 232962) I am going through a process of self introspection, the results of which I cannot foresee.
('73', 116, 2, 11, 233053) I find myself for the first time during the past 50 years in a Slough of Despond.
('73', 116, 2, 12, 233135) I do not consider myself fit for negotiations or any such thing for the moment.
('73', 116, 2, 13, 233215) There is no need for any speculation as to the cause of my despondency.
('73', 116, 2, 14, 233287) It is purely internal.
('73', 116, 2, 15, 233310) It comes from within.
('73', 116, 2, 16, 233332) It must be now clear that, if I regarded the forthcoming interview as between two politicians, I should not entertain it in my present depression.
('73', 116, 2, 17, 233479) But I approach it in no political spirit.
('73', 116, 2, 18, 233521) I approach it in a prayerful and religious spirit, using the adjective in its broadest sense.
('73', 116, 2, 19, 233615) My Hinduism is not sectarian.
('73', 116, 2, 20, 233645) It includes all that I know to be best in Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism.
('73', 116, 2, 21, 233737) I approach politics as everything else in a religious spirit.
('73', 116, 2, 22, 233799) Truth is my religion and ahimsa is the only way of its realization.
('73', 116, 2, 23, 233867) I have rejected once and for all the doctrine of the sword.
('73', 116, 2, 24, 233927) The secret stabbings of innocent persons and the speeches I read in the papers are hardly the thing leading to peace or an honourable settlement.

('73', 117, 1, 2, 234156) Again, I am not approaching the forthcoming interview in any representative capacity.
('73', 117, 1, 3, 234242) I have purposely divested myself of any such.
('73', 117, 1, 4, 234288) It there are to be any formal negotiations, they will be between the President of the Congress and the President of the Muslim League.
('73', 117, 1, 5, 234423) I go as a lifelong worker in the cause of Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 117, 1, 6, 234485) It has been my passion from early youth.
('73', 117, 1, 7, 234526) I count some of the noblest of Muslims as my friends.
('73', 117, 1, 8, 234580) I have a devout daughter of Islam as more than a daughter to me.
('73', 117, 1, 9, 234645) She lives for that unity and would cheerfully die for it.
('73', 117, 1, 10, 234703) I had the son 1 of the late Muazzin of the Juma Masjid of Bombay as a staunch inmate of the Ashram.
('73', 117, 1, 11, 234803) I have not met a nobler man.
('73', 117, 1, 12, 234832) His morning azan 2 in the Ashram rings in my ears as I write these lines during midnight.
('73', 117, 1, 13, 234922) It is for such reasons that I wait on Shri Jinnah.
('73', 117, 1, 14, 234973) I may not leave a single stone unturned to achieve Hindu Muslim unity.
('73', 117, 1, 15, 235044) God fulfils himself in strange ways.
('73', 117, 1, 16, 235081) He may, in a manner least known to us, both fulfil himself through the interview and open a way to an honourable understanding between the two communities.
('73', 117, 1, 17, 235237) It is in that hope that I am looking forward to the forthcoming talk.
('73', 117, 1, 18, 235307) We are friends, not strangers.
('73', 117, 1, 19, 235338) It does not matter to me that we see things from different angles of vision.
('73', 117, 1, 20, 235415) I ask the public not to attach any exaggerated importance to the interview.
('73', 117, 1, 21, 235491) But I ask all lovers of communal peace to pray that the God of truth and love may give us both the right spirit and the right word and use us for the good of the dumb millions of India.

('73', 117, 5, 25, 235766) Everyone who cares to study what is happening at the present moment in our country can see that what we want can be attained if we will but achieve the mantra of peace, the creed of non violence.
('73', 117, 5, 26, 235962) You cannot breed peace out of no peace.
('73', 117, 5, 27, 236002) The attempt is like gathering

('73', 117, 6, 29, 236119) The message was sent throught Jamnalal Bajaj who presided over the Conference.
('73', 117, 6, 30, 236198) 4 Although the message was read out at the Conference by Jamnalal Bajaj on April 30, this was obviously drafted before April 23; vide Letter to Jamnalal Bajaj, 23 4 1938

('73', 118, 1, 2, 236418) grapes of thorns or figs of thistles.
('73', 118, 1, 3, 236456) The more I go into the question, the more forcibly the conclusion is borne in upon me that our first duty is to grasp this fundamental fact.
('73', 118, 1, 4, 236597) There was a day when I used to flatter myself with the belief that I had mastered the key to learning that lesson.
('73', 118, 1, 5, 236712) Today I am filled with doubt.
('73', 118, 1, 6, 236742) I do not know that I have in me purification enough to realize true peace or non violence.
('73', 118, 1, 7, 236833) In that frame of mind I cannot think of any other thing, talk of any other thing.
('73', 118, 1, 8, 236915) But whatever may be my condition, I have no doubt in my mind that there is no swaraj without non violence, nothing that goes by the name of constructive work.
('73', 118, 1, 9, 237074) Constructive work is a mild aspect of non violence, but the true test of non violence lies in acquiring the capacity to meet an innocent and unflinching death in the service of our cause.
('73', 118, 1, 10, 237262) How to achieve it is the question.
('73', 118, 1, 11, 237297) I want you to apply your minds to it.
('73', 118, 1, 12, 237335) Harijan, 4 6 1938
('73', 118, 2, 13, 237353) 123. MARTIAL V. MORAL
('73', 118, 3, 14, 237375) It is often forgotten that the Congress has only moral authority to back it.
('73', 118, 3, 15, 237452) The ruling power has the martial, though it often dilutes the martial with the moral.
('73', 118, 3, 16, 237538) This vital difference has come to the fore since the assumption of office by the Congress in seven provinces.
('73', 118, 3, 17, 237648) This office holding is either a step towards greater prestige or its total loss.
('73', 118, 3, 18, 237729) If it is not to be a total loss, the ministers and the legislators have to be watchful of their own personal and public conduct.
('73', 118, 3, 19, 237858) They have to be, like Caesars wife, above suspicion in everything.
('73', 118, 3, 20, 237925) They may not make private gains either for themselves or for their relatives or friends.
('73', 118, 3, 21, 238014) If the relatives or friends get any appointment, it must be only because they are the best among the candidates, and their market value is always greater than what they get under the Government.
('73', 118, 3, 22, 238209) The ministers and the legislators of the Congress ticket have to be fearless in the performance of their duty.
('73', 118, 3, 23, 238320) They must always be ready to risk the loss of their seats or offices.
('73', 118, 3, 24, 238390) Offices and seats in the legislatures have no merit outside their ability to raise the prestige and power of the Congress.
('73', 118, 3, 25, 238513) And since both depend wholly upon the possession of morals, both public and private, any moral lapse means a blow to the Congress.
('73', 118, 3, 26, 238644) This is the necessary implication of non violence.
('73', 118, 3, 27, 238695) If the Congress non violence is merely confined to abstention from causing physical hurt to the British officials and their dependants, such non violence can never bring us independence.
('73', 118, 3, 28, 238882) It is bound to be worsted
('73', 119, 0, 1, 238908) 120 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 119, 1, 2, 238950) in the final heat.
('73', 119, 1, 3, 238969) Indeed we shall find it to be worthless, if not positively harmful, long before the final heat is reached.
('73', 119, 1, 4, 239076) There is considerable force in the argument of those who have conceived Congress non violence in that narrow light when they say that it is a broken reed.
('73', 119, 1, 5, 239231) If on the other hand non violence, with all the implications, is the Congress policy, let every Congressman examine himself and reconstruct himself accordingly.
('73', 119, 1, 6, 239392) Let him not wait for instructions from the Working Committee.
('73', 119, 1, 7, 239454) After all the Working Committee can act only in so far as it interprets the public mind.
('73', 119, 1, 8, 239543) And non violence is not a quality to be evolved or expressed to order.
('73', 119, 1, 9, 239614) It is an inward growth depending for sustenance upon intense individual effort.
('73', 119, 1, 10, 239694) I have received several letters offering the writers names for enrolment as volunteers ready to immolate themselves at times of rioting and the like.
('73', 119, 1, 11, 239844) To these writers I would suggest that they enlist co workers themselves, form local corps, and begin training in accor dance with the suggestion I have made.
('73', 119, 1, 12, 240002) Let them not confine themselves merely to preparedness for emergencies, but for the daily walk of like in all its departments, personal, domestic, social, econo mic, political, religious.
('73', 119, 1, 13, 240190) Only thus will they find themselves more than ready for dealing with emergencies in their own localities or beats.
('73', 119, 1, 14, 240305) They may not aim, except indirectly, at influencing events happening hundreds of miles away from their scene of activity.
('73', 119, 1, 15, 240427) That ability will come, if the right beginning is made in the first instance.

('73', 121, 8, 18, 242886) CHI, SHARDA, It seems you are being sensible.
('73', 121, 8, 19, 242932) I had really thought that after my letter you had abandoned the idea of going to Ahmedabad, in which case you should have told me.
('73', 121, 8, 20, 243063) You had my permission, but I would want to know.
('73', 121, 8, 21, 243112) Now stay with Shakaribehn 3 to your hearts content.
('73', 121, 8, 22, 243164) Also tell her from me that there is a lot of difference between what she told me and what she had in mind.
('73', 121, 8, 23, 243271) She must talk to me without reserve.
('73', 121, 8, 24, 243308) She must let me know through you what she wants.
('73', 121, 8, 25, 243357) I do not intend doing anything against her wish.
('73', 121, 8, 26, 243406) Stay there as long as necessary on condition that you maintain your health.
('73', 121, 8, 27, 243482) Give me regular account of how you spend your time.
('73', 121, 8, 28, 243534) You should not be too sure of a letter from me.
('73', 121, 8, 29, 243582) I shall write to Saraswatibehn when I have the time.

('73', 122, 5, 11, 244240) 129. LETTER TO PRESIDENT, MYSORE STATE CONGRESS April [24,] 4 1938
('73', 122, 6, 12, 244307) DEAR FRIEND, B. Chandrasekhara, D. Chandrasekharayya, B. Ramachandran have seen me with reference to the recent unfortunate arrests that have taken place in Mysore.
('73', 122, 6, 13, 244472) I am sorry that Siddhalingaiya and seven other friends are in jail over what has been called the flag satyagraha.
('73', 122, 6, 14, 244586) I had hoped that after the full talks I had with friends including Siddhal ingaiya at Delang there would be no friction between the state and the Congress.
('73', 122, 6, 15, 244742) With the concurrence of these friends and their hearty approval I had given Sir Mirza a fairly full summary of the conver sation they had with me.
('73', 122, 6, 16, 244889) Sir Mirza had been writing to me about developments, but I was loath to intervene unless I had heard from the State Congress.
('73', 122, 6, 17, 245015) I must also admit that my preoccupation in Bengal would have most probably prevented my doing anything even if you or any member had written to me.
('73', 122, 6, 18, 245163) Today I had a full discussion with the friends above named.
('73', 122, 6, 19, 245223) I feel that there has been some misunderstand 
('73', 122, 7, 20, 245270) 1 The reference is to Hindu Muslim riots in Allahabad.
('73', 122, 7, 21, 245325) 2 Gandhiji is here referring to his proposed meeting with Jinnah.

('73', 122, 8, 23, 245432) 4 The source has 14.
('73', 122, 8, 24, 245453) But on April 14, Gandhiji was on way to Delhi from Calcutta.
('73', 122, 8, 25, 245514) Presumably it is a slip for 24.
('73', 122, 8, 26, 245546) The representatives from Mysore met Gandhiji at Wardha and they were in Bombay on the 26th on their way back to Mysore.
('73', 123, 0, 1, 245666) 124 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 123, 1, 2, 245708) ing or some haste on the part of overzealous workers.
('73', 123, 1, 3, 245762) Thus I had clearly advised at Delang that the confining of membership of the Mysore State Congress only to primary members of the Indian National Congress was wholly wrong and that in effect it made the State Congress an Indian National Congress organization even though it might be unaffiliated.
('73', 123, 1, 4, 246059) In my opinion that is contrary to the spirit of the Haripura resolution 1 on the subject and, what is more, calculated to defeat the end you have in view.
('73', 123, 1, 5, 246214) And as Sir Mirza was in possession of my opinion, the action of the State Congress in spite of my advice was evidently the first cause of misunderstanding and the hoisting of the flag was evidently interpreted as a challenge to the State and the State Flag.
('73', 123, 1, 6, 246472) I am quite clear in my mind that such was not the intention of the authors of the demonstration but we may not expect the State authorities to go behind our action and interpret it in terms of our intention expressed or implied.
('73', 123, 1, 7, 246701) On the contrary they would infer intention from action.
('73', 123, 1, 8, 246757) I, therefore, suggest that necessary change is immediately made in the State Congress constitution and an unequivocal declaration is made to the effect that the hoisting of the National Congress flag is in no way intended as a hostile demons tration or insult to the State flag.
('73', 123, 1, 9, 247036) If Mysore is an integral part of India, as it is, it should be equally proud of the All India national flag as it must be of its own.
('73', 123, 1, 10, 247170) It will also be necessary for you to make it clear that you will not hoist the national flag on ceremonial occasions where persons other than registered Congress members are admitted, unless you also at the same time hoist the Mysore flag.
('73', 123, 1, 11, 247410) Remember, you are not in a state of rebellion against the Maharaja.
('73', 123, 1, 12, 247478) So far as I understand you do not aim at the destruction of the Principality of Mysore.
('73', 123, 1, 13, 247566) You aim at
('73', 123, 2, 14, 247577) 1. The relevant part of the resolution read: In view of the different conditions prevailing in the States and the rest of India, the general policy of the Congress is often unsuited to the States and may result in preventing or hampering the natural growth of a freedom movement in a State.
('73', 123, 2, 15, 247868) Such movements are likely to develop more rapidly and to have a broader basis, if they draw their strength from the people of the State, produce self reliance in them, and are in tune with the conditions prevailing there, and do not rely on extraneous help and assistance or on the prestige of the Congress name.
('73', 123, 2, 16, 248181) The Congress welcomes such movements, but, in the nature of things and under present conditions, the burden of carrying on the struggle for freedom must fall on the people of the States.
('73', 123, 2, 17, 248368) The Congress will always extend its goodwill and support to such struggles carried on in a peaceful and legitimate manner, but that organizational help will inevitably be, under existing conditions, moral support and sympathy.

('73', 124, 1, 3, 248662) If such is the case, you may not ignore the Mysore flag on ceremonial occasions, if you have also the all India flag.
('73', 124, 1, 4, 248780) If, therefore, you could see your way to adopt my advice I should think that the State authorities will release the prisoners as they should.
('73', 124, 1, 5, 248922) When the operating cause ceases there is no meaning in keeping political prisoners in jail.
('73', 124, 1, 6, 249014) Please remember that satyagraha has to be full in thought, word and deed.
('73', 124, 1, 7, 249088) If I have understood the situation correctly, I must confess that albeit entirely unconscious, from both truth and non violence.
('73', 124, 1, 8, 249217) Truth demanded the carrying out of what I had understood would be done and I had conveyed to Sir Mirza.
('73', 124, 1, 9, 249321) I know it was open to the State Congress to reject my advice.
('73', 124, 1, 10, 249383) But in that case I should have been told so that I would have informed Sir Mirza accordingly.
('73', 124, 1, 11, 249477) There was a flavour of violence because any hasty or thoughtless action is a breach of non violence.
('73', 124, 1, 12, 249578) I am well aware that such meticulous observance of non violence and truth is not to be expected from the rank and file.
('73', 124, 1, 13, 249698) But then satyagraha cannot be launched by the rank and file.
('73', 124, 1, 14, 249759) It has to be launched by responsible persons who are versed in the law of satyagraha.
('73', 124, 1, 15, 249845) I understand there is to be a black flag demonstration.
('73', 124, 1, 16, 249901) It savours of violence.
('73', 124, 1, 17, 249925) I hope if there has been any such idea, it will be abandoned.
('73', 124, 1, 18, 249987) I need hardly say that my letter carries no authority save what it may possess on account of my supposed expert knowledge of satya graha.
('73', 124, 1, 19, 250125) You are at perfect liberty to reject the whole of my advice if it does not commend itself to you and other members of the State Congress.
('73', 124, 1, 20, 250263) If you can get permission, you should see Siddhalingaiya and other prisoners and if it is at all possible arrive at a unanimous decision.

('73', 125, 3, 4, 250621) We have to make of this training school a school for winning freedom and for the solution of all our ills, of which the chief one is our communal troubles.
('73', 125, 3, 5, 250777) For this purpose we shall have to concentrate on non violence.
('73', 125, 3, 6, 250840) Hitlers and Mussolinis schools accept as their fundamental principle violence.
('73', 125, 3, 7, 250919) Ours is non violence according to the Congress.
('73', 125, 3, 8, 250967) All our problems have therefore to be solved non violently.
('73', 125, 3, 9, 251027) Our arithmetic, our science, our history will have a non violent approach, and the problems in these subjects will be coloured by non violence.
('73', 125, 3, 10, 251171) When Madame Halide Edib Hanum delivered her address to the Jamia Millia Islamia on Turkey I remarked that whereas generally history is a chronicle of kings and their wars, the future history will be the history of man.
('73', 125, 3, 11, 251390) 3 That can be or is only non violent.
('73', 125, 3, 12, 251428) Then we shall have to concentrate not on city industries but on rural industries, that is to say, if we want to keep all the 700,000 of villages alive,and not only a fraction of them, we have to revive our village handicrafts.
('73', 125, 3, 13, 251655) And you may be sure that if we can impart scholastic training through those crafts we can bring about a revolution.
('73', 125, 3, 14, 251771) Our text books will have also to be prepared with the same end.
('73', 125, 3, 15, 251835) I want you to give your close consideration to what I am saying and reject what does not appeal to you.
('73', 125, 3, 16, 251939) If what I say does not appeal to our Mussalman brethren, they may reject it summarily.
('73', 125, 3, 17, 252026) The non violence I want is not non violence limited to the fight with the British but is to be applied to all our internal affairs and problemstrue active non violence from which will issue live Hindu Muslim unity and not a unity based on mutual fear like the pact, for instance, between Hitler and Mussolini.
('73', 125, 3, 18, 252336) When the New Education Scheme was launched I was full of self confidence in which I now feel I am lacking.
('73', 125, 3, 19, 252443) My words had power of which they seem to be bereft today.
('73', 125, 3, 20, 252501) This lack of confidence is due not to things without but to things within.
('73', 125, 3, 21, 252576) It is not that my senses are paralysed.
('73', 125, 3, 22, 252616) My intellect gives me good work for my age.

('73', 126, 5, 17, 253579) I am sending a copy, of course, to the Brothers 2. I hope you will feel impelled to use your great influence over the Brothers.
('73', 126, 5, 18, 253707) I am of course in telegraphic communication.
('73', 126, 5, 19, 253752) I may even visit the Province for a few days, if Khan Saheb wants me to go, in spite of the shock I have received.
('73', 126, 5, 20, 253867) We seem to be weakening from within.
('73', 126, 5, 21, 253904) It hurts me that, at this very critical juncture in our history, we do not seem to see eye to eye in important matters.
('73', 126, 5, 22, 254024) I cant tell you how positively lonely I feel to know that nowadays I cant carry you with me.
('73', 126, 5, 23, 254117) I know that you would do much for affection.
('73', 126, 5, 24, 254162) But in matters of state, there can be no surrender to affection, when the intellect rebels.
('73', 126, 5, 25, 254254) My regard for you is deeper for your revolt.
('73', 126, 5, 26, 254299) But that only intensifies the grief of loneliness.

('73', 127, 3, 5, 254685) Nowadays I eagerly await your letter.
('73', 127, 3, 6, 254723) I couldnt bear the news that you had a fainting fit.
('73', 127, 3, 7, 254776) Moreover, is it not my unworthiness that you couldnt remain calm this time although you were with me?
('73', 127, 3, 8, 254878) I am not joking.
('73', 127, 3, 9, 254895) These days I often feel my unworthiness.
('73', 127, 3, 10, 254936) That hinders my work, too.
('73', 127, 3, 11, 254963) You have to rely on your own efforts to attain peace of mind.

('73', 127, 3, 13, 255069) Is there anything confidential in them?

('73', 127, 5, 22, 255456) Do give your approval, looking at it purely from the economic point of view.
('73', 127, 5, 23, 255533) My point was that in case you wanted Congress approval later on, you would not get it.
('73', 127, 5, 24, 255620) After all, economic and political interests should not be at variance.
('73', 127, 5, 25, 255691) There is no difference between them.
('73', 127, 5, 26, 255728) The rulers have taught us the difference.
('73', 127, 5, 27, 255770) I shall be needing Rs. 50,000 for rural education and maybe an equal amount for the A.I.V.I.A. The burden of the Harijan Sevak Sangh is already there.
('73', 127, 5, 28, 255921) This needs to be discussed further.

('73', 128, 12, 17, 257246) I dread the crowds that gather at stations.
('73', 128, 12, 18, 257290) I have only limited physical energy.
('73', 128, 12, 19, 257327) I would, therefore, urge all Congress Committees en route to prevent crowds from coming to platforms, making noisy demonstrations and even insisting on my getting up at all hours of night.

('73', 131, 1, 2, 260627) 142. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 1
('73', 131, 2, 3, 260657) April 29, 1938 The appointment of Mr. Dain, a subordinate of the Orissa Government, to be the acting Governor threatens to precipitate a crisis of the first magnitude.
('73', 131, 2, 4, 260825) The matter looked small on the surface.
('73', 131, 2, 5, 260865) The fact that he is to retire after the termination of the acting appointment has been regarded as sufficient atonement for an admitted mistake.
('73', 131, 2, 6, 261010) In my opinion it is no atonement.
('73', 131, 2, 7, 261044) If he is reverted to his original permanent post, not only would there not be anything wrong but if the Ministers wanted to be churlish, they might take a secret delight in their quondam acting Governor becoming their subordinate.
('73', 131, 2, 8, 261275) The whole of the sting lies in a subordinate official becoming an acting Governor of his Province with whom the Ministers are expected to work and almost daily submit documents for his signature and have him to preside at their meetings.
('73', 131, 2, 9, 261513) It is incongruous and unbecoming and reduces autonomy to a farce.
('73', 131, 2, 10, 261579) If this autonomy is real, and is to blossom forth into full freedom, nothing should be done by superior powers after the previous style.
('73', 131, 2, 11, 261716) Every one of their acts must conform to a rule or convention.
('73', 131, 2, 12, 261778) It must not depend upon the caprice of the Governor General or even the Secretary of state for India.
('73', 131, 2, 13, 261880) Wherever the prestige of autocracy depended upon its exacting obedience, willing or unwilling, from the ruled, the prestige of the superior authority that has voluntarily divested itself of autocracy and conferred autonomy should consist in always carrying the majority party with it.
('73', 131, 2, 14, 262165) There is no other way that I can think of for the healthy growth of autonomy and the avoidance of friction.
('73', 131, 2, 15, 262273) The Viceroy and the Governors have bestowed unstinted praise upon all the Ministers of India.
('73', 131, 2, 16, 262367) They have given no cause for the exercise of the more than ample powers reserved under the Govern ment of India Act.
('73', 131, 2, 17, 262484) The prestige of the majority party depends upon never sleeping over the rights of the people, never allowing a single error on the part of the superior authority to escape their vigilant eyes.
('73', 131, 2, 18, 262677) Looked at in this light, the Congress, it seems to me, cannot allow the appointment to pass unchallenged.
('73', 131, 2, 19, 262783) I hear that the Orissa Ministry has threatened to resign as soon
('73', 131, 3, 20, 262848) 1 This was published under the title Acting Governorship of Orissa.

('73', 132, 1, 2, 262966) as Mr. Dain occupies the gubernatorial chair.
('73', 132, 1, 3, 263012) I understand too that an interim Ministry will be appointed to carry on the Government.
('73', 132, 1, 4, 263100) I suppose that as soon as the acting appointment is over and the Gover nor returns from leave, by some arrangement the present Ministry will be reinstated.
('73', 132, 1, 5, 263256) That wont be fair play.
('73', 132, 1, 6, 263280) The Congress will stultify itself to submit to any such arrangement.
('73', 132, 1, 7, 263349) The governance of a province is not like a play of children.
('73', 132, 1, 8, 263410) The Congress is discovering what a thankless task it is, how serious it is.
('73', 132, 1, 9, 263486) The real Ministers, who represent the real majority of the Orissa legislators, cannot look unconcerned on the administration of their province passing into the hands of new irresponsible persons appointed at the will of the Governor or acting Governor as the case may be.
('73', 132, 1, 10, 263758) I do hope, therefore, that the mistake will be undone before it is too late.
('73', 132, 1, 11, 263835) There are many ways of doing it gracefully.
('73', 132, 1, 12, 263879) But there must be a will before a graceful way is found.
('73', 132, 1, 13, 263936) I hope it will be.

('73', 132, 4, 16, 264003) April 29, 1938 I enjoy the privilege of friendship with Sir Mirza Ismail.
('73', 132, 4, 17, 264077) I know that he is anxious to liberalize the administration of Mysore.
('73', 132, 4, 18, 264147) I have found him to be willing to listen to the advice and suggestions of friends.
('73', 132, 4, 19, 264230) And I know that the tragedy 3 which has been enacted in Mysore has filled him with distress.
('73', 132, 4, 20, 264323) I have read the communique issued by the Mysore Government.
('73', 132, 4, 21, 264383) It does not read convincing to me.
('73', 132, 4, 22, 264418) But for the advice that I am about to tender, I do not need an accurate knowledge of all the facts surrounding the tragedy.
('73', 132, 4, 23, 264542) Seeing that I receive pressing letters, depu tations and wires from representative people of Mysore for guidance, and seeing that I know so many workers of Mysore who look to me
('73', 132, 5, 24, 264720) 1 In response to this the Secretary to the Governor of Orissa issued the following communique on May 4, 1938: In view of the instability of the political situation which he would be bound to leave to his successor, His Excellency the Governor of Orissa does not feel justified in proceeding with his original plan, and considers that he has in the interests of the province no option but to ask for the cancellation of the leave granted to him.
('73', 132, 5, 25, 265165) The secretary of State has acceded to his request with the concurrence of the Governor general. 2 This was published under the title Price for Gaining Liberty.

('73', 133, 0, 1, 265374) 134 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 133, 1, 2, 265416) for a solution of their difficulties, it would be wrong on my part at this critical juncture to content myself merely with sending letters or even telegrams of advice.
('73', 133, 1, 3, 265584) One or two facts stand out prominently.
('73', 133, 1, 4, 265624) There has been firing upon an unarmed crowd, resulting in several deaths and many more being injured.
('73', 133, 1, 5, 265726) I will assume, though the information received by me on behalf of the public is to the contrary, that there was some provo cation.
('73', 133, 1, 6, 265857) We can never know with absolute certainty whether the firing was justified.
('73', 133, 1, 7, 265933) There is no code which can give an exact definition of justification.
('73', 133, 1, 8, 266003) It must always be a matter of opinion, and opinions always have a knack of varying.
('73', 133, 1, 9, 266087) What I, therefore, venture to suggest to the Mysore Government is that they should not be satisfied with making an inquiry, however impartial it may be.
('73', 133, 1, 10, 266240) The demonstration that is going on in Mysore about the national flag is a symptom of the time.
('73', 133, 1, 11, 266335) I must confess that I was not aware of a popular awakening in Mysore on a wide scale, as there undoubtedly is.
('73', 133, 1, 12, 266446) It gladdens me, as I hope it gladdens the Mysore authorities.
('73', 133, 1, 13, 266508) I suggest, therefore, that the best and only remedy for the Maharaja and his Adviser, Sir Mirza Ismail, is to divest the Government of its autocracy and to make popular representatives responsible for the administration of Mysore.
('73', 133, 1, 14, 266739) The responsibility must be on the broadest scale possible if it is to ensure peace in Mysore.
('73', 133, 1, 15, 266833) It has been suggested that the state being backward, responsibility can only be a plant of slow growth.
('73', 133, 1, 16, 266937) I have never subscribed to that doctrine.
('73', 133, 1, 17, 266979) It is not a compliment to the States.
('73', 133, 1, 18, 267017) One would expect them, with all the natural advantages in their favour, to show much greater progress than in unwieldy British India.
('73', 133, 1, 19, 267151) To the leaders of the people of Mysore I will say:These tragic deaths and injuries inflicted upon innocent persons would be a small price paid for the liberty of the people.
('73', 133, 1, 20, 267325) They may make an enquiry and the injured and the heirs to the deceased may receive compen sation.
('73', 133, 1, 21, 267423) But if I were a Mysorean, I would not lay stress on personal gains; I would use these sacrifices for gaining the liberty for which they had been made voluntarily or involuntarily.
('73', 133, 1, 22, 267603) They should also remember that one condition of success is the retention of a truly non violent spirit and atmosphere under every conceivable circumst ance.
('73', 133, 1, 23, 267760) I have been told that the people have been behaving with exemplary non violence and that the crowd bravely suffered the

('73', 134, 1, 2, 267930) firing.
('73', 134, 1, 3, 267938) If that is proved to be the case, I for one will rejoice over the loss of life.
('73', 134, 1, 4, 268018) It is the necessary price paid for gaining liberty.

('73', 134, 3, 6, 268088) 144. DISCUSSION WITH VALLABHBHAI PATEL 1
('73', 134, 4, 7, 268129) April 29, 1938 Sardar Vallabhbhai raised the question of the Lancashire Delegation coming out and asked Mahatmaji as to the lines on which the Congress is likely to approve of an agreement with U.K. Mahatmaji said that he could not see under what circumstances the Congress could be a party to agreeing to take cloth from Lancashire in return for cotton from India.
('73', 134, 4, 8, 268495) He said that would be definitely against the whole creed of the Congress.
('73', 134, 5, 9, 268569) Sardar Vallabhbhai pointed out that the Advisory Committee was appointed on a recommendation of the Assembly and the report of the Advisory Committee and the recommendation of the Government of India thereon were, without division, demanded by the Assembly to be put before them.
('73', 134, 5, 10, 268849) He, therefore, inferred that the Congress party in the Assembly were committed to negotiations with Lancashire, and he said that it would not be right for the Congress to go back on it.
('73', 134, 5, 11, 269035) Mahatmaji said that he was not a party to these requests and demands, but he said that as far as the Advisory Committee were concerned, he would say to them as under :
('73', 134, 6, 12, 269203) 1. The Advisory Committee may examine the trade pact from a purely economic point of view.
('73', 134, 6, 13, 269294) 2. That if, on that examination, they could honestly recommend an agreement with U.K., including an arrangement with Lancashire, he saw no objection to their making such recommendation.
('73', 134, 6, 14, 269480) 3. Per contra, if, on such examination, the Advisory Committee felt that they could not recommend such an agreement, he would not be sorry.
('73', 134, 6, 15, 269620) 4. That any such recommendation made by the Advisory Committee, as constituted, would command his best attention, but he would advise the Advisory Committee to put in a paragraph at the end of their recommendation saying that they had examined the whole question only from an economic point of view and no other.
('73', 134, 6, 16, 269933) Other points of view, viz., political, etc., were for the Government of India to consider and the Assembly to express an opinion on.
('73', 134, 6, 17, 270066) 5. Mahatmaji, however, made it clear in unambiguous language that if the Advisory Committee felt that they could not put in any such observation out of what he calls self respect, they may not do so.
('73', 134, 6, 18, 270266) He said that, in that case, the Congress was quite capable of raising its own points.
('73', 134, 6, 19, 270352) As I was leaving, he said:

('73', 135, 2, 3, 270562) He added that both these expressions of opinion from different points of view
('73', 135, 3, 4, 270640) would be equally valuable and consistent.

('73', 135, 7, 9, 270796) ON THE TRAIN TO PESHAWAR, April 30, 1938
('73', 135, 8, 10, 270837) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, Here, is a copy of the brief notes I have jotted down of the 31 2 hours talks with Jinnah.
('73', 135, 8, 11, 270948) It may be that you and the other members may not like the basis.
('73', 135, 8, 12, 271013) Personally I see no escape from it.
('73', 135, 8, 13, 271049) My handi cap today is that I do not move about the country, as you do, and a still more serious handicap is the inner despondency that has overtaken me.
('73', 135, 8, 14, 271202) I am carrying on, but it is galling to me to think that I have lost the self confidence that I possessed only a month ago.
('73', 135, 8, 15, 271325) I hope that this is but a temporary phase in my life.
('73', 135, 8, 16, 271379) I have mentioned this to help you to examine the proposals on their merits.
('73', 135, 8, 17, 271455) I do not suppose the first will present any difficulty.
('73', 135, 8, 18, 271511) The second is novel, with all its implications.
('73', 135, 8, 19, 271559) You will not hesitate summarily to reject it if it does not commend itself to you.
('73', 135, 8, 20, 271642) In this matter you will have to give the lead.
('73', 135, 8, 21, 271689) I expect to return on the 11th.
('73', 135, 8, 22, 271721) Subhas in reply to my telegram suggesting that he should open formal negotiations with Jinnah telegraphs that he will be in Bombay on the 10th.
('73', 135, 8, 23, 271865) I wish that you could also go there early.

('73', 136, 2, 3, 272185) [April, 1938] 1
('73', 136, 3, 4, 272201) I had a fairly long talk with Pyarelal last evening.
('73', 136, 3, 5, 272254) He has agreed to shoulder the responsibility for dealing with all the letters that you may entrust to him.
('73', 136, 3, 6, 272361) What I said was that Pyarelal and Kanu should open the letters, arrange them, pass on to you those that are for you alone to deal with and advise you as to the disposal of the rest.
('73', 136, 3, 7, 272543) He should not take upon himself the responsibility of tearing up the letters; he should just write on them may be torn up, may be kept, etc.
('73', 136, 3, 8, 272684) Only when something like this is done can your burden be made lighter, enabling you to work the way I want you to work.
('73', 136, 3, 9, 272804) I do not know to what extent you have been able to assimilate the idea of non violence.
('73', 136, 3, 10, 272892) I am anxious to know this because it is necessary.
('73', 136, 3, 11, 272943) That will be only when you have a variety of problems to tackle.
('73', 136, 3, 12, 273008) More and more occasions present themselves each day.
('73', 136, 3, 13, 273061) What can be done about the case of fanatical Muslims?
('73', 136, 3, 14, 273115) How can we cope with it?
('73', 136, 3, 15, 273140) I do not have a ready answer.
('73', 136, 3, 16, 273170) But it is a thing to which you should give thought.
('73', 136, 3, 17, 273222) In regard to N. W. F. P. your responsibility is of course great.

('73', 138, 5, 12, 275859) May 2, 1938
('73', 138, 6, 13, 275871) AMRITLAL, May you always remain a youth of eighteen or twenty two.
('73', 138, 6, 14, 275938) How could that be my condition?
('73', 138, 6, 15, 275970) You dont know passion, but I was a slave of passion for thirty years and tried to satisfy it.
('73', 138, 6, 16, 276064) Moreover, I recently discovered that I have not been able to subdue it at all.
('73', 138, 6, 17, 276143) I dont remember having had an emission while awake at any time during the last fifty years.
('73', 138, 6, 18, 276235) I am not referring here to the emission in dreams or those brought on by desire.
('73', 138, 6, 19, 276316) But I was in such a wretched and pitiable condition that in spite of my utmost efforts I could not stop the discharge though I was fully awake.
('73', 138, 6, 20, 276460) 1 I feel now that the despondency that I had been feeling deep down in me only foresh adowed this occurrence.
('73', 138, 6, 21, 276570) After the event, restlessness has become acute beyond words.
('73', 138, 6, 22, 276631) Where am I, where is my place, and how can a person subject to passion represent non violence and truth?
('73', 138, 6, 23, 276736) This turmoil goes on in my heart.
('73', 138, 6, 24, 276770) I keep asking myself:am I worthy of you all who follow me, am I fit to lead you all?
('73', 138, 6, 25, 276855) God will answer the question when He pleases.
('73', 138, 6, 26, 276901) Is it not said that Rama is the strength of the weak?
('73', 138, 6, 27, 276955) There must be some place where you can settle down.
('73', 138, 6, 28, 277007) We will think over the matter when I return.
('73', 138, 6, 29, 277052) Think over what you would like to suggest.

('73', 139, 7, 13, 277659) The Jains who visit the common temples follow Hinduism.

('73', 139, 7, 15, 277770) A temple goer should certainly keep away from any temple which the untouchables cannot enter, shouldnt he?
('73', 139, 7, 16, 277877) Are you studying anything there?

('73', 140, 7, 14, 278990) The problem however is not so simple as you have put it.
('73', 140, 7, 15, 279047) If complete brahma charya under the conditions I am trying is like an attempt to climb the craters in the moon.

('73', 140, 7, 17, 279231) 2 You are quite right in describing my experiment as new.
('73', 140, 7, 18, 279289) So is my experiment in ahimsa.
('73', 140, 7, 19, 279320) The two hang together.
('73', 140, 7, 20, 279343) Remember that my experiment has natural limitations.
('73', 140, 7, 21, 279396) I may neither tempt God nor the Devil.
('73', 140, 7, 22, 279435) I have not the time to prolong the argument.
('73', 140, 7, 23, 279480) In your next letter you must tell me in concrete terms what definite changes I should make so as to fit in with your idea.
('73', 140, 7, 24, 279603) Should I deny myself the service rendered by Sushila?
('73', 140, 7, 25, 279657) Should I refuse to have malish 3 by Lilavati or Amtul Salaam for instance?
('73', 140, 7, 26, 279732) Or do you want to say that I should never lean on girls shoulders?
('73', 140, 7, 27, 279799) Need less to say you wont pain me at all by telling me frankly whatever you think I should do to get out of the terrible despond ency.
('73', 140, 7, 28, 279934) Just now I am most in need of support from those who surround me with service and affection, undeserved as it seems to me, for the time being.
('73', 140, 7, 29, 280077) In guiding me remember that what I am doing I have done all my life you may say.

('73', 141, 1, 5, 280534) That degrading, dirty, torturing expe rience of 14th April shook me to bits and made me feel as if I was hurled by God from an imaginary paradise where I had no right to be in my uncleanliness.

('73', 141, 5, 12, 281156) Whenever there is an opportunity you should ask orally as it is easier for me to give oral answers.
('73', 141, 5, 13, 281256) It saves time.
('73', 141, 5, 14, 281271) Your interpreting it as natural is correct.
('73', 141, 5, 15, 281315) All vikaras 1 need not be rejected.
('73', 141, 5, 16, 281351) Even pitying a man is a vikara.
('73', 141, 5, 17, 281383) Our distaste for something bad is also a vikara but not to be rejected.
('73', 141, 5, 18, 281455) If it is desirable to carry on the business of the world, then the vikara needed for this is not only in order but is necessary.
('73', 141, 5, 19, 281584) Of course vital fluid is discharged also when man and wife come together to procreate; but then it does not go waste.
('73', 141, 5, 20, 281702) It may be a fall.
('73', 141, 5, 21, 281720) The fall leads to new creation as a rise often does.
('73', 141, 5, 22, 281773) It cannot be said that procreation is always harmful.
('73', 141, 5, 23, 281827) Saying this would amount to finding fault with God.
('73', 141, 5, 24, 281879) Those couples who come together only for the sake of a felt need for offspring and otherwise remain like brother and sistercan remain so without any vikara deserve a million salutations; they are perfect brahmacharis.

('73', 142, 3, 11, 282913) There is no doubt that the work belongs essentially to you of the younger generation.
('73', 142, 3, 12, 282999) We are now getting old and will soon be gathered to our fathers.
('73', 142, 3, 13, 283064) You have therefore to shoulder the burden.
('73', 142, 3, 14, 283107) How you can help in achieving the great object, you have yourselves shown in your address by your appreciative preference to non violence and to Khan Sahebs work.
('73', 142, 3, 15, 283270) I do not know if your reference was deliberate and if you knew the full implication of what you were saying.
('73', 142, 3, 16, 283379) I do hope you knew what you were saying and that you fully weighed your words.
('73', 142, 3, 17, 283458) If you have, then I should like to take you a step further.
('73', 142, 3, 18, 283518) After explaining the circumstances which had delayed his visiting the Frontier, Mahatma Gandhi said that when it was first known that he was to visit the Frontier people said that this man (Mahatma Gandhi) was going to make the people cowards.
('73', 142, 3, 19, 283762) If non violence means that, you should despise it.
('73', 142, 4, 20, 283813) An Urdu newspaper has said that my mission in the Frontier Province is the emasculation of the Pathans, Whereas Khan Saheb has invited me here in order that the Pathans might hear the message of non violence from my own lips and in order that I might see the Khudai Khidmatgars at close quarters and find out to what extent

('73', 143, 1, 2, 284425) non violence has permeated them.
('73', 143, 1, 3, 284458) 1 That means that the Khan Saheb at any rate has no such fear as has been expressed by that Urdu paper.
('73', 143, 1, 4, 284562) For he knows that true non violence is mightier than the mightiest violence.
('73', 143, 1, 5, 284639) If therefore you really know the essential nature of non violence and appreciate Khan Sahebs work, you will have to pledge yourselves to non violence, and that in spite of the fact that violence is so much in the air and we are talking day in and day out of military manoeuvres and aerial action, armaments and naval strength.
('73', 143, 1, 6, 284966) You have to realize that the power of unarmed non violence is any day far superior to that of armed force.
('73', 143, 1, 7, 285073) With me acceptance of non violence was instinctive, it was part of my training and home influence in childhood.
('73', 143, 1, 8, 285185) I have been preaching the creed of non violence for 50 years.
('73', 143, 1, 9, 285247) 2 Its superior strength I came to realize in South Africa where I had to pit it against organized violence and racial prejudice.
('73', 143, 1, 10, 285376) I practised it in South Africa, where everybody, like the Pathans, is armed and the Government has introduced conscription.
('73', 143, 1, 11, 285500) 3 The people said how a handful of Indians could fight the African Government with that weapon.
('73', 143, 1, 12, 285596) I returned from South Africa with a clear conviction of the superiority of the method of non violence to that of violence.
('73', 143, 1, 13, 285719) In India also, we have used it for gaining our rights and we have achieved some measure of success.
('73', 143, 2, 14, 285819) If the method of violence takes plenty of training, the method of non violence takes even more training, and that training is much more difficult than the training for violence.
('73', 143, 2, 15, 285997) The first essential of that training is a living faith in God.
('73', 143, 2, 16, 286060) He who has a living faith in God will not do evil deeds with the name of God on his lips.
('73', 143, 2, 17, 286150) He will not rely on the sword but will rely solely on God.
('73', 143, 2, 18, 286209) Lakhs of Muslims commit sins in the name of God and lakhs of Hindus who say Rama do likewise.
('73', 143, 2, 19, 286303) 5 A genuine believer in God need not have a stick in his hand.
('73', 143, 2, 20, 286366) One who repeats Gods name and recites the kalmah may not be Allahs devotee.
('73', 143, 2, 21, 286442) He alone is a man of God who sees God in every soul.
('73', 143, 2, 22, 286495) Such a man would not be prepared to kill another.
('73', 143, 2, 23, 286545) But you may say that a coward may also pass off as a believer in God saying he

('73', 143, 3, 25, 286683) There are other small things, but they could not have brought me here.
('73', 143, 3, 26, 286754) If you really understand non violence, you will have to be non violent throughout. 2 This sentence is from The Hindustan Times.

('73', 144, 1, 2, 287111) does not use the sword.
('73', 144, 1, 3, 287135) Cowardice is no sign of belief in God.
('73', 144, 1, 4, 287174) The true man of God has the strength to use the sword, but will not use it knowing that every man is the image of God.
('73', 144, 1, 5, 287293) Islam, it is said, believes in the brotherhood of man.
('73', 144, 1, 6, 287348) But you will permit me to point out that it is not the brotherhood of Mussalmans only but it is universal brotherhood, and that brings me to the second essential of the training for non violence.
('73', 144, 1, 7, 287544) We must not believe in non violence as a policy, but as an article of faith.
('73', 144, 1, 8, 287621) 1 The Allah of Islam is the same as the God of Christians and the Ishwara of Hindus.
('73', 144, 1, 9, 287706) Even as there are numerous names of God in Hinduism there are as many names of God in Islam.
('73', 144, 1, 10, 287799) The names do not indicate individuality but attributes, and little man has tried in his humble way to describe the mighty God by giving Him attributes, though He is above all attributes, Indescribable, inconceivable, Immeasurable.
('73', 144, 1, 11, 288030) Living faith in this God means acceptance of the brotherhood of mankind.
('73', 144, 1, 12, 288103) It also means equal respect for all religions.
('73', 144, 1, 13, 288150) If Islam is dear to you, Hindusim is dear to me and Christianity is dear to the Christians.
('73', 144, 1, 14, 288242) It would be the height of intoleranceand intolerance is a species of violenceto believe that your religion is superior to other religions and that you would be justified in wanting others to change over to your faith.
('73', 144, 1, 15, 288460) The third essential is the acceptance of truth and purity, for one claiming to have an active faith in God cannot but be pure and truth ful.
('73', 144, 1, 16, 288601) Now let me tell you that your appreciation of Khan Sahebs services and of non violence carries all these implications if the appreciation is genuine.
('73', 144, 1, 17, 288751) If you want to preach non violence in India and the world at large, you must accept my advice in the matter based on long ex perience.
('73', 144, 1, 18, 288886) If you forsake non violence, you will have to forsake Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
('73', 144, 1, 19, 288965) He cannot go a step without your assistance.
('73', 144, 1, 20, 289010) God also helps through people by moving their hearts.
('73', 144, 1, 21, 289064) I have travelled throughout the world and seen that people do not realize and appreciate the full implications of the non violence creed.
('73', 144, 1, 22, 289202) We have to defend Indias wealth with non violence.
('73', 144, 1, 23, 289253) Millions of our people will have to fully realize the implications of this creed.
('73', 144, 1, 24, 289335) Non violence is meant for all irrespective of faith.

('73', 145, 1, 4, 289748) Those who claim to lead have to live up to all the implications and express them in their daily life.

('73', 145, 1, 8, 290097) It will be stronger than of one with the sword.

('73', 145, 5, 14, 290450) Mahatma Gandhi replied that the Socialists believing in the Congress creed
('73', 145, 6, 15, 290525) could not be excluded from the Congress on account of their socialistic ideas.
('73', 145, 7, 16, 290604) Gandhiji is reported to have pointed out that Pandit Nehru and Mr. Subhas Chandra
('73', 145, 8, 17, 290686) Bose were Socialists.
('73', 145, 8, 18, 290708) So long as the Socialists accepted the Congress creed and
('73', 145, 9, 19, 290766) carried out the Congress programme he could not see there was any objection to their
('73', 145, 10, 20, 290851) being admitted into the Congress organization.
('73', 145, 10, 21, 290898) This, however, was his interpretation
('73', 145, 11, 22, 290936) of the existing Congress practice.
('73', 145, 11, 23, 290971) Whether different courses were warranted under
('73', 145, 12, 24, 291018) particular local conditions in the Frontier Province, he was unable to say.

('73', 146, 2, 3, 291570) May 5, 1938
('73', 146, 3, 4, 291582) Replying to the address in Hindustani, Mahama Gandhi said that his heart rebelled against speaking in English for the sake of a few Englishmen in the audi ence.
('73', 146, 3, 5, 291743) He took strong exception to addresses being presented in English when he could well read Urdu and, if he felt any difficulty anywhere, he could consult Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan.
('73', 146, 3, 6, 291920) Continuing, Gandhiji said: 2
('73', 146, 4, 7, 291949) Your address is one paean of praise of me.
('73', 146, 4, 8, 291992) Well, I have never found it easy to appropriate such praise, but let me tell you that there was no time in my life when I was less able to appropriate such praise than I am today.
('73', 146, 4, 9, 292172) For a curious sense of despondency has possessed me and I cannot yet get over it.
('73', 146, 4, 10, 292254) Well, I came here not to make a speech, and I was told that I need not give more than five minutes.
('73', 146, 4, 11, 292354) But a sentence in your address 3 compels me to devote a few minutes more than I had anticipated.
('73', 146, 4, 12, 292451) The sentence about non violent passive resistance at once took my memory back to Germiston in South Africa in 1907 4. A meeting of European friends was convened to hear me speak on passive resistance, as the movement was then known.
('73', 146, 4, 13, 292684) The Chairman of the meeting there expressed practically the same statement as you have made in the address, viz., that passive resistance was a weapon of the weak.
('73', 146, 4, 14, 292848) The reference jarred on me and I immediately corrected the speaker.
('73', 146, 4, 15, 292916) It is curious, if not also surprising, that you should have made the same mistake after all these years of satyagraha in India.
('73', 146, 4, 16, 293044) We may be weak and oppressed, but non violence in not a weapon of the weak.
('73', 146, 4, 17, 293120) 5 It is a wea pon of strongest and the bravest.
('73', 146, 4, 18, 293168) Non violence has greaterpower than Hitlers or Mussolinis force.

('73', 147, 1, 2, 294003) the weak and the oppressed.
('73', 147, 1, 3, 294031) Being strangers to non violence nothing else is open to them.
('73', 147, 1, 4, 294093) It is, however, true that passive resistance has been regarded as a weapon of the weak.
('73', 147, 1, 5, 294181) That was why the name satyagraha was coined in South Africa to distinguish the movement there from passive resistance.
('73', 147, 1, 6, 294300) Passive resistance is a negative thing, and has nothing to do with the active principle of Love.
('73', 147, 1, 7, 294397) Satyagraha proceeds on the active principle of Love which says, Love those that despitefully use you.
('73', 147, 1, 8, 294499) It is easy for you to love your friends.
('73', 147, 1, 9, 294540) But I say unto you, love your enemies. 1 If satyagraha was a weapon of the weak, I should be deceiving Khan Saheb, for no Pathan has yet confessed his weakness.
('73', 147, 1, 10, 294701) It was Khan Saheb who told me that he never felt so strong and brave as when he, out of a free will, renounced the lathi and the rifle.
('73', 147, 1, 11, 294837) If it was not the Supreme weapon of the brave, I should certainly have hesitated to place it before a brave community like the Pathans.
('73', 147, 1, 12, 294973) It is with that weapon that Khan Saheb can bid fair to befriend and convert the brave Afridis and the other tribesmen.
('73', 147, 1, 13, 295092) You know the Afridi does not fear death.
('73', 147, 1, 14, 295133) 2 I have to make him braver, not a weakling.
('73', 147, 1, 15, 295178) Otherwise Khan Saheb will despise me.
('73', 147, 1, 16, 295216) I am glad to have had this opportunity of correcting you.
('73', 147, 1, 17, 295274) For the moment you realize it, you will enlist yourself as workers in the cause for which Khan Saheb and I are working.
('73', 147, 1, 18, 295394) That it is difficult to carry conviction I agree.
('73', 147, 1, 19, 295444) I find it difficult in spite of my conscious practice of it for the last 50 years.
('73', 147, 1, 20, 295527) But it presupposes purity of the highest type.
('73', 147, 1, 21, 295574) Infinite patience is requiredeven the patience of emptying the ocean with a blade of grass.
('73', 147, 1, 22, 295666) If we want complete independence for India, it can be through non violence alone.

('73', 148, 1, 2, 296308) Khidmatgars live, move and work.
('73', 148, 1, 3, 296341) The Khan Saheb was also keen that I must see all these and testify to what extent they had assimilated non violence.
('73', 148, 1, 4, 296458) That examination I am afraid cannot be carried on during this brief tour.
('73', 148, 1, 5, 296532) But let me tell you that my desire to live in your midst has increased.
('73', 148, 1, 6, 296604) To night I am thankful that I have been able even to come to Utmanzai and Charsadda and to see you all.
('73', 148, 1, 7, 296708) Khan Saheb and Dr. Khan Saheb I had seen much of even in Wardha, but I wanted to see you and make your acquaintance.
('73', 148, 1, 8, 296825) A great responsibility rests on your and Khan Sahebs shoulders.
('73', 148, 1, 9, 296889) You have deliberately chosen a name that carries mighty implications.
('73', 148, 1, 10, 296959) You might have called yourselves Servants of the people, or of the Pathans, or of Islam; but you chose instead the name Khudai KhidmatgarsServants of God, i.e., Servants of humanity which includes, Hindus, Mussalmans, Chris tians [of the] Punjab, Gujarat and other parts of India, and also other parts of the world.
('73', 148, 1, 11, 297275) This very ambitious title implies the acceptance of non violence.
('73', 148, 1, 12, 297341) How can a man in the name of God serve humanity by means of the sword?
('73', 148, 1, 13, 297412) It can be only done by means of a force that God has given us and which is superior to any other force that we can think of.
('73', 148, 1, 14, 297537) If you do not understand this, you may be sure that the world will laugh at the Khan Saheb and me as vain hypocrites.
('73', 148, 1, 15, 297655) Whilst therefore I am delighted at the sight of the Khudai Khidmatgars, I am also seized with a kind of fright.
('73', 148, 1, 16, 297767) Many people have warned me against you, but that warning does not matter if you are true to your creed.
('73', 148, 1, 17, 297871) Remember that you outnumber volunteers in the whole of India, and that you are more disciplined than volunteers in other parts of India.
('73', 148, 1, 18, 298008) But unless the discipline is rooted in non violence the discipline might prove a source of infinite mischief.
('73', 148, 1, 19, 298118) I have rarely in my tours seen more orderly and quieter meetings.
('73', 148, 1, 20, 298184) I congratulate you and expressmy gratefulness for all the affection you have showered on me.
('73', 148, 1, 21, 298277) I shall conclude with the prayer that the Frontier Pathans may make not only India free, but teach the world, through an India made non violently free, the priceless lesson of non violence.

('73', 149, 2, 3, 298653) MARDAN, May 7, 1938
('73', 149, 3, 4, 298673) MY DEAR IDIOT, Sushila has been keeping you informed about me.
('73', 149, 3, 5, 298736) I have not therefore worried to write to you.
('73', 149, 3, 6, 298782) It has been an anxious time here.
('73', 149, 3, 7, 298816) Your analysis is good.
('73', 149, 3, 8, 298839) Of course the experience was due to my weakness, lack of faith.
('73', 149, 4, 9, 298903) Let us all hope that I shall come out of the well of despair stronger and purer.
('73', 149, 4, 10, 298984) There is as yet no sign of the end of the crisis.
('73', 149, 4, 11, 299034) Darkness is still there.
('73', 149, 4, 12, 299059) There is still an unaccountable dissatisfaction with myself.
('73', 149, 4, 13, 299120) Moodiness is wholly unnatural to me.
('73', 149, 4, 14, 299157) it creeps over me now and again.
('73', 149, 4, 15, 299190) I suppress it by constant work.
('73', 149, 4, 16, 299222) But the body does not respond to it as readily as I want it to.
('73', 149, 4, 17, 299286) But I have not lost faith.
('73', 149, 4, 18, 299313) There are signs that I shall get out of the slough.
('73', 149, 4, 19, 299365) I may be deceived.
('73', 149, 4, 20, 299384) I have patience.
('73', 149, 4, 21, 299401) I do not fret over the delay.
('73', 149, 4, 22, 299431) If it is to be a new birth, a regeneration all round, it must be preceded by adequate travail.
('73', 149, 4, 23, 299526) You are not to worry over my present condition.
('73', 149, 4, 24, 299574) The sexual sense is the hardest to over come in my case.
('73', 149, 4, 25, 299631) It has been an incessant struggle.
('73', 149, 4, 26, 299666) It is for me a miracle how I have survived it.
('73', 149, 4, 27, 299713) The one I am engaged in may be, ought to be, the final struggle.

('73', 149, 9, 32, 299888) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, What is it in the new orientation of the Gandhi Seva Sangh that has disturbed you?
('73', 149, 9, 33, 299991) I must own that I am responsible for it.
('73', 149, 9, 34, 300032) I should like you to tell me unhesitatingly what has disturbed you.
('73', 149, 9, 35, 300100) If I have erred, you know that I shall retrace my steps as soon as I discover the error.

('73', 150, 5, 6, 300500) MARDAN, May 7, 1938
('73', 150, 6, 7, 300520) AMRITLAL, You must have got my reply.
('73', 150, 6, 8, 300558) I think it would be best to use Gokuldass 1 money for purchasing books.
('73', 150, 6, 9, 300630) I hope Chakraiyya will not lose the weight which he has gained.
('73', 150, 6, 10, 300694) It is sad that Vijaya is not improving.
('73', 150, 6, 11, 300734) If she has not come there, write to her to come and see me in Bombay.
('73', 150, 6, 12, 300804) I am also writing to her.
('73', 150, 6, 13, 300830) Please inquire about the letter which got lost.
('73', 150, 7, 14, 300878) Blessings from

('73', 150, 11, 17, 300962) May 7, 1938 3
('73', 150, 12, 18, 300976) If what you have told me is a solemn promise, and if you can keep it, you may be sure that we will win not only the freedom of India but something more.
('73', 150, 12, 19, 301129) When we can be ready to sacrifice any number of men in the cause of non violence, we can easily bid fair to be spared the ghastly spectre of war that is now threatening Europe.
('73', 150, 12, 20, 301306) We talk of doing everything in the name of God.
('73', 150, 12, 21, 301354) We call ourselves Khudai Khidmatgars, we profess to have given up the sword, and yet if we have not put the sword and the dagger out of our hearts, we are sure to be disgraced and the name Khudai Khidmatgar will be a term of reproach.

('73', 151, 1, 2, 301743) I have not yet recovered from the shock of the story 1 I heard this afternoon.
('73', 151, 1, 3, 301822) The Sikhs from Mayar told me of the tragedy that happened there in broad daylight.
('73', 151, 1, 4, 301905) So far as I know the victims had done nothing to provoke the ire of the assassins.
('73', 151, 1, 5, 301988) The assassins did the deed in broad daylight and bolted away without anyone trying to apprehend them.
('73', 151, 1, 6, 302090) It is worth pondering over how such a thing could happen when we are all talking of non violence.
('73', 151, 1, 7, 302188) There were in the village Khudai Khidmatgars and others believing in the creed of non violence.
('73', 151, 1, 8, 302284) It was their duty to catch the culprits.
('73', 151, 1, 9, 302325) It is their duty to prevent the recurrence of the deed.
('73', 151, 1, 10, 302381) It is also your duty to befriend the bereaved and to assure the fear stricken of your sympathy and succour.
('73', 151, 1, 11, 302489) So long as things of this kind countinue to happen in our midst, our non violence must be in doubt.

('73', 151, 4, 14, 302633) May 7, 1938 3
('73', 151, 5, 15, 302647) Your address is made up of two partsone devoted to my praise and the other to non violence.
('73', 151, 5, 16, 302739) The first part may be ignored for I am sure that that is going to do good to nobody.
('73', 151, 5, 17, 302824) In fact I am quite sure that if someone offered to sing my praises for twenty four hours, he would get tired and I should fall fast asleep.
('73', 151, 5, 18, 302964) What God may have enabled me to do is but a repayment of debt, and he who repays a debt deserves no praise.
('73', 151, 5, 19, 303072) In fact if he fails to do so, he may be liable to prosecution.
('73', 151, 5, 20, 303135) What interests me more is what you have said about non violence.
('73', 151, 5, 21, 303200) Let me tell you that I should not have been able to sum up better the characteristics of a non violent man.
('73', 151, 5, 22, 303308) But let me tell you what you have not said in your address, and that is the implications of non violence.
('73', 151, 5, 23, 303414) You must have heard of the riots 3 I n Allahabad and
('73', 151, 6, 24, 303467) 1 At Mayar, a village about three kilometres from Mardan, three Sikhsa boy of 11, an old man of 80 and a young man of 25were murdered by three Pathans.

('73', 152, 1, 3, 303748) These would be impossible if there was really non violence amongst us.
('73', 152, 1, 4, 303819) There are thousands of members on the Congress register.
('73', 152, 1, 5, 303876) If they were really non violent, these riots would not have occurred.
('73', 152, 1, 6, 303946) But we not only failed to prevent them, but even sought the aid of the military and the police to quell them.
('73', 152, 1, 7, 304056) Some of our Con gressmen argued with me that our non violence was limited to our dealings with the Englishmen.
('73', 152, 1, 8, 304167) Then I say that non violence was not the weapon of the strong, but of the weak.
('73', 152, 1, 9, 304247) Active non violence of the brave puts to flight thieves, dacoits, murderers, and prepares an army of volunteers ready to sacrifice themselves in quelling riots, in extin guishing fires and feuds, and so on.
('73', 152, 1, 10, 304454) you have said that non violence automatically solves unemployment.
('73', 152, 1, 11, 304521) You are right, for it rules out exploitation.
('73', 152, 1, 12, 304567) The non violent man automatically becomes a servant of God.
('73', 152, 1, 13, 304627) He should be ready to render account to God of every minute of his time.
('73', 152, 1, 14, 304700) May you all be true servants of God and true practisers of non violence.

('73', 152, 4, 18, 304908) My search still continues.
('73', 152, 4, 19, 304935) It gives me joy.
('73', 152, 4, 20, 304952) I rejoice in the pain that sometimes accompanies the labour.
('73', 152, 4, 21, 305013) God who has never for saken me is not going to do so now.
('73', 152, 4, 22, 305071) I am therefore indifferent what comes out of the search.
('73', 152, 4, 23, 305128) But you must continue to warn me so long as you think that I go astray in action.
('73', 152, 4, 24, 305210) Your brother in laws letter is very fine.
('73', 152, 4, 25, 305252) Evidently your sister was a very superior womana rare type.
('73', 152, 4, 26, 305312) I can understand your grief over such a loss.
('73', 152, 4, 27, 305358) But such losses are a test of our faith.
('73', 152, 4, 28, 305399) Nothing but a fixed faith that death for the good is a translation to a better state, and for the evil a beneficent escape, can reconcile us to the mystery of death.

('73', 153, 1, 2, 305731) 167. SPEECH AT POLITICAL CONFERENCE, PESHAWAR 1
('73', 153, 2, 3, 305779) May 8, 1938 In all your three addresses 2 you have told me that you made a triumphant and unique demonstration of non violence during the C. D. campaign, but I have to find out whether you have assimilated non violence with all its implications.
('73', 153, 2, 4, 306025) The principal purpose of my visit was to find out whether all that I had heard from the Khan Saheb about the Khudai Khidmatgars was true, and I am very sorry that I could not give all the time that was needed in order to find out the truth.
('73', 153, 2, 5, 306266) One conviction I am carrying back with me, viz., the wonderful and affectionate allegiance of the people to the Khan Saheb as their general.
('73', 153, 2, 6, 306407) Not only the Khudai Khidmatgars but I noticed wherever I went that every man, woman and child knew him and loved him.
('73', 153, 2, 7, 306525) They greeted him most familiarly.
('73', 153, 2, 8, 306559) His touch seemed to soothe them.
('73', 153, 2, 9, 306592) And Khan Saheb was most gentle to whoever approached him.
('73', 153, 2, 10, 306650) The obedience of the Khudai Khidmatgars was unquestioned.
('73', 153, 2, 11, 306708) All this has filled me with boundless joy.
('73', 153, 2, 12, 306751) A general merits such obedience.
('73', 153, 2, 13, 306784) Khan Saheb has it by right of love unlike the ordinary general who exacts obedience through fear.
('73', 153, 2, 14, 306882) The question now is what use will Khan Saheb make of the tremen dous power of which he finds himself in possession?
('73', 153, 2, 15, 306998) I cannot answer the question now.
('73', 153, 2, 16, 307032) Nor can the Khan Saheb.
('73', 153, 2, 17, 307056) Hence it is that, if God wills it, I should like to revisit this wonderful Province about October, make a prolonged stay and study in detail the working of non violence.

('73', 153, 6, 21, 307310) A professor of Islamia College came with a question that was troubling him and is troubling many of the present generationbelief in God.
('73', 153, 6, 22, 307447) What was the basis

('73', 153, 7, 24, 307517) 2 Presented by Municipal and District Boards of Peshawar 3 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Frontier Notes III 4 Gandhiji left Peshawar in the morning on May 9.

('73', 154, 1, 2, 307725) of his belief if Gandhiji had it, as he knew he had it?
('73', 154, 1, 3, 307781) What was his experience?
('73', 154, 1, 4, 307806) [GANDHIJI:] It can never be a matter for argument.
('73', 154, 1, 5, 307857) If you would have me convince others by argument I am floored.
('73', 154, 1, 6, 307920) But I can tell you this that I am surer of His existence than of the fact that you and I are sitting in this room.
('73', 154, 1, 7, 308035) Then I can also testify that I may live without air and water but not without Him.
('73', 154, 1, 8, 308118) You may pluck out my eyes, but that cannot kill me.
('73', 154, 1, 9, 308170) You may chop off my nose, but that will not kill me.
('73', 154, 1, 10, 308223) But blast my belief in God and I am dead.
('73', 154, 1, 11, 308265) You may call this a superstition, but I confess it is a superstition that I hug, even as I used to hug the name of Rama in my childhood when there was any cause of danger or alarm.
('73', 154, 1, 12, 308446) That was what an old nurse had taught me.
('73', 154, 2, 13, 308488) But you think that superstition was necessary for you?
('73', 154, 2, 14, 308543) Yes, necessary to sustain me.
('73', 154, 3, 15, 308573) That is all right.
('73', 154, 3, 16, 308592) May I now ask if you had anything like a prophetic vision?
('73', 154, 3, 17, 308651) I do not know what you call a vision and what you will call prophetic.
('73', 154, 3, 18, 308722) But let me give you an experience in my life.
('73', 154, 3, 19, 308768) When I announced 2 my fast of 21 days in jail I had not reasoned about it.
('73', 154, 3, 20, 308843) On retiring to bed the previous night I had no notion that I was going to announce the next morning a fast of 21 days.
('73', 154, 3, 21, 308962) But in the middle of the night a Voice woke me up and said: Go through a fast. How many? I asked.
('73', 154, 3, 22, 309060) 21 days, was the answer.
('73', 154, 3, 23, 309085) Now let me tell you that my mind was unprepared for it, disinclined for it.
('73', 154, 3, 24, 309161) But the thing came to me as clearly as anything could be.
('73', 154, 3, 25, 309219) Let me tell you one thing more and I have done.
('73', 154, 3, 26, 309267) Whatever striking things I have done in life I have not done prompted by reason but prompted by the instinct, I would say God.
('73', 154, 3, 27, 309394) Take the Dandi Salt March of 1930. I had not the ghost of a suspicion how the breach of Salt Law would work itself out.
('73', 154, 3, 28, 309514) Pandit Motilalji and other friends were fretting and did not know what I would do; and I could tell them nothing, as I myself knew nothing about it.
('73', 154, 3, 29, 309663) But like a flash it came, and as you know it was enough to shake the country from one end to the other.
('73', 154, 3, 30, 309767) One last thing.
('73', 154, 3, 31, 309783) Until the last day I knew nothing about announcing the 6th of April 1919 as a day of fasting and prayer.
('73', 154, 3, 32, 309888) But I dreamt about itthere was no Voice or Vision as in 1930and I felt it was just the thing to do.
('73', 154, 3, 33, 309988) In the morning I shared it with C.R. and announced it to the country, you know with what a wonderfully spontaneous response.

('73', 155, 2, 3, 310363) PESHAWAR, [Before May 9, 1938] 2
('73', 155, 3, 4, 310396) [PROFESSOR:] How is it that many of the English Pacifists are talking of defence and elaborate plans of defence?.
('73', 155, 3, 5, 310510) May it not be possible to carry pacifism too far?
('73', 155, 3, 6, 310560) Supposing Abyssinia had simply non resisted and said to Italy, Do your worst, would the Italians have been ashamed and desisted from their design?
('73', 155, 3, 7, 310707) Lansbury said they would.
('73', 155, 3, 8, 310733) [GANDHIJI:] I shall take up the Abyssinian question first.
('73', 155, 3, 9, 310792) I can answer it only in terms of active resistant non violence.
('73', 155, 3, 10, 310856) Now non violence is the activest force on earth, and it is my conviction that it never fails.
('73', 155, 3, 11, 310950) But if the Abyssinians had adopted the attitude of non violence of the strong, i.e, the non violence which breaks to pieces but never bends, Mussolini would have had no interest in Abyssinia.
('73', 155, 3, 12, 311142) Thus if they had simply said: You are welcome to reduce us to dust or ashes but you will not find one Abyssinian ready to co operate with you, what would Mussolini have done?
('73', 155, 3, 13, 311317) He did not want a desert.
('73', 155, 3, 14, 311343) Mussolini wanted submission and not defiance, and if he had met with the quiet, dignified and non violent defiance that I have described, he would certainly have been obliged to retire.
('73', 155, 3, 15, 311529) Of course it is open to anyone to say that human nature has not been known to rise to such heights.
('73', 155, 3, 16, 311629) But if we have made unexpected progress in physical sciences, why may we do less in the science of the soul?
('73', 155, 3, 17, 311738) Now about the English Pacifists.
('73', 155, 3, 18, 311771) I know there are some great and sincere men amongst them, but they are thinking in terms of pacifism as distinguished from unadulterated non violence.
('73', 155, 3, 19, 311922) I am essentially a non violent man, and I believe in war bereft of every trace of violence.
('73', 155, 3, 20, 312014) An essentially non violent man does not calculate the consequences.
('73', 155, 3, 21, 312082) The English Pacifists you are talking of calculate, and when they speak of pacifism they do so with the mental reservation that when pacifism fails, arms might be used.
('73', 155, 3, 22, 312251) With them not non violence but arms are the ultimate sanction, as was the case with Woodrow Wilsons Fourteen Points 3. No, someone has to arise in

('73', 157, 7, 12, 314542) SUSHILA, I had been awaiting your letter.
('73', 157, 7, 13, 314584) I had it yesterday.
('73', 157, 7, 14, 314604) I found nothing in it that would do any harm if Mahadev read it.
('73', 157, 7, 15, 314669) Mahadev read all the letters.
('73', 157, 7, 16, 314699) What was there in it to add fuel to the fire?
('73', 157, 7, 17, 314745) Stupid girl!
('73', 157, 7, 18, 314758) You are indeed stupid.
('73', 157, 7, 19, 314781) For that reason I love you all the more.
('73', 157, 7, 20, 314822) Your obstinacy does not hurt me.
('73', 157, 7, 21, 314855) I will not let you remain stupid forever.
('73', 157, 7, 22, 314897) You are not a goddess, nor is Mahadev a god.
('73', 157, 7, 23, 314942) The future is bright if this illusion has been dispelled.
('73', 157, 7, 24, 315000) I consider both of you simple hearted.
('73', 157, 7, 25, 315039) The only difference is that you have not expe rienced lust.
('73', 157, 7, 26, 315099) Mahadev has done so in full measure.
('73', 157, 7, 27, 315136) He is a married man after all.
('73', 157, 7, 28, 315167) But the god of love is subtle.
('73', 157, 7, 29, 315198) You were both unaware of his attack.
('73', 157, 7, 30, 315235) You needlessly blame yourself.
('73', 157, 7, 31, 315266) Desire had certainly taken possession of you.
('73', 157, 7, 32, 315312) But you were not aware of it at all.
('73', 157, 7, 33, 315349) For that matter even Mahadev was not aware of it.
('73', 157, 7, 34, 315399) Mahadev was not careful.
('73', 157, 7, 35, 315424) But he was not aware even of that.
('73', 157, 7, 36, 315459) Neither you nor Mahadev has given me any unhappiness.
('73', 157, 7, 37, 315513) So long as your reason does not accept something, you must never accept it, however much it may hurt me or anybody else.
('73', 157, 7, 38, 315634) My advice is that you should now forget the past, and remaining cheerful by doing your present duty, free my mind from anxiety.
('73', 157, 7, 39, 315762) Let me know your programme.
('73', 157, 7, 40, 315790) Dr. Gilder was here.

('73', 158, 6, 13, 316429) NEW DELHI, May 10, 1938
('73', 158, 7, 14, 316453) The Associated Press sought the opinion of Mahatma Gandhi regarding the terms of the settlement arrived at between the Mysore Government and the Mysore Congress over the flag trouble, 1 announced by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, when he arrived here this morning by the Frontier Mail on his way to Bombay.
('73', 158, 8, 15, 316755) Mahatma Gandhi said that he fully concurred with the terms of the settlement as he thought that it was the proper decision in the circumstances.
('73', 158, 8, 16, 316900) When he was told that some Socialists objected to Sardar Patels decision to allow the State flag to be hoisted by the side of the Congess flag, Mahatma Gandhi said that their objection was nevertheless not without reason; because they wanted to abolish the States, which was only possible by armed revolution to which creed he did not subscribe.
('73', 158, 9, 17, 317246) When questioned as to what should be the attitude of the general public towards the Congress flag and the Red (Socialist) flag in the case of the Congress sponsoring the labour cause in a strike, Gandhiji thought that with him the only flag that counted was the Congress flag.
('73', 158, 9, 18, 317523) A labour union which had faith in the Congress should, in all circumstances, work under the Congress flag.
('73', 158, 9, 19, 317630) If there were many flags, he feared that a clash was bound to occur.
('73', 158, 10, 20, 317699) 1 The terms of the settlement were: (1) Recognition of Mysore Congress; (2) declaration by the Mysore Government that it is open to the Reforms Committee to discuss and recommend responsible Government for Mysore State; (3) four Congress men who resigned from the Reforms Committee to be renominated with three additional Congressmen to be selected by the State Congress; (4) the satyagraha to be called off by the State Congress; (5) general amnesty to political prisoners and withdrawal of all repressive orders; and (6) the flag dispute to be settled on the lines suggested by Mahatma Gandhi, namely, that the Congress flag should be flown along with the State flag on all ceremonial occasions.
('73', 158, 10, 21, 318397) But at purely party functions of the Congress only the National flag is to be flown.

('73', 159, 1, 2, 318524) Regarding the release of the Delhi political prisoners, Mahatma Gandhi said that the question of their release was before him.
('73', 159, 1, 3, 318651) He would do his utmost to secure it, but at the moment he could not say as to when he would take up the matter.

('73', 159, 4, 10, 319028) You have certainly made progress.
('73', 159, 4, 11, 319062) But you have still a long way to go.
('73', 159, 4, 12, 319099) You will acquire steadiness by observing rules in all matters.

('73', 159, 10, 24, 319548) I am afraid she may break down.
('73', 159, 10, 25, 319580) It will be terrible if that happens.
('73', 159, 10, 26, 319617) I would not in any way feel sorry if she were to find happiness by going away from me and this atmosphere.
('73', 159, 10, 27, 319724) Then I would feel that I had no right to keep her.
('73', 159, 10, 28, 319775) But, then, who am I?
('73', 159, 10, 29, 319796) Do I know her?
('73', 159, 10, 30, 319811) Or, if I know her, why am I not in a position to explain what I see?
('73', 159, 10, 31, 319880) Your profound love can save her.
('73', 159, 10, 32, 319913) Her bitter experiences here will be like medicine to her.
('73', 159, 10, 33, 319971) Do not be hasty in anything.
('73', 159, 10, 34, 320000) For the sake of Sushila, stay there as long as you must.
('73', 159, 10, 35, 320057) It is possible that she has now understood a lot on her own and is calm and cheerful.
('73', 159, 10, 36, 320143) In that case you can perhaps return early.

('73', 162, 3, 4, 322790) My silence should not in any case stand between us.
('73', 162, 3, 5, 322842) I have nothing to say about Nanavati.
('73', 162, 3, 6, 322880) I only wanted to know all that might be said about him.
('73', 162, 3, 7, 322936) I have organized myself in such a way that his or anyone elses going will not inconvenience me.
('73', 162, 3, 8, 323032) It is not necessary for Nanavati to stay here whenever I am here.
('73', 162, 3, 9, 323098) When he serves you I consider it as service to me.
('73', 162, 3, 10, 323149) Nanavati is staying here to know what village life is and to find out what part he can play in it.
('73', 162, 3, 11, 323248) He is mainly useful as a musician and when everyone leaves Segaon he would stay on and die here.
('73', 162, 3, 12, 323345) It is quite difficult to explain the usefulness of such a man.
('73', 162, 3, 13, 323408) But it is enough if, even while staying with you, he remembers that he has to pass his life in Segaon.
('73', 162, 3, 14, 323511) In this way he can retain his self respect and keep his word too.
('73', 162, 3, 15, 323577) So I think it is his dharma to go from here so long as you need him.
('73', 162, 3, 16, 323646) But if deep down in his heart he has lost interest in Segaon, he should unhesitatingly take his mind off Segaon.
('73', 162, 3, 17, 323759) His aim in life would then be to follow in your footsteps and take up Hindi.
('73', 162, 3, 18, 323836) This is the proper age for him to fix his aim.
('73', 162, 3, 19, 323883) I have very little use for him when I am in Segaon because for the most part Kanu takes up the responsibility for music.
('73', 162, 3, 20, 324004) At present his main job in Segaon is to propagate weaving and to think of and experiment on village sanitation.
('73', 162, 3, 21, 324116) These two tasks are very important.
('73', 162, 3, 22, 324152) The result may not be visible today but eventually it will grow into a big tree.
('73', 162, 3, 23, 324233) This aspect may however be ignored for the present.
('73', 162, 3, 24, 324285) It is good I am observing silence, so that you can ponder over this note.
('73', 162, 3, 25, 324359) Yet if you want to discuss something I am prepared to talk.
('73', 162, 3, 26, 324419) Todays silence leaves room for such violations.

('73', 162, 6, 29, 324544) May 14, 1938
('73', 162, 7, 30, 324557) MUNNALAL, You shall certainly know about my agony.
('73', 162, 7, 31, 324608) You may ask Mirabehn.
('73', 162, 8, 32, 324630) 1 The note was subsequently sent to Nanavati.

('73', 163, 1, 2, 324762) This is how you and Kanchan should live.
('73', 163, 1, 3, 324803) You should not meet alone, nor touch each other.
('73', 163, 1, 4, 324852) If either of you is aroused in the presence of the other, and if you are keen on observing brahmacharya at present, you should stay away from each other.
('73', 163, 1, 5, 325006) Dont suppress passion forcibly.
('73', 163, 1, 6, 325038) If you desire from the depths of your heart to observe brahmacharya, you will certainly be able to overcome your passion.
('73', 163, 1, 7, 325160) If you are inspired to observe brahmacharya merely because it is good, it will not be enough.
('73', 163, 1, 8, 325254) You may be certain that it can be observed only if you are convinced that without it you cannot shape your life aright.
('73', 163, 1, 9, 325374) The rest when we meet.

('73', 163, 5, 15, 325553) Now that is over.
('73', 163, 5, 16, 325571) You must build up your health.
('73', 163, 5, 17, 325602) You should live on butter milk, milk, rice if you can digest it, and juicy fruits like mosambis.
('73', 163, 5, 18, 325699) You need no medicine.
('73', 163, 5, 19, 325721) Mirabehn will write about my health.

('73', 164, 3, 5, 326006) I am at Juhu.
('73', 164, 3, 6, 326020) If you let me know, somebody will go to the station to receive you.
('73', 164, 3, 7, 326088) I shall most probaly leave here on the 17th or the 18th.

('73', 164, 8, 11, 326258) JUHU May 14, 1938
('73', 164, 9, 12, 326276) PYARELAL, I have received your letters.
('73', 164, 9, 13, 326316) I have had Mahadev read them all.
('73', 164, 9, 14, 326350) You will learn more from Sushilas letter.
('73', 164, 9, 15, 326392) It is a good thing for me that Sushila seems to be coming out of her stupor.
('73', 164, 9, 16, 326469) A great burden will be off my mind if she returns to her original self and devotes herself to whatever she considers her duty.
('73', 164, 9, 17, 326596) After I had written the above, I got another letter from you.
('73', 164, 9, 18, 326658) I can bear this distance because you are with Sushila.
('73', 164, 9, 19, 326713) I would not have been able to stand it had she been alone in Delhi.
('73', 164, 9, 20, 326781) I have compared her to a tender plant and the comparison is very apt.
('73', 164, 9, 21, 326851) It was not in the least difficult for me to understand the purpose of Sushilas letter.
('73', 164, 9, 22, 326938) I have never believed that she would deliberately resort to a lie in speech or action.
('73', 164, 9, 23, 327025) Sushila acted as if in a stupor.
('73', 164, 9, 24, 327058) With the exception of going to the toilet, every action of hers was in my view a lie.
('73', 164, 9, 25, 327144) Once we accept the state of stupor, it is unnecessary to impute to her any other fault.
('73', 164, 9, 26, 327232) The incident of that night only supports this contention.
('73', 164, 9, 27, 327290) It has no other relevance.
('73', 164, 9, 28, 327317) Sushila is unnecessarily being angry with herself.
('73', 164, 9, 29, 327368) There will be no time to write separately to her about it.
('73', 164, 9, 30, 327427) Plead with her on my behalf and console her.
('73', 164, 9, 31, 327472) Is she cheerful?
('73', 164, 9, 32, 327489) Does she laugh?
('73', 164, 9, 33, 327505) If she does
('73', 165, 0, 1, 327517) 166 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 165, 1, 2, 327559) not laugh, how can she be stupid?
('73', 165, 1, 3, 327593) If she accepts the adjective I have used for her, she must forget her unhappiness and prove her stupidity.
('73', 165, 1, 4, 327700) Do not the foolish and the wise have some common characteristics?
('73', 165, 2, 5, 327766) If your understanding of [the incidents of] the 14th in day time and of the 9th night is different, what is there in it to make you shudder or render you unhappy?
('73', 165, 2, 6, 327929) Am I omniscient?
('73', 165, 2, 7, 327946) My under standing has not always been correct.
('73', 165, 2, 8, 327993) And on this occasion, I see myself distressed and senile; so what wonder if I act like a jaundiced man who sees everything yellow?
('73', 165, 2, 9, 328124) Hence, have no fear about my being firm.
('73', 165, 2, 10, 328165) Right now, I am beginning to give more importance to the view of the other party rather than to my own.Please therefore let me know your interpretation in clear terms and without any fear.
('73', 165, 2, 11, 328354) If I find it acceptable, it will not take me long to change my view.
('73', 165, 3, 12, 328423) When would you prepare rotis for me?
('73', 165, 3, 13, 328460) Sushila is confused.
('73', 165, 3, 14, 328481) Only you can show her the straight path.
('73', 165, 3, 15, 328522) Take whatever time is necessary to do that.

('73', 165, 7, 17, 328581) I hope to leave here for Wardha on the 17th.

('73', 166, 2, 3, 328840) BOMBAY, May 15, 1938
('73', 166, 3, 4, 328861) DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB, I thank you for your letter 1 of the 11th instant received yester day.
('73', 166, 3, 5, 328951) I showed it today to Subhas Babu.
('73', 166, 3, 6, 328985) I must confess that it does not satisfy my expectations.
('73', 166, 3, 7, 329042) At the same time, I fully recognize the labours given to the question by the Government.
('73', 166, 3, 8, 329131) I can also appre ciate their extreme caution.
('73', 166, 3, 9, 329177) I am not, therefore, going to come to any hasty decision.
('73', 166, 3, 10, 329235) But before I can examine the implications of the policy adumbrated in your letter, I should like to know the number of prisoners that will still remain to be dealt with after the operation of the first three clauses.
('73', 166, 3, 11, 329452) And before I can come to any conclusion, it will be absolutely necesary for me to know how the prisoners will respond to the propositions laid down by the Government.
('73', 166, 3, 12, 329619) I can well understand from your standpoint that such a pro cedure may not be countenanced.
('73', 166, 3, 13, 329710) But I am bound by a moral pro mise given to the prisoners and in pursuance thereof, if the whole programme is to work smoothly, it is necesary for me to know their mind.
('73', 166, 3, 14, 329880) It would be a breach of promise on my part if I submitted without demur to anything less than almost immediate and un conditional discharge.
('73', 166, 3, 15, 330021) I am sure you will not ask me for this purpose to travel to Calcutta.
('73', 166, 3, 16, 330091) I would, therefore, ask you kindly to grant permission either to Subhas Babu or to Sarat Babu to see the prisoners as my deputies.
('73', 166, 3, 17, 330222) Of course, your request for secrecy will be strictly respected.
('73', 166, 3, 18, 330286) Subhas Babu has not seen this letter.
('73', 166, 3, 19, 330324) He is engaged in the Working Committee meeting away from where I am staying, but if he was here, I am sure he would share the views expressed herein.

('73', 167, 3, 6, 330770) Last year you learnt the Gita by heart.
('73', 167, 3, 7, 330810) What will you do this year?
('73', 167, 3, 8, 330838) Does Purushottam pass your pronunciation?
('73', 167, 3, 9, 330880) Finally, of course, it will have to be passed by me.
('73', 167, 3, 10, 330933) He might even show partiality towards you.
('73', 167, 3, 11, 330976) After all, isnt he your teacher?

('73', 168, 3, 4, 331660) PYARELAL, You will have received my letter of yesterday.
('73', 168, 3, 5, 331717) Mahadev has been terribly hurt by your letter.
('73', 168, 3, 6, 331764) He has been crying.
('73', 168, 3, 7, 331784) He had already been anguished and given to crying.
('73', 168, 3, 8, 331835) Your letter has added to his agony.
('73', 168, 3, 9, 331871) However, it is just as well that you have expressed through this letter whatever was weighting on your mind.
('73', 168, 3, 10, 331980) That is the only way to regain mental composure and to be cleansed of the kind of suspicions and prejudices lurking there.
('73', 168, 3, 11, 332103) Mahadev has not written the letter under pressure from me as a last resort.
('73', 168, 3, 12, 332179) Yes, the letter was the result of his discussion with me.
('73', 168, 3, 13, 332237) But it was not written under pressure.
('73', 168, 3, 14, 332276) His pen moved because he felt that his writing the letter would be justified.
('73', 168, 3, 15, 332354) All arguments were his own.
('73', 168, 3, 16, 332382) Mahadev wrote to you on his own and the letter was full of anguish.
('73', 168, 3, 17, 332450) That is why I did not allow it to go.
('73', 168, 3, 18, 332488) It would have only intensified the misery and there would have been more misunder standing.
('73', 168, 3, 19, 332580) Now he has decided to stop writing to both of you for the time being.
('73', 168, 3, 20, 332650) I have approved of this decision.
('73', 168, 3, 21, 332684) You and Sushila may write if you feel like doing so.
('73', 168, 3, 22, 332737) You can even write if the absence of Mahadevs letters irks you.
('73', 168, 3, 23, 332801) Mahadev had told Sushila that he would write [to her] about my health.
('73', 168, 3, 24, 332872) But for thetime being even that has been stopped.
('73', 168, 3, 25, 332922) In any case, I would be writing almost every day.
('73', 168, 3, 26, 332972) Hence, you would continue to get the news.
('73', 168, 3, 27, 333015) This should not lead to the conclusion that I have suggested to Mahadev not to write to you, since the idea was Mahadevs.
('73', 168, 3, 28, 333137) I have given it my approval for the time being.
('73', 168, 3, 29, 333185) The past, except when it is essential for the present, needs to be forgotten.
('73', 168, 3, 30, 333263) I wish to discuss the past only to be certain that I have not done any injustice either to Mahadev or to Sushila.
('73', 168, 3, 31, 333377) No one has deliberately committed mistakes.
('73', 168, 3, 32, 333421) That is sufficient consolation for me.
('73', 168, 3, 33, 333460) It should be so for Mahadev and Sushila as well.
('73', 168, 3, 34, 333509) Where there was no wrong at all, I saw wrong and insisted that all of you should also see it.
('73', 168, 3, 35, 333603) I wish I had not committed such a grave sin.
('73', 168, 3, 36, 333648) You can be of great help in my quest to find out.
('73', 168, 3, 37, 333698) Do not conceal the truth from me by showing me undeserved pity.
('73', 168, 3, 38, 333762) Of course I know that you will not stay on there a

('73', 169, 1, 2, 333855) moment longer than necessary and I am not therefore impatient.
('73', 169, 1, 3, 333918) My blood pressure is not checked every day.
('73', 169, 1, 4, 333962) What daily news then can I give about my health?
('73', 169, 1, 5, 334011) My own diagnosis says that my health is fine.
('73', 169, 1, 6, 334057) I sleep well.
('73', 169, 1, 7, 334071) I take my walks regularly.
('73', 169, 1, 8, 334098) I eat well.
('73', 169, 1, 9, 334110) Perhaps mangoes are a little difficult to digest.
('73', 169, 1, 10, 334160) I do a fairly good amount of work.
('73', 169, 1, 11, 334195) It does not show any adverse effect.
('73', 169, 1, 12, 334232) I lie down in the bath tub.

('73', 172, 3, 7, 338050) Kanti and Saraswati are here.
('73', 172, 3, 8, 338080) Most probably they will go to Matunga.

('73', 172, 3, 12, 338277) He may have some relief from heat, too.
('73', 172, 3, 13, 338317) If he should go to Dehra Dun, I feel that it would not be proper for him to stay there for more than a day or two.
('73', 172, 3, 14, 338432) Pyarelal and Sushila are there in Delhi.
('73', 172, 3, 15, 338473) Both of them or Pyarelal alone may perhaps accompany you.
('73', 172, 3, 16, 338531) However, consult Devdas and do what you like.

('73', 173, 7, 11, 339647) STUPID DAUGHTER SUSHILA, I received Pyarelals letter after I had already written to you.
('73', 173, 7, 12, 339736) He writes that [you think] you have lost for ever the place you had in my heart and that consequently you have lost your lustre.
('73', 173, 7, 13, 339865) This has disturbed me.
('73', 173, 7, 14, 339888) Your place with me remains as it was.
('73', 173, 7, 15, 339926) I cannot understand why you should think otherwise.
('73', 173, 7, 16, 339978) You should cast the doubt out of your mind.
('73', 173, 7, 17, 340022) The truth is that perhaps I am not the same to you now as I was.
('73', 173, 7, 18, 340087) But I have no fear.
('73', 173, 7, 19, 340107) If I am true, your doubt will be dispelled.
('73', 173, 7, 20, 340151) I do have a fear that I may have unwittingly been unfair to you.
('73', 173, 7, 21, 340216) But I am not writing this to tell you of my woes.
('73', 173, 7, 22, 340266) You should at least believe this much, that you have not lost your place with me.

('73', 173, 13, 30, 340563) PYARELAL, There was no letter from you yesterday.
('73', 173, 13, 31, 340613) It would be good if you did not keep me without letters these days.
('73', 173, 13, 32, 340681) I am now putting out of my mind the distress of Mahadev and Sushila.
('73', 173, 13, 33, 340750) It should now be considered entirely a matter of the past.
('73', 173, 13, 34, 340809) I am sending today by book post three letters from Mirabehn.
('73', 173, 13, 35, 340870) Both you brother and sister

('73', 174, 1, 2, 340948) may peruse the letters and let me know your reaction.
('73', 174, 1, 3, 341002) Is not Mirabehns description similar to that of Ravanas palace by Tulsidas?
('73', 174, 1, 4, 341078) Ravana is lying unconscious and his numerous queens are reclining around him in various states of undress.
('73', 174, 1, 5, 341185) I laughed and cried when I read it.
('73', 174, 1, 6, 341221) How could I have been affected in that way ?
('73', 174, 1, 7, 341266) Disregarding Mirabehns exaggeration, I was affected by what remained in the letter and I wrote that I would change my practice.
('73', 174, 1, 8, 341394) What if the suffering witnessed on the 14th was the result of those physical contacts?
('73', 174, 1, 9, 341481) So far I have not found any clear evidence to conclude that it could not have been so.
('73', 174, 1, 10, 341568) Then have all these women become impure by my touch ?
('73', 174, 1, 11, 341622) If that is so, have I been like that from the beginning.
('73', 174, 1, 12, 341679) In that case, is the peace that some women and young men are supposed to have found by being close to me a delusion ?
('73', 174, 1, 13, 341797) If that is the case, do I have a place in the world?
('73', 174, 1, 14, 341850) Who am I to find fault with Mahadev and Sushila?
('73', 174, 1, 15, 341899) Who can say that I may not be thrusting my own faults on them?
('73', 174, 1, 16, 341962) What have you all gained from me?
('73', 174, 1, 17, 341996) Is it only disappointment?
('73', 174, 1, 18, 342023) Would it be proper for me to guide you?
('73', 174, 1, 19, 342063) Such thoughts pass through my mind.
('73', 174, 1, 20, 342099) I am maintaining my calm in the midst of this turmoil.
('73', 174, 1, 21, 342154) My attention is centred on you.
('73', 174, 1, 22, 342186) If you remain composed then I may regain my self confidence.
('73', 174, 1, 23, 342247) Your action will help me only if it is natural.
('73', 174, 1, 24, 342295) Or, if I find that whatever steps you take express your sense of duty, then too I shall feel at ease.
('73', 174, 1, 25, 342397) This means that I have found the guru that I have been looking for.
('73', 174, 1, 26, 342465) I shall consider myself fortunate if that happens.
('73', 174, 1, 27, 342516) It is my belief that suchshould be the result of my training.
('73', 174, 1, 28, 342578) I shall attain glory only if those who are my heirs have reached higher than I. Right now I see you, Mahadev, Sushila, etc., as occupying a loftier place.
('73', 174, 1, 29, 342733) This does not mean that now I cannot guide you in any matter at all.
('73', 174, 1, 30, 342802) But it does mean that if the experience of the 14th is indicative of my generally diseased mind, the situation in which all of you sustained yourselves would have reduced me to bits!
('73', 174, 1, 31, 342985) I shall not elaborate further.
('73', 174, 1, 32, 343016) If possible, decide about the time of your coming.
('73', 174, 1, 33, 343067) After you receive this letter, write to me at the Wardha address.
('73', 174, 1, 34, 343133) Todays post has not yet arrived.
('73', 174, 1, 35, 343166) I expect to hear that Sushila has regained her calm.

('73', 175, 6, 16, 343934) I cannot put up with your looking sullen.
('73', 175, 6, 17, 343976) Is not one Pyarelal enough?

('73', 175, 6, 19, 344089) I have told nothing to anyone.
('73', 175, 6, 20, 344120) I told only Mirabehn that I had conveyed her complaint to both of you.
('73', 175, 6, 21, 344191) What is your fault after all?
('73', 175, 6, 22, 344221) I am at fault in having accused a young man likeMahadev and a pure girl like you.
('73', 175, 6, 23, 344303) Is this not all that I can tell anyone?
('73', 175, 6, 24, 344343) Why should you make me more unhappy by being unhappy about it?
('73', 175, 6, 25, 344406) If you can bear with me, keep a cheerful face and absorb yourself in service.
('73', 175, 6, 26, 344484) If there is even a little purity and love in me, Pyarelal will be saved and with him both of us will be saved too.
('73', 175, 6, 27, 344599) Otherwise, both of us will be ruined.
('73', 175, 6, 28, 344637) Keep this letter with you.
('73', 175, 6, 29, 344664) I am afraid of somebody reading it if it is left with me.
('73', 175, 6, 30, 344722) Ultimately it has to be destroyed.

('73', 176, 10, 16, 345428) SUSHILA,
('73', 176, 11, 17, 345437) After reading Mahadevs letter, you must neither get angry nor abandon me.
('73', 176, 11, 18, 345511) I have spared nothing in making you unhappy.
('73', 176, 11, 19, 345556) I do not regret it.
('73', 176, 11, 20, 345576) Whatever I did was for your good.
('73', 176, 11, 21, 345610) If you remain unhappy there, it will be breach of promise.
('73', 176, 11, 22, 345669) If you are not tired of me, both of you should come back at once.
('73', 176, 11, 23, 345735) Pyarelals parting from me is like Shravanas being snatched from his parents.
('73', 176, 11, 24, 345812) I do not have so much right over you.
('73', 176, 11, 25, 345850) If I remain alive, you will be convinced one day.

('73', 177, 7, 11, 346378) PYARELAL, Your letter to Mahadev is shocking.
('73', 177, 7, 12, 346424) It would seem of all the people you are the most distressed.
('73', 177, 7, 13, 346485) If anyone has to be distressed, it should rightly be I. I shall put up with your absence so long as you remain cheerful there.
('73', 177, 7, 14, 346612) Otherwise it would be unbearable.
('73', 177, 7, 15, 346646) I for one feel that it will be good for you to come away.
('73', 177, 7, 16, 346704) My state of health is described in the letter to Sushila.
('73', 177, 7, 17, 346762) Even from that point of view it may be necessary for you to come.
('73', 177, 7, 18, 346828) Maybe it would be inadvisable for me to be unrestrained.
('73', 177, 7, 19, 346885) I must definitely have your reaction.
('73', 177, 7, 20, 346923) How would that distress me?
('73', 177, 7, 21, 346951) You may be sure I am calm.
('73', 177, 7, 22, 346978) Mahadevs greatest sorrow is that he has lost his place with you.
('73', 177, 7, 23, 347043) Unwittingly, he has caused you untold misery.
('73', 177, 7, 24, 347089) I am persuading him.
('73', 177, 7, 25, 347110) Wipe his tears if you can.
('73', 177, 7, 26, 347137) Do not deprive me of your letter even for a day.

('73', 178, 2, 3, 347410) May 18, 1938
('73', 178, 3, 4, 347423) STUPID DAUGHTER, You have been proving your stupidity in every letter.
('73', 178, 3, 5, 347494) Yes, I did say that if you were tired of Segaon then I had not been entitled to receive service from you.
('73', 178, 3, 6, 347600) This could not in any way imply that you should not come to me.
('73', 178, 3, 7, 347664) It did imply that you should hasten your return.
('73', 178, 3, 8, 347713) If your mind cannot grasp such a simple thing, ask me again.
('73', 178, 3, 9, 347774) In this context let me describe to you my condition.
('73', 178, 3, 10, 347827) These two days have not passed well.
('73', 178, 3, 11, 347864) Yesterday I worked for 12 hours.
('73', 178, 3, 12, 347897) I was mentally exhausted.
('73', 178, 3, 13, 347923) I had a terrible backache.
('73', 178, 3, 14, 347950) I slept well.
('73', 178, 3, 15, 347964) I was alert again.
('73', 178, 3, 16, 347983) But the mental condition is not good.
('73', 178, 3, 17, 348021) In such a situation I do feel your absence.
('73', 178, 3, 18, 348065) But how can I send for you, how can I ask you to come so long as you do not feel drawn to this place?
('73', 178, 3, 19, 348167) Would I have been able to work so much if you had been near me?
('73', 178, 3, 20, 348231) Now do you understand what I want?
('73', 178, 3, 21, 348266) But this certainly does not mean that you should come here at once under any circumstances.
('73', 178, 3, 22, 348358) Now your second question.
('73', 178, 3, 23, 348384) I accept your version of what happ ened on the 9th night.
('73', 178, 3, 24, 348442) There is no question of your account being incorrect.
('73', 178, 3, 25, 348496) Those who see silver in a sea shell are right at all times.
('73', 178, 3, 26, 348556) But he who knows a sea shell will see it only as a sea shell, will he not?
('73', 178, 3, 27, 348631) Oh, the things that sexual impulse makes us do!
('73', 178, 3, 28, 348679) This does not even mean that I am in the right and what you thought was merely imagination.
('73', 178, 3, 29, 348771) Believe me, I admit I may have been a prey to illusion; so you can stick to your own position.
('73', 178, 3, 30, 348866) Indeed it is your duty to do so.
('73', 178, 3, 31, 348899) Ponder that verse in the Bhajanavali.
('73', 178, 3, 32, 348937) Only that is dharma which is followed by the learned and practised by the saintly and by peoplefree from attachment and hatred, and which your heart accepts as dharma.
('73', 178, 3, 33, 349105) What the learned, the saintly and people free from attachment, etc., believe can never be acceptable to us if our heart does not accept it.
('73', 178, 3, 34, 349245) I am neither a learned man, nor a saint; nor am I free from attachment, etc.
('73', 178, 3, 35, 349322) I have only appointed myself your godfather.
('73', 178, 3, 36, 349367) The words of such a man must be rejected unless your heart and mind accept them.
('73', 178, 3, 37, 349448) Whatever you do, your position with me will always remain the same.
('73', 178, 3, 38, 349516) In no way have you fallen in my estimation.
('73', 178, 3, 39, 349560) Yes, a mans words should be taken at their face value.
('73', 178, 3, 40, 349615) But even
('73', 179, 0, 1, 349624) 180 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 179, 1, 2, 349666) so, one must consider their context.
('73', 179, 1, 3, 349703) That is to say, while it is necessary to exercise discretion, we must take it that if the reasons which dictate avoidance of physical contact are applicable to any other behaviour or gestures, such gestures, too must be avoided.
('73', 179, 1, 4, 349932) So much for the literal interpretation.
('73', 179, 1, 5, 349972) But even this much is not sufficient.
('73', 179, 1, 6, 350010) To know the meaning of words it is also necessary to know their deeper signifi cance.
('73', 179, 1, 7, 350096) When you recite the Gita every day, you know the literal meaning of the words.
('73', 179, 1, 8, 350175) But so long as you do not understand their deeper significance, going by the literal meaning of the words would be futile and burdensome.
('73', 179, 1, 9, 350313) Does this fully answer your letter?
('73', 179, 1, 10, 350349) We shall probably leave here on the 20th.
('73', 179, 1, 11, 350391) I have torn up your letter.
('73', 179, 1, 12, 350419) Mahadev does not read your letters these days.
('73', 179, 1, 13, 350466) He sees what I write.
('73', 179, 1, 14, 350488) He continues to be miserable.
('73', 179, 1, 15, 350518) That is in his nature.
('73', 179, 1, 16, 350541) Time will do its work.
('73', 179, 1, 17, 350564) Is not Kaala 1 one of the names for God?

('73', 179, 6, 23, 350765) [May 18, 1938] 3
('73', 179, 7, 24, 350782) The Working Committee has read the popular and official versions of the recent firing that took place near Vidhuraswatham in Mysore on an unarmed crowd.
('73', 179, 7, 25, 350935) The Committee deplores the fact that the State authorities felt called upon to resort to firing.
('73', 179, 7, 26, 351032) On seeing that the Mysore government has appointed a tribunal to inquire into the causes that led to the firing, the Working Committee refrains from expressing any opinion on the tragedy.
('73', 179, 7, 27, 351220) But the Working Committee thinks that H.H. the Maharaja should establish responsible govern ment in his State so that the responsibility for law and order including firing, whenever it is deemed necessary, will be shouldered by a government answerable to the people.
('73', 179, 7, 28, 351487) The Working Committee sends its condolences to the members of the bereaved families and expresses its sympathy with those who suffered injuries.
('73', 179, 8, 29, 351632) 1 Time 2 According to The Bombay Chronicle, 19 5 1938 the resolution drafted by Gandhiji was discussed by the Working Committe on May 18 and passed the following day.
('73', 180, 0, 1, 351799) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 181
('73', 180, 1, 2, 351849) The Committee approves of the settlement effected by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Acharya Kripalani as between the Mysore State and the Mysore State Congress.
('73', 180, 1, 3, 352008) The Working Committee notes with satisfaction that in furtherance of the settlement the Mysore Govern ment have issued a communique, 1 and congratulates H. H. the Maha raja and his advisers on the prompt manner in which they are carrying out the settlement.
('73', 180, 1, 4, 352266) The Working Committee hopes that the settlement will be strictly carried out also by the Mysore State Con gress.
('73', 180, 1, 5, 352379) On the question of hoisting the national flag the Working Committee hopes that care will be taken not to do anything that may imply any disrespect to the State flag by the State Congress or the national flag by the State authorities.
('73', 180, 1, 6, 352613) 2 The final status of the national flag will depend not upon the ability to exercise compulsion but upon the correct conduct of Congressmen and the progressive record of service that the Congress establishes in the country.
('73', 180, 1, 7, 352837) It should further be borne in mind that the national flag is the symbol of non violence and national unity to be brought about by means strictly truthful and non violent.
('73', 180, 1, 8, 353008) It should further be borne in mind that though there is a growing party among Congressmen who seeks the total abolition of States as a relic of the Middle Ages, the policy of the Congress as a whole has hitherto been and remains one of friendliness to the States in the hope that they will recognize the signs of the times and establish
('73', 180, 2, 9, 353345) 1 The communique of the Mysore Government dated May 17, stated that: (i) The Government would recognize the Mysore State Congress provided it co operated with the Government in the task of constitutional reforms and carried on its activities in a peaceful and constitutional manner.
('73', 180, 2, 10, 353628) (ii) The Government would add three new members selected by the Mysore State Congress on the committee on constitutional reforms.
('73', 180, 2, 11, 353758) (iii) On all ceremonial occasions the Mysore flag and the flag of Indian National Congress would be hoisted.
('73', 180, 2, 12, 353867) (iv) The Mysore State Congress would withdraw the civil disobedience and no tax campaigns.
('73', 180, 2, 13, 353958) (v) All the political prisoners would be released and the prohibitory orders withdrawn.
('73', 180, 3, 14, 354046) 2 The Hindu, 20 5 1938, carried the following report:  Mahatma Gandhi has instructed the Mysore State Congressmen to hoist first the Mysore State flag, that is, give precedence to the Mysore flag on all ceremonial occasions when they hoist the national flag, as a mark of their loyalty to the Ruler and in order to avoid any conflict.

('73', 182, 1, 2, 355404) 207. STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 1
('73', 182, 2, 3, 355434) BOMBAY, May 20, 1938 Sardar Prithvi Singh, who has been just taken in custody by the collector of Bombay Suburban District, is a life sentence prisoner in connection with what is known as the first Lahore Conspiracy Case of 1915. He served part of the sentence in the Andamans, and when as a result of public agitation that criminal settlement was closed, Sardar Prithvi Singh was transferred to Madras and then to Rajahmundry.
('73', 182, 2, 4, 355862) There, having grown tired of jail life, he made two attempts to abscond.
('73', 182, 2, 5, 355935) He succeeded in the second attempt in 1922, and has ever since succeeded in eluding the police.
('73', 182, 2, 6, 356031) He is a self made man.
('73', 182, 2, 7, 356054) He is a leading revolutionary and for some time has been revising his views on armed revolution, and ultimately decided in consultation with his friends to surrender himself to me and be guided by me.
('73', 182, 2, 8, 356255) After having had a full conversation with him, I decided to take charge of him, and told him that according to my view of life there could be no secrecy and voluntary surrender to authorities was in itself a service to the country.
('73', 182, 2, 9, 356487) He recognized the force of my opinion.
('73', 182, 2, 10, 356526) He came to me on the morning of the 18th, and I wrote to the District Magistrate on the 19th, informing him that Sardar Prithvi Singh had surrendered himself to me, and that I was about to put myself in communication with the Government of India with a view to securing his discharge, and that if the District Magistrate could not legally allow Sardar Prithvi Singh to remain with me, he was at liberty to take him into custody.
('73', 182, 2, 11, 356955) The District Magistrate wrote to me to say that he had no authority to leave him free.
('73', 182, 2, 12, 357042) He himself accompanied by the Superin tendent of Police arrested him today at 1 p.m.
('73', 182, 2, 13, 357127) at our residence at Juhu.

('73', 182, 3, 15, 357233) I had asked Sardar Prithvi Singh to write an account of his career.
('73', 182, 3, 16, 357301) It is a thrilling romance.

('73', 183, 1, 3, 357792) He developed revolutionary ideas in Canada where he had migrated in his youth.
('73', 183, 1, 4, 357871) He was witness to the illegal and shameful turning away of the Coma Gata Maru from the Canadian shore, and he and a band of Indian settlers in Canada decided to return to India and lead a revolution.
('73', 183, 1, 5, 358071) After absconding he has evidently made himself useful to the nation in various ways.
('73', 183, 1, 6, 358156) He is very powerfully built Rajput.
('73', 183, 1, 7, 358192) Five months of hunger strike in the Andamans and injuries received, whether in scuffles with the police or in escaping from custody, have left no visible trace of weakness on his body.
('73', 183, 1, 8, 358377) He became a first class gym nastics teacher and studied the science of physical culture and the art of massage, and gave training in physical culture in many schools.
('73', 183, 1, 9, 358544) To seek the relief of the political prisoners has come to me in the later years of my life as a God sent mission.
('73', 183, 1, 10, 358658) To strive for the early discharge of Sardar Prithvi Singh is the latest addition to this mission.
('73', 183, 1, 11, 358756) He tells me that he is endeavouring to examine the method of non violence for the deliverance of the country.
('73', 183, 1, 12, 358866) He says that many of his past revolutionary companions are thinking along these lines.
('73', 183, 1, 13, 358953) He has no other aim in life but the freedom of India.
('73', 183, 1, 14, 359007) I was so much taken up by the sincerity with which he talked to me that I had no difficulty in taking his word at its face value, and I should love to have men like him as fellow pilgrims in the pilgrimage to the temple of freedom,

('73', 184, 3, 4, 359732) MY DEAR C. R.,
('73', 184, 4, 5, 359747) I had two hours and a half with friend Jinnah yesterday.
('73', 184, 4, 6, 359804) The talk was cordial but not hopeful, yet not without hope.
('73', 184, 4, 7, 359864) I must not enter into the details of the conversation, but he complained bitterly of Hindi having been imposed in particular areas of Madras in primary schools.
('73', 184, 4, 8, 360025) What is exactly the position?
('73', 184, 4, 9, 360055) Are Mussalman boys affected?
('73', 184, 4, 10, 360084) Please send me as early a reply as possible and one that I could publicly use.
('73', 184, 5, 11, 360163) I had a long chat with Jawaharlal about the Communist party.
('73', 184, 5, 12, 360224) I think we understand each other better than before on this particular question.
('73', 184, 5, 13, 360305) He says [in] the Communist Partys programme, there is no violence, there is no secrecy.
('73', 184, 5, 14, 360393) Why should it [be] banned therefore as such?
('73', 184, 5, 15, 360438) If any communist or party resorts to violence openly or secretly or incites to violence they must be dealt with not because of allegiance to a particular party, but because of violence.
('73', 184, 5, 16, 360624) Thus the author of the writing that you showed me can clearly be dealt with under law, not because there is a ban on the Communist [Party] but because the writing itself has a criminal taint.
('73', 184, 5, 17, 360816) Have you anything against this argument?
('73', 184, 5, 18, 360857) If the ban is lifted, what will happen?
('73', 184, 6, 19, 360897) I hope you have received the official reply from Subhas.
('73', 184, 6, 20, 360954) It enables you to deal with your correspondent.

('73', 185, 2, 3, 361103) SEGAON, WARDHA, May 21, 1938
('73', 185, 3, 4, 361132) DEAR FRIEND, Sardar Prithvi Singh is an old revolutionary who, belonging to a party that believed in armed revolution, was one of the odd hundred Indians, who being enraged over the treatment meted out to the passengers of the Kamagata Maru who vainly sought legal landing on the Canadian shore, took their passage to India with the avowed purpose, I believe, of causing trouble.
('73', 185, 3, 5, 361512) Sardar Prithvi Singh was tried and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.
('73', 185, 3, 6, 361583) He was then tried in what is known as the first Lahore Conspiracy case of 1915 and was sentenced to transportation for life, and was sent to the Andamans.
('73', 185, 3, 7, 361738) When the penal settlement was broken up, he, with many other prisoners was transferred to Madras and thence to Rajahmundry.
('73', 185, 3, 8, 361862) On the way he absconded  this was in 1922and successfully evaded capture.
('73', 185, 3, 9, 361936) All these years of hiding he passed in studying the science of physical culture, and was responsible for training hundreds of youths.
('73', 185, 3, 10, 362070) But this life gave him no satisfaction.
('73', 185, 3, 11, 362110) He fell in the company of those who believe in the non violent method.
('73', 185, 3, 12, 362181) He seems to have developed faith in non violence.
('73', 185, 3, 13, 362231) On the 18th instant, he surrendered himself to me, and put himself under my guidance.
('73', 185, 3, 14, 362317) I told him that I would love to keep him with me, watch him, and engage him in constructive national activity if the Government left him free.
('73', 185, 3, 15, 362460) But I told him also that I could not keep him without informing the Government of what I was doing.
('73', 185, 3, 16, 362560) On the 19th instant, therefore, I wrote to the Collector of the Suburban District in Bombay (for I was living in Juhu) telling him that if he had no authority to let Sardar Prithvi Singh remain with me, the Sardar was ready to be arrested.
('73', 185, 3, 17, 362800) Yesterday the District Magistrate came to Juhu and arrested Sardar Prithvi Singh and lodged him in Thana Jail as an  A class prisoner.
('73', 185, 4, 18, 362935) I have given only the bare outline of Sardar Prithvi Singhs activities.
('73', 185, 4, 19, 363007) I feel that persons like Sardar Prithvi Singh should be given an opportunity of leading a useful life, instead of being kept in custody, especially when some person like me, known to the Govern ment, is willing to keep them, and hold himself responsible for their

('73', 186, 1, 3, 363380) I wonder if my presentation makes any appeal to you.
('73', 186, 1, 4, 363433) If it does I would urge you to make my way smooth, and restore Sardar Prithvi Singh to me.
('73', 186, 1, 5, 363524) I may tell you that my having interested myself in the discharge of political prisoners has brought me in touch with many revolutionaries.
('73', 186, 1, 6, 363663) I entertained high hopes of their conver sion, especially if I received hearty co operation from the authorities concerned.
('73', 186, 1, 7, 363787) I do not know exactly whom or which department, or which provincial government I should properly approach.
('73', 186, 1, 8, 363894) But I felt that aswe have come to know each other, and there is a friendly contact between us, I would approach you, the fountainhead.
('73', 186, 2, 9, 364029) May I expect an early reply?
('73', 186, 2, 10, 364058) I know how busy you are, but perhaps you realize the importance of the matter and will therefore forgive me for the trouble I am giving you.

('73', 189, 1, 4, 367965) I must send you a copy of what happened between Jinnah and me.
('73', 189, 1, 5, 368028) He is a very tough customer.
('73', 189, 1, 6, 368057) If the other members of the League are of the same type a settlement is an impossibility.
('73', 189, 1, 7, 368147) But there is a way out for a unilateral undertaking.
('73', 189, 1, 8, 368200) Settlements cannot be unilateral.

('73', 191, 3, 4, 370704) PYARELAL, I have your letter.
('73', 191, 3, 5, 370734) I do not find in it any contempt for me.
('73', 191, 3, 6, 370775) What you have done is scientific analysis.
('73', 191, 3, 7, 370818) I agree with many of the points.
('73', 191, 3, 8, 370851) I shall enclose with this the article I had written.
('73', 191, 3, 9, 370904) You can tear it up after having Devdas read it.

('73', 191, 3, 13, 371129) To my know ledge, such discussions have been beneficial so far.
('73', 191, 3, 14, 371193) I am not aware of the harm done.
('73', 191, 3, 15, 371226) There will be a great deal of dirty discus sions.
('73', 191, 3, 16, 371276) How can filth be removed unless it is brought out through discussions?
('73', 191, 3, 17, 371347) All this is unnecessary today.
('73', 191, 3, 18, 371378) I submitted to Mahadev, Raja, etc., because I am a little scared of them myself.
('73', 191, 3, 19, 371459) We shall see about it when I have acquired confidence in myself.
('73', 191, 3, 20, 371524) Does it not follow from your letter that it is not right that I should forbid others from taking the liberties I permit myself?
('73', 191, 3, 21, 371652) I am not perturbed.
('73', 191, 3, 22, 371672) I have almost regained my original calm.

('73', 191, 9, 32, 372094) Mahadev appears calm.
('73', 191, 9, 33, 372116) But if his calm is genuine, he will not be distressed by your letters.
('73', 191, 9, 34, 372187) I send him all your letters.

('73', 192, 1, 3, 372339) And why unfortunate?
('73', 192, 1, 4, 372360) Have you lost my love?
('73', 192, 1, 5, 372383) Have you lost Mahadevs love?
('73', 192, 1, 6, 372412) Why undeserving?
('73', 192, 1, 7, 372429) What have you done to make you undeserving?
('73', 192, 1, 8, 372473) You certainly are stupid because you could not understand some simple things about the world.
('73', 192, 1, 9, 372567) But it is I who make you stupid, What if I should be seeing my stupidity in you?
('73', 192, 1, 10, 372648) Now about the 9th night.
('73', 192, 1, 11, 372673) Why are you suffering so much?
('73', 192, 1, 12, 372704) Can it not be that my affliction is the result of my latent lust?
('73', 192, 1, 13, 372770) Maybe it is not.
('73', 192, 1, 14, 372787) Can it not be that it is the result of my delusions?
('73', 192, 1, 15, 372840) I have not claimed divinity.
('73', 192, 1, 16, 372869) If you can be in the wrong, why can I not be in the wrong too?
('73', 192, 1, 17, 372932) Both are a matter of imagination, are they not?
('73', 192, 1, 18, 372980) You have not experienced anything and I cannot know your heart.
('73', 192, 1, 19, 373044) God alone is the ruler of the hearts of both of us.
('73', 192, 1, 20, 373096) He alone knows our hearts.
('73', 192, 1, 21, 373123) That is why as your godfather I command you to regard your conduct as having been absolutely innocent and to forget your anguish.
('73', 192, 1, 22, 373253) My misconceptions are the cause of your anguish.

('73', 193, 10, 21, 375108) Deep within me I had felt that you yourself would not be able to stay away for three weeks.

('73', 194, 9, 28, 376527) But I think you were right in withholding the letters.
('73', 194, 9, 29, 376582) Only you can imagine Sushilas state of mind.

('73', 195, 3, 5, 377137) In expressing your sorrow, you use words which pierce me like arrows.
('73', 195, 3, 6, 377207) Have I ever worked for 12 hours in your presence?
('73', 195, 3, 7, 377257) Are you receiving Mahadevs letters now?
('73', 195, 3, 8, 377297) Did I write to you that Mahadev had resolved to stop writing to you?
('73', 195, 3, 9, 377366) In todays letter you have reached the limit of your stupidity.
('73', 195, 3, 10, 377429) Where is it laid down that if you see silver in a sea shell once you will do so every time.

('73', 195, 3, 12, 377631) Could it not be that I saw silver in a sea shell?
('73', 195, 3, 13, 377681) You will have to withdraw the adjective undeserving.
('73', 195, 3, 14, 377734) Would you be undeserving when I considered you so or would you believe it of yourself on your own?
('73', 195, 3, 15, 377833) Do you wish to abandon me altogether by saying that?
('73', 195, 3, 16, 377886) Now I am unable to bear your sadness because there is no cause for it at all.

('73', 197, 4, 5, 379544) There is no letter from you today.
('73', 197, 5, 6, 379579) I was perturbed by Sushilas letter of yesterday.
('73', 197, 5, 7, 379628) How can she be consoled?
('73', 197, 5, 8, 379653) She seems to be hurt all the more by my letters.
('73', 197, 5, 9, 379702) It seems that my letters, instead of healing her wounds, are keeping them raw.
('73', 197, 5, 10, 379781) Why can you not console her?
('73', 197, 5, 11, 379810) I am sure you understand my state of mind.
('73', 197, 5, 12, 379853) As for the night of the 9th I have explained that I fully agree with what Sushila says.
('73', 197, 5, 13, 379941) I have indeed said that her impression might not have been correct.
('73', 197, 5, 14, 380009) By the same token, I also believe that my impression might not have been correct either.
('73', 197, 5, 15, 380098) I am even going a step further.
('73', 197, 5, 16, 380130) Sushila is witness to her purity of mind.
('73', 197, 5, 17, 380172) I cannot even claim purity of mind.
('73', 197, 5, 18, 380208) I am willing to admit that I might have had a dirty mind.
('73', 197, 5, 19, 380266) Can it not be that my diseased mind might have aroused me and I might have seen the reflection of my own morbidity in that innocent girl and in her action?
('73', 197, 5, 20, 380422) Why should Sushila feel unhappy when all this is possible?
('73', 197, 5, 21, 380481) Why should she feel miserable on account of my morbidity, my delusion and my imperfection?
('73', 197, 5, 22, 380572) Why should Sushila go on feeling unhappy in spite of my acceptance of all these possibilities?
('73', 197, 5, 23, 380667) I am not accusing her of anything.
('73', 197, 5, 24, 380702) If you are convinced by my argument, try to pacify Sushila in your own words and in your own way.
('73', 197, 5, 25, 380800) I do not wish that she should be calm for my sake.
('73', 197, 5, 26, 380851) I can be calm only if her mind accepts that there is no reason at all to feel perturbed.
('73', 197, 5, 27, 380940) I have somehow started feeling that in all these incidents I alone have played the role of Satan and by imputing guilt to an innocent act have caused untold misery to Sushila, to Mahadev and even to you.
('73', 197, 5, 28, 381144) Thus, while on the one hand I am beginning to feel calm under the intoxication of work, on the other hand, whenever there is free time, I keep analysing the incidents of the day of the 14th of April and the night of the 9th.
('73', 197, 5, 29, 381369) I have found no clue so far.
('73', 197, 5, 30, 381398) I do not know if I shallfind it at all.
('73', 197, 5, 31, 381438) As Rajkumari says my faith in God is being tested.
('73', 197, 5, 32, 381489) If Sushila cannot be pacified at all, I can see that it will be a terrible thing for me.
('73', 197, 5, 33, 381578) But if she cannot be pacified what will you

('73', 199, 3, 4, 383239) DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB, I thank you for your exhaustive reply of the 24th instant.
('73', 199, 4, 5, 383317) Evidently my position has been misunderstood.
('73', 199, 4, 6, 383363) I do not wish to suggest that my judgment or that of the Congress is to be made sub servient to the opinion of the convicts, but before I could come to a final judgment, it would be necessary for me in the interest of the common cause itself to sound the prisoners mind.
('73', 199, 4, 7, 383634) If I had not, subject to confirmation after an examination of details, come to the preliminary conclusion that the solution suggested by the Bengal Government might be worthy of acceptance, I could not have thought of any interview with the prisoners.
('73', 199, 4, 8, 383886) My idea is, after deeper exami nation of the solution, to convince the prisoners of the desira bility of its acceptance.
('73', 199, 4, 9, 384007) Before, therefore, I can finally accept the solution suggested, I hold it to be necessary to take the prisoners into confi dence.
('73', 199, 4, 10, 384137) I hope that you will agree with this opinion, for the sake, as I have already said, of the common purpose, viz., to ensure peace so far as this ticklish question of prisoners release is concerned.
('73', 199, 4, 11, 384334) I take it that the question of detenus has been satisfactorily settled.
('73', 199, 4, 12, 384406) I would appreciate a line as to how the matter stands.
('73', 199, 5, 13, 384461) yours sincerely,

('73', 201, 9, 22, 386816) SEGAON, WARDHA, May 28, 1938 The fact that the first one thousand copies of this pamphlet have been sold out shows that what Dr. Zakir Husain and his committee have called Basic National Education is exciting fair interest in India and outside.
('73', 201, 9, 23, 387061) A more correct though much less attractive description would be Rural National Education through village handicrafts.
('73', 201, 9, 24, 387179) Rural excludes the so called higher or English education.National at present connotes truth and non violence.
('73', 201, 9, 25, 387289) And through village handicrafts means that the framers of the scheme expect the teachers to educate village children in their villages so as to draw out all their faculties through some selected village handicrafts in an atmosphere free from superimposed restrictions and interference.
('73', 201, 9, 26, 387575) Thus consi dered, the scheme is a revolution in the education of village children.
('73', 201, 9, 27, 387658) It is in no sense an importation from the West.

('73', 204, 3, 6, 390750) Today I am wearing the kuchchha 1 made from your khadi.
('73', 204, 3, 7, 390806) There is still room for improvement in your handwriting, though, of course, you have tried to write with greater care.

('73', 204, 6, 10, 390991) 244. LETTER TO PYARELAL
('73', 204, 7, 11, 391015) May 29, 1938
('73', 204, 8, 12, 391028) PYARELAL, Give the enclosed letter to Sushila if you think it proper.
('73', 204, 8, 13, 391098) It will give you an idea of my present state.
('73', 204, 8, 14, 391144) It seems by entering into Sushilas life I have embittered it at least for the time being.
('73', 204, 8, 15, 391234) How should I punish myself for it?
('73', 204, 8, 16, 391269) I have not shown your letter to Mahadev.
('73', 204, 8, 17, 391310) I have understood your point.
('73', 204, 8, 18, 391340) So far, I should say, I have not made any changes yet.
('73', 204, 8, 19, 391395) The conflict is still going on.
('73', 204, 8, 20, 391427) I like Mirabehns conclusion better than that of all of you.
('73', 204, 8, 21, 391487) That is exactly what Sushilas great anguish suggests.
('73', 204, 8, 22, 391541) I attributed guilt where there was none.
('73', 204, 8, 23, 391582) Does this not point to my own morbid state of mind?
('73', 204, 8, 24, 391634) Mirabehn is not even aware of that incident.
('73', 204, 8, 25, 391679) Yet she has warned me as gently as she could.
('73', 204, 8, 26, 391725) The direct implication of Sushilas anguish is this: What sort of a father are you that you saw guilt in an innocent girl? Even by deserting me she gives me the same warning.
('73', 204, 8, 27, 391899) She is of course taking the whole responsibility on herself.
('73', 204, 8, 28, 391960) But if I let her do it, would it not be the limit of my wicked ness?
('73', 204, 8, 29, 392029) If this conclusion is correct, would I not be doing penance by not taking service from any woman?
('73', 204, 8, 30, 392127) This question is before me in spite of myself.
('73', 204, 8, 31, 392174) I am perplexed.
('73', 204, 8, 32, 392190) I cannot see my way.
('73', 204, 8, 33, 392211) I cannot make up my mind.
('73', 204, 8, 34, 392237) Who can help me in this matter?
('73', 204, 8, 35, 392269) Hence I am praying to

('73', 205, 1, 3, 392409) I have taken note of your programme.
('73', 205, 1, 4, 392446) Even for the sakes of Prakash, Satya and Sushila, stay there as long as necessary.
('73', 205, 1, 5, 392529) Do not desert me altogether.
('73', 205, 1, 6, 392558) Bas remarks have scared me.
('73', 205, 1, 7, 392586) I have given vent to the fire that burns me.
('73', 205, 1, 8, 392631) However, do not think that I am in the least disturbed.
('73', 205, 1, 9, 392687) I continue working as much as I can.
('73', 205, 1, 10, 392724) All the things have been safely received.
('73', 205, 1, 11, 392766) What tyranny?
('73', 205, 1, 12, 392780) Why did you join in it?

('73', 205, 4, 17, 392983) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, May 29, 1938
('73', 205, 5, 18, 393014) SUSHILA,
('73', 205, 6, 19, 393023) I received your two letters together.
('73', 205, 6, 20, 393061) For three days I talked to you only through Pyarelal.
('73', 205, 6, 21, 393115) I do not know whether you have seen those letters or not.
('73', 205, 6, 22, 393173) Be that as it may.
('73', 205, 6, 23, 393192) I am picking up the courage to write to you today.
('73', 205, 6, 24, 393243) You have written: When I have the faith that you understand me and I too understand myself, the period of my separation will also end. When will you have the faith that I understand you?
('73', 205, 6, 25, 393430) When will you understand yourself?
('73', 205, 6, 26, 393465) When you understand yourself you will have attained to the farthest reaches of knowledge.
('73', 205, 6, 27, 393555) Then, instead of your coming to me, the whole world will come to you.
('73', 205, 6, 28, 393625) In short, I have lost you.
('73', 205, 6, 29, 393652) You are not an undeserving daughter.
('73', 205, 6, 30, 393689) What trouble have you given me?
('73', 205, 6, 31, 393721) I have not had such a thought even in my dreams.
('73', 205, 6, 32, 393770) I have already been proved an undeserving father.
('73', 205, 6, 33, 393820) Have I not troubled you enough?
('73', 205, 6, 34, 393852) Am I not the one who saw guilt in your innocent act?
('73', 205, 6, 35, 393905) I had lost you at that very moment.
('73', 205, 6, 36, 393941) I had even told you so that day.
('73', 205, 6, 37, 393974) I am reaping as I sowed.
('73', 205, 6, 38, 393999) You have returned everything.
('73', 205, 6, 39, 394029) Some of those things were meant solely for you.
('73', 205, 6, 40, 394077) The microscope, etc., were not bought for me.
('73', 205, 6, 41, 394123) They were bought only for you.
('73', 205, 6, 42, 394154) Permit me to return those things to you if you can accept them.

('73', 206, 1, 2, 394268) What else should I write?
('73', 206, 1, 3, 394294) I do not deserve even a letter from you.
('73', 206, 1, 4, 394335) I shall of course feel happy if you write.

('73', 206, 6, 12, 394603) The question of sending Lilavati arises only if Vijaya has to stay there long.

('73', 206, 10, 17, 394819) SEVAGRAM, WARDHA, May 30, 1938
('73', 206, 11, 18, 394850) PYARELAL, You will have received the letter I wrote you yesterday.
('73', 206, 11, 19, 394917) It seems I forgot to mention that I had not shown your letter to Mahadev.
('73', 206, 11, 20, 394991) I would wish this to be my last letter concerning the Sushila Mahadev episode.
('73', 206, 11, 21, 395070) So far as I am concerned, the conclusion I have come to from the facts that have come to me is final.
('73', 206, 11, 22, 395172) Sushilas firmness has opened my eyes.
('73', 206, 11, 23, 395210) I thrust my suspicion on Mahadev.
('73', 206, 11, 24, 395244) Only what Mahadev said to me on the 14th was correct.
('73', 206, 11, 25, 395298) Whatever he wrote and said since then has been done merely under my influence.
('73', 206, 11, 26, 395377) Hence, I must treat it as cancelled.
('73', 206, 11, 27, 395414) In the process, the innocence of both of them comes out clear before me.
('73', 206, 11, 28, 395487) My love was full of suspicion.
('73', 206, 11, 29, 395518) That is why I saw pure gold as brass.
('73', 206, 11, 30, 395556) I attributed my morbid tendencies to both of them.
('73', 206, 11, 31, 395607) It is my cussedness which is the cause of Sushilas tortured state of mind.
('73', 206, 11, 32, 395682) I have now got to look into the source of this cussedness.
('73', 206, 11, 33, 395741) The fact that Sushila has abandoned me because she feels that she is undeserving is due to her determination
('73', 206, 12, 34, 395850) 1 This is in Urdu.
('73', 207, 0, 1, 395869) 208 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 207, 1, 2, 395911) not to see any cussedness in me.
('73', 207, 1, 3, 395944) The result is of course good.
('73', 207, 1, 4, 395974) I do not consider myself worthy even to touch Sushila.
('73', 207, 1, 5, 396029) But would I thereby forget the anguish I have caused her?
('73', 207, 1, 6, 396087) How can I expiate for maligning Mahadev?
('73', 207, 1, 7, 396128) Did I not do the same with you in relation to Yoga?
('73', 207, 1, 8, 396180) Your firm stand conquered me.
('73', 207, 1, 9, 396210) I shall handle Mahadev.
('73', 207, 1, 10, 396234) He cannot abandon me at all.
('73', 207, 1, 11, 396263) When you could not abandon me, how can Mahadev do so?
('73', 207, 1, 12, 396317) You have been looking after Sushila.
('73', 207, 1, 13, 396354) Bring her back into line.
('73', 207, 1, 14, 396380) Once your affairs are settled there you have got to come here.
('73', 207, 1, 15, 396443) If you can give me a firm assurance about your coming, I can patiently wait.
('73', 207, 1, 16, 396520) Now about me.
('73', 207, 1, 17, 396534) If I have caused anguish to Sushila even unknowingly, where do I have the right to serve women or be served by them?
('73', 207, 1, 18, 396651) I cannot expiate for it by fasting.
('73', 207, 1, 19, 396687) I cannot do it by suffering in any other way.
('73', 207, 1, 20, 396733) My expiation can only be in one form and that to avoid the touch of women altogether and serve them from a distance in whatever way I can.
('73', 207, 1, 21, 396872) In no sense have I been a brahmachari of my definition.
('73', 207, 1, 22, 396928) I must make this known to my colleagues and do the necessary sadhana to approximate to my definition.
('73', 207, 1, 23, 397030) I do not know if my cussedness has gone that far.
('73', 207, 1, 24, 397080) I am trying to carry on an impartial search in that direction.
('73', 207, 1, 25, 397143) If it results in something, I shall inform you.
('73', 207, 1, 26, 397191) Neither you nor Sushila need be disturbed on reading this.
('73', 207, 1, 27, 397250) I am certainly not perturbed.
('73', 207, 1, 28, 397280) I am trying to understand myself in the light of the Gita.
('73', 207, 1, 29, 397339) I am not troubled by my cussedness.
('73', 207, 1, 30, 397375) I have not delibe rately cultivated it.
('73', 207, 1, 31, 397415) I was not aware of the stench I was carrying.
('73', 207, 1, 32, 397461) But when Sushilas fragrance entered my nostrils I thought it was a stench.
('73', 207, 1, 33, 397536) Such a feeling cannot develop in a day.
('73', 207, 1, 34, 397576) The root must be lying deep somewhere.
('73', 207, 1, 35, 397615) Who can unravel this tangle except God?
('73', 207, 1, 36, 397655) He alone can pull us out of trouble.
('73', 207, 1, 37, 397692) He will show me the way.
('73', 207, 1, 38, 397717) If Sushila can benefit by reading this letter, let her read it.
('73', 207, 1, 39, 397781) Otherwise there is no need at all to show it to her.
('73', 207, 1, 40, 397834) I have already written to Mahadev something to this effect in the morning.
('73', 207, 1, 41, 397909) I have said the same thing to him in a clear manner.
('73', 207, 1, 42, 397962) I do wish you would not feel upset.
('73', 207, 1, 43, 397998) Nothing is to be gained by feeling upset at this time of trouble.
('73', 207, 1, 44, 398064) I am well.

('73', 208, 3, 12, 398614) Are you not satisfied with whatever books we have?
('73', 208, 3, 13, 398665) Mahadev also has many books.

('73', 209, 12, 16, 400151) SUSHILA, I received your two letters together.
('73', 209, 12, 17, 400198) Now everything is changed, is it not?
('73', 209, 12, 18, 400236) My letters of yesterday and the day before will have made this clear.
('73', 209, 12, 19, 400306) Now I have more or less decided that with the exception of Ba I will not accept from any other woman any service involving physical contact.
('73', 209, 12, 20, 400447) After that, there is no question at all of an affectionate touch.
('73', 209, 12, 21, 400513) I have made another discovery.
('73', 209, 12, 22, 400544) In saying that I alone might touch women and that no one else might do so, I was guilty of a terrible errorand for how many years I persisted in the error!
('73', 209, 12, 23, 400700) I should have known that I could claim no scientific sanction for the experiment.
('73', 209, 12, 24, 400782) I was impelled solely by my terrible arrogance.
('73', 209, 12, 25, 400830) Among all my colleagues I considered only myself entitled to break the restrictions of brahmacharya.
('73', 209, 12, 26, 400931) As long as I am not willing to accept my colleagues touching women I have not the slightest right to touch a woman.
('73', 209, 12, 27, 401047) I hope to settle everything in a day or two.
('73', 210, 0, 1, 401092) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 211
('73', 210, 1, 2, 401142) only your firmness to thank for making me see my error.
('73', 210, 1, 3, 401198) In my viewthe restrictions I had laid down for you and Mahadev are no longer justified.
('73', 210, 1, 4, 401286) What qualifies me to lay down such restrictions?
('73', 210, 1, 5, 401335) When I admit that my accusing you was merely the reflection of my own failing, not yours or Mahadevs, where is the place for the restrictions set by me?
('73', 210, 1, 6, 401488) To the extent I am involved in this affair, I am the guilty person, not you, nor Mahadev.
('73', 210, 1, 7, 401578) I am writing all this dispa ssionately.
('73', 210, 1, 8, 401618) And what reward I gave you for your services!
('73', 210, 1, 9, 401664) Now for Pyarelal.
('73', 210, 1, 10, 401682) Mothers words were like nectar to me: You have already taken away Pyare.
('73', 210, 1, 11, 401755) Now you want to take away Sushila too? She was right.
('73', 210, 1, 12, 401809) I did not do you any good.
('73', 210, 1, 13, 401836) What good have I done to Pyarelal?
('73', 210, 1, 14, 401871) Pyarelals future would be the test whether my acts were good or evil.
('73', 210, 1, 15, 401941) As for you, I still consider you stupid.
('73', 210, 1, 16, 401982) You have worked for me like a benign spirit.
('73', 210, 1, 17, 402027) But for your resolute stand, my eyes would not have been opened.
('73', 210, 1, 18, 402092) I would have still been in the slumber of my illusions.
('73', 210, 1, 19, 402148) Mira behn has rightly said that I would have died repenting.
('73', 210, 1, 20, 402209) God has alerted me only through you.
('73', 210, 1, 21, 402246) Even though you came to me as a daughter, you have acted like a mother.
('73', 210, 1, 22, 402318) Not my merit but maybe yours will save your brother.
('73', 210, 1, 23, 402371) It is good that you are helping Brijkrishna.
('73', 210, 1, 24, 402416) My advice is that you should take the place for the hospital.
('73', 210, 1, 25, 402478) You must be fully recovered.
('73', 210, 1, 26, 402507) But who am I to guide you?
('73', 210, 1, 27, 402534) You have got a brother like Pyarelal.
('73', 210, 1, 28, 402572) He is with you.
('73', 210, 1, 29, 402588) Do only what he says.
('73', 210, 1, 30, 402610) After all, how can God give you up?
('73', 210, 1, 31, 402646) Who will be left for Him if He gives you up?
('73', 210, 1, 32, 402691) You will always prosper.
('73', 210, 1, 33, 402716) Do not worry about me.
('73', 210, 1, 34, 402739) I am well.

('73', 211, 3, 5, 403252) Our duty, as I understand it, is not to spend public funds and not to refuse the money which our relatives are willing to give us.
('73', 211, 3, 6, 403383) However, if they give unwillingly and because they cannot help it, that money should be refused.
('73', 211, 3, 7, 403480) You can judge for yourself in the present situation.
('73', 211, 3, 8, 403533) If you consider it your duty not to take anything from there, then your expenses on food, dress, some little postage, etc., should be met from here.
('73', 211, 3, 9, 403682) Now about books.
('73', 211, 3, 10, 403699) If it is a matter of a rupee or two, I do not find any harm in taking that money from here.
('73', 211, 3, 11, 403791) It would be desirable to consult me on such occasions.

('73', 212, 8, 16, 405025) 1 As you must have seen, such 2 of your objections as have force have been anticipated by the Working Committee.
('73', 212, 8, 17, 405138) But it seems to me that you are judging a big institution by the shortcomings of individual members.
('73', 212, 8, 18, 405239) The Congress has to be judged by its capacity of resistance to the foreign exploitation of the country.
('73', 212, 8, 19, 405343) In that test I hope that even the present ministry wont be found wanting.
('73', 212, 8, 20, 405417) I invite you to return to the Congress fold and fight impurity wherever you see it with all your might.

('73', 213, 2, 3, 405769) Not Revised June 2, 1938 I have been distressed since the 7th of April.
('73', 213, 2, 4, 405841) I had a dirty dream that night.
('73', 213, 2, 5, 405873) I did wake up before the crisis but I felt ashamed.
('73', 213, 2, 6, 405925) After the experience I hardly slept that night.
('73', 213, 2, 7, 405973) I was restless.
('73', 213, 2, 8, 405989) I walked about on the terrace and calmed myself a little.
('73', 213, 2, 9, 406047) I felt that I was not fit to accept service from Sushila and Prabhavati who slept close to my bed.
('73', 213, 2, 10, 406146) After the prayer, I first recounted to them what I had been through and then told them that I would not be taking service from them.
('73', 213, 2, 11, 406279) But both took this decision very badly.
('73', 213, 2, 12, 406319) Within twelve hours I reviewed my decision and continued to take service from them.
('73', 213, 2, 13, 406403) But my distress did not cease.
('73', 213, 2, 14, 406434) On the 14th I had another type of experience which increased my shame and added to my anguish.
('73', 213, 2, 15, 406529) I had not made any change in my outward behaviour.
('73', 213, 2, 16, 406580) But consciously or unconsciously, my mind was preparing itself.
('73', 213, 2, 17, 406644) While I was caught in that whirlpool, I had to meet Mr. Jinnah.
('73', 213, 2, 18, 406708) I thought it was my duty to write something for the occasion.
('73', 213, 2, 19, 406770) I wrote something and indicated my sense of shame in it.
('73', 213, 3, 20, 406827) I had lost my self confidence.
('73', 213, 3, 21, 406858) I had shamed my brahmacharya.
('73', 213, 3, 22, 406888) After a great deal of thought I have come to this decision.
('73', 213, 3, 23, 406948) For the time being, and so long as I am able to bear such physical contact with other people, I should not take any service from women which involves physical contact, unless it is absolutely unavoidable.
('73', 213, 3, 24, 407153) It is obvious that I must not touch them in jest or in affection.
('73', 213, 3, 25, 407219) This change is very important to me.
('73', 213, 3, 26, 407256) My whole life has been shaped in the belief that there is nothing wrong about innocent physical touch of women.
('73', 213, 3, 27, 407368) Before I took the vow of brahmacharya and after, I touched nume rous woman in a light hearted way or in affection, I have not expe rienced any adverse effect thereby and have not known any woman who may have been sensually aroused.
('73', 213, 3, 28, 407600) But a doubt arose after my experience of the 7th April.
('73', 213, 3, 29, 407656) Why have I not become free from passion in spite of my constant effortstowards brahmacharya?
('73', 213, 3, 30, 407749) Why have my thoughts and my mind not become purer and purer?
('73', 213, 3, 31, 407810) I can say that I have not felt myself free from carnal desire in India as much as I did in South Africa.
('73', 213, 3, 32, 407915) Could the contact with women have obstructed my path in some subtle way?
('73', 213, 3, 33, 407988) Who can answer that question?
('73', 213, 3, 34, 408018) The only solution is that unless God Himself answers it, I should try to shun all physical touch and

('73', 214, 1, 2, 408221) understand my own mind and conquer it.
('73', 214, 1, 3, 408260) Yesterday it became clear to me as day that it was very wrong of me to prevent my colleagues from taking the liberties which I myself have taken.
('73', 214, 1, 4, 408406) I still cannot understand how I allowed it to happen for so many years.
('73', 214, 1, 5, 408478) It seems to me that behind that restriction was my pride.
('73', 214, 1, 6, 408536) It was a failing.
('73', 214, 1, 7, 408554) I should not have undertaken the experiment if it was so terrible.
('73', 214, 1, 8, 408621) If it was worth undertaking, I should have encouraged all my colleagues to pursue it on my condition.
('73', 214, 1, 9, 408723) My experiment was a transgression of the limits prescribed by brahmacharya.
('73', 214, 1, 10, 408799) Only a sage like Shukadevji who was always pure in thought, speech and action would be entitled to exercise such freedom.
('73', 214, 1, 11, 408921) Such thinking led me to the above decision yesterday.
('73', 214, 1, 12, 408975) I feel that the bitter experiences of Dahyabhai and others at Sabarmati had my experiment at their root.
('73', 214, 1, 13, 409080) Who can say in how many cases my behaviour has led to wrong actions?
('73', 214, 1, 14, 409149) Only he who can observe complete brahmacharya can give complete training in non violence.
('73', 214, 1, 15, 409239) I am the self appointed leader of the path of non violence!
('73', 214, 1, 16, 409299) What wonder if my non violence is weak to the extent that I cannot pass the above test?
('73', 214, 1, 17, 409387) Even then, I shall continue my experiment in non violence so long as I feel convinced that even my imperfect brahmacharya has lent considerable support to non violence.
('73', 214, 1, 18, 409556) Otherwise too my behaviour would remain the same at least for the present.
('73', 214, 1, 19, 409631) Who can say where the future will lead me?
('73', 214, 1, 20, 409674) My strongest desire is to submit lovingly to God and let myself be driven whither He wills.
('73', 214, 1, 21, 409766) It was my clear duty to convey this much to my co workers.
('73', 214, 1, 22, 409825) I assume that any co worker who wishes will let me know his reactions and point out any error he may find in my thinking.

('73', 214, 4, 27, 410101) June 2, 1938
('73', 214, 5, 28, 410114) PYARELAL, Your letter was received late.
('73', 214, 5, 29, 410155) You had written Shegaon, which is not this Segaon.
('73', 214, 5, 30, 410206) The letter went to some other Shegaon.
('73', 214, 5, 31, 410245) If you write Wardha, I shall receive the letters regularly and intact.

('73', 215, 1, 2, 410390) You must have read my letter to Sushila which I wrote yesterday.
('73', 215, 1, 3, 410455) You will see that I have gone further ahead.
('73', 215, 1, 4, 410500) Now what have I got to draw out of Sushila?
('73', 215, 1, 5, 410544) The whole misunderstanding arose because of my misguided imagination and poor Sushila had to pass through an ordeal.
('73', 215, 1, 6, 410661) I am not now feeling sorry about it.
('73', 215, 1, 7, 410698) Whatever I did had been prompted by my love.
('73', 215, 1, 8, 410743) But according to my definition I proved to be a father with sensual tendencies.
('73', 215, 1, 9, 410823) How can such a father do justice even to his own children?
('73', 215, 1, 10, 410882) He would see his morbidities in others.
('73', 215, 1, 11, 410922) Where do you figure in this?
('73', 215, 1, 12, 410951) According to my analysis, this entire tragic episode is the result of my mistaken thinking.
('73', 215, 1, 13, 411043) Now my eyes have been opened and so things must calm down.
('73', 215, 1, 14, 411102) Does my diagnosis now sound complete?
('73', 215, 1, 15, 411140) The credit for everything goes to Sushilas firmness.
('73', 215, 1, 16, 411193) I have now understood about Sushila.
('73', 215, 1, 17, 411230) Now why should I worry?
('73', 215, 1, 18, 411254) Did my worry have behind it the fear that Sushila migh be harbouring a scorpion?
('73', 215, 1, 19, 411335) Sushila having shown her crystal purity, why should I worry about her?
('73', 215, 1, 20, 411406) She will shine wherever she settles.
('73', 215, 1, 21, 411443) I am enclosing a copy of the I note 1 have addressed to co workers.
('73', 215, 1, 22, 411511) I hope it will make everything clear.
('73', 215, 1, 23, 411549) Give this to Devdas to read.
('73', 215, 1, 24, 411578) What should I say about you?
('73', 215, 1, 25, 411607) My conclusion is clear.
('73', 215, 1, 26, 411631) If I have to lose you, the blame will be entirely on me.
('73', 215, 1, 27, 411688) I realize that in some matters I am slow witted.
('73', 215, 1, 28, 411737) I shall not go into a fresh analysis of myself If I lose you, I shall know myself as I really am.
('73', 215, 1, 29, 411835) If I can have you back with me in the natural course, I shall feel reassured thatI was not an absolutely undeserving co worker and father.
('73', 215, 1, 30, 411974) I have written to Sushila that if my meritorious acts do not save me, hers will certainly save her.
('73', 215, 1, 31, 412074) During this period of turmoil I have without a doubt obtained a jewel in the person of Sushila.
('73', 215, 1, 32, 412170) By saying this, I am not undeservedly praising her.
('73', 215, 1, 33, 412222) I am describing her as I see her at present.
('73', 215, 1, 34, 412267) Your letter of today confirms that thought.
('73', 215, 1, 35, 412311) Sushila writes that l should get my blood pressure taken twice a day and get my urine also examined twice a day.
('73', 215, 1, 36, 412424) That will be possible when you come here and attend to it.
('73', 215, 1, 37, 412483) I am myself not too keen about it.
('73', 215, 1, 38, 412518) All that Sushila wants you can carry out.

('73', 216, 3, 4, 412975) STUPID DAUGHTER SUSHILA, There is no letter from you.
('73', 216, 3, 5, 413029) Then why should I write?
('73', 216, 3, 6, 413054) But on second thoughts I decided to write.
('73', 216, 3, 7, 413097) My decision should not hurt you in the least.
('73', 216, 3, 8, 413143) Though stupid, you are intelligent enough to see that my decision is absolutely independent and inescapable.
('73', 216, 3, 9, 413252) How can I do what others could not do?
('73', 216, 3, 10, 413291) How was it I did not understand such a self evident thing, till today?
('73', 216, 3, 11, 413362) Why was I so silly?
('73', 216, 3, 12, 413382) And yet, I do not hesitate to call you stupid!

('73', 216, 8, 19, 413608) STUPID GIRL, Are you trying to prove your stupidity?
('73', 216, 8, 20, 413661) What did I know of your purity before Mahadev told me?
('73', 216, 8, 21, 413716) Since then I have been taking service from you.
('73', 216, 8, 22, 413764) If you too have experienced desire, it is as well.
('73', 216, 8, 23, 413815) For then we are both in the same plight and we both ought to be on our guard.
('73', 216, 8, 24, 413893) For me it is sufficient that I am on my guard.
('73', 216, 8, 25, 413940) The day I have to save myself from you, you will only see my dead body, you will not see me alive.
('73', 216, 8, 26, 414039) After my 69 years, the vikara 3 in you cannot affect me.
('73', 216, 8, 27, 414096) I burn with my own vikara.
('73', 216, 8, 28, 414123) Because of my vikara I regard myself unfit to take service from any woman.
('73', 216, 8, 29, 414198) For that reason, you are free to abandon me, but you are always telling me that you do not want to leave me under any circumstances, so I must accept your services in

('73', 218, 8, 14, 416233) PYARELAL, It was not difficult for me to read even those portions in your letter which were scored out.
('73', 218, 8, 15, 416337) You have harassed Sushila for no reason.
('73', 218, 8, 16, 416378) But she has already passed through the ordeal.
('73', 218, 8, 17, 416425) It was just as well that she was thus tested.
('73', 218, 8, 18, 416471) You too should stop lamenting.
('73', 218, 8, 19, 416502) My decision is based on entirely different grounds.
('73', 218, 8, 20, 416554) It has nothing to do with Miras argument.
('73', 218, 8, 21, 416596) It is not possible that my argument would have occurred to Mira.
('73', 218, 8, 22, 416661) If I see something wrong in a practice I have continued for forty years, shall I not say that there is the hand of God in it?
('73', 218, 8, 23, 416787) That was why I did not wait for your and Sushilas letters.
('73', 218, 8, 24, 416846) Now you can both see that even if it could be proved that Sushila was perhaps on the verge of succumbing to impure thoughts, my conclusion would remain unaltered.
('73', 218, 8, 25, 417009) So long as I am not prepared to allow others to do what I do myself, why should I do it?
('73', 218, 8, 26, 417098) This seems to me self evident.
('73', 218, 8, 27, 417129) I am now beginning to see this fault has a historical background.
('73', 218, 8, 28, 417195) After my decision all of us must feel at ease.
('73', 218, 8, 29, 417242) According to me everything has become clear.
('73', 218, 8, 30, 417287) I understand about the machines.
('73', 218, 8, 31, 417320) Only you can put them to use.
('73', 218, 8, 32, 417350) Right now I am not even in a position to tempt Sushila.
('73', 218, 8, 33, 417406) When she comes on her own I shall of course embrace her in spite of my having

('73', 219, 1, 9, 417916) And if Sushila wishes to come, her place will be higher than it was.

('73', 220, 8, 11, 419403) PYARELAL, I have read your letter to Mahadev.
('73', 220, 8, 12, 419449) Why so much lamentation now?
('73', 220, 8, 13, 419478) Having taken the decision I am now absolutely at peace.
('73', 220, 8, 14, 419534) Even Mahadev is calm as far as I can understand him.
('73', 220, 8, 15, 419587) l am not worried about Sushila either.
('73', 220, 8, 16, 419626) You are there.
('73', 220, 8, 17, 419641) That particular incident has nothing to do with my decision.
('73', 220, 8, 18, 419702) Although it provided the immediate pretext I have justified it independently of that incident.
('73', 220, 8, 19, 419797) Even if Mahadev and Sushila had been proved guilty instead of innocent, I would still consider my decision right.
('73', 220, 8, 20, 419911) Since they have been proved innocent my decision is of course correct.
('73', 220, 8, 21, 419982) My decision is not at all by way of expiation.
('73', 220, 8, 22, 420029) Whatever blame I am taking upon myself appears to me justified.
('73', 220, 8, 23, 420093) It may well not be so.
('73', 220, 8, 24, 420116) But even if the cause of the incidents of the 9th and the 14th is proved to be purely imaginary the legitimacy of my decision holds.
('73', 220, 8, 25, 420249) Very often, a decision becomes necessary to open our eyes.
('73', 220, 8, 26, 420308) Hence, let us stop lamenting.
('73', 220, 8, 27, 420338) Let us forget the past and look after the present.
('73', 220, 8, 28, 420389) Sushila therefore does not have to come to pacify me or to find her peace of mind.
('73', 220, 8, 29, 420472) I would certainly like to have Sushila by my side.
('73', 220, 8, 30, 420523) I would take service from her in so many ways.
('73', 220, 8, 31, 420570) But I would be afraid to let her come alone.

('73', 221, 6, 28, 421838) MUNNALAL, That my ideal is Shukadevji does not mean that I should like to have a face like his, to sleep, sit and eat like him and go to the Himalayas as he did.
('73', 221, 6, 29, 422000) It only means that I should like to cultivate brahmacharya like his.
('73', 221, 6, 30, 422069) And if you say that this cant be the ideal of one who wishes to live and serve in this world or that it cannot be attained by such a one, then brahmacharya like Shukadevjis is of little value.
('73', 221, 6, 31, 422262) A perfect brahmachari should remain unaffected by passion in any circumstances.
('73', 221, 6, 32, 422342) If you say that nobody has ever been, and nobody will ever be, able to cultivate such freedom from passion, then it means that we should abandon the struggle to cultivate brahmacharya.
('73', 221, 6, 33, 422527) If this is correct, then it follows that one can never cultivate perfect ahimsa.

('73', 222, 1, 3, 422818) Now that I know, the reason for alarm has disappeared.
('73', 222, 1, 4, 422873) Saying that I know does not mean, either, that physical contact with women was one of the causes or the only cause of my painful experience.
('73', 222, 1, 5, 423014) But this has become clear to me as day that I should not have done what I was not prepared to tolerate in others.
('73', 222, 1, 6, 423128) Now that I have given up the practice I shall discover whether it was physical contact with women that was obstructing my progress or whether there was some other cause.
('73', 222, 1, 7, 423298) Hence, for fully assessing the result of the experiment of refraining from physical contact with women, I must avoid such contact completely, for the present at any rate.
('73', 222, 1, 8, 423469) There is no question here of more or less contact.
('73', 222, 1, 9, 423520) I hope you will understand everything from this.

('73', 223, 2, 3, 423991) June 5, 1938
('73', 223, 3, 4, 424004) PYARELAL,
('73', 223, 4, 5, 424014) I hope that before you get this letter, both of you will have arrived here.
('73', 223, 4, 6, 424090) I had sent one telegram yesterday.
('73', 223, 4, 7, 424125) Today I am sending another.
('73', 223, 4, 8, 424153) I am sure you will not delay it.
('73', 223, 4, 9, 424186) Both of you have understood me wrong.
('73', 223, 4, 10, 424224) Nothing can be explained through letters.
('73', 223, 4, 11, 424266) Poor Durga knows nothing.
('73', 223, 4, 12, 424292) I do not think she has even the slightest suspicion.
('73', 223, 4, 13, 424345) And now what is there to discuss?
('73', 223, 4, 14, 424379) I have explained this in my letter of yesterday.
('73', 223, 4, 15, 424428) But I shall not write anything more.
('73', 223, 4, 16, 424465) I think I have not blundered.
('73', 223, 4, 17, 424495) But if you can prove that I have, do you think I shall take long to make amends?
('73', 223, 4, 18, 424576) You are unnecessarily putting the whole blame on Sushila.
('73', 223, 4, 19, 424634) I have not exonerated Mahadev independently.
('73', 223, 4, 20, 424679) What I am saying is that the scale by which I was measuring Mahadev was itselffaulty.
('73', 223, 4, 21, 424765) He is innocent from that point of view.
('73', 223, 4, 22, 424805) Right now, Mahadev has lost all capacity to decide whether or not he has committed a wrong.
('73', 223, 4, 23, 424897) My wretched suggestions are responsible for that.
('73', 223, 4, 24, 424947) What can poor Mahadev do?
('73', 223, 4, 25, 424973) Hence it is useless if he considers himself innocent and a thousand times more so if he considers himself guilty.
('73', 223, 4, 26, 425087) Sushilas case is different.
('73', 223, 4, 27, 425115) But todays letter puts her in Mahadevs position.
('73', 223, 4, 28, 425164) Both you and I are responsible for that.
('73', 223, 4, 29, 425205) And even there do I not take the lead?
('73', 223, 4, 30, 425244) Sushilas agony started with my intimation [of the happening] of the 14th.
('73', 223, 4, 31, 425318) But I have not taken my decision on that basis at all.
('73', 223, 4, 32, 425373) It does not involve any expiation.
('73', 223, 4, 33, 425408) It involves awareness on your part.
('73', 223, 4, 34, 425444) In your view it is utter ignorance.
('73', 223, 4, 35, 425480) If you prove that to me I shall swallow my pride.
('73', 223, 4, 36, 425530) I shall do what I did about Bardoli.
('73', 223, 4, 37, 425567) Hence, if both of you have not already started, do so after seeing this letter.

('73', 224, 2, 3, 425876) June 5, 1938
('73', 224, 3, 4, 425889) STUPID SUSHILA, How stupid you are!
('73', 224, 3, 5, 425925) Sitting there, you cry and make me cry!!!
('73', 224, 3, 6, 425967) You are unnecessarily taking the blame upon your self.
('73', 224, 3, 7, 426022) I have not given up taking service from Ba.
('73', 224, 3, 8, 426066) Other women feel a little unhappy, but they are cheerful.
('73', 224, 3, 9, 426124) They have also understood the point.
('73', 224, 3, 10, 426161) A. S. does feel miserable.
('73', 224, 3, 11, 426188) But I am also making her laugh quite a bit.
('73', 224, 3, 12, 426232) She is more stupid than you.
('73', 224, 3, 13, 426261) She too will calm down in a few days.
('73', 224, 3, 14, 426299) I hope that abiding by my order, both of you will have arrived here.
('73', 224, 3, 15, 426368) It is impossible to start today.
('73', 224, 3, 16, 426401) I am writing this letter so that the day does not pass without communication in case you are unable to leave.
('73', 224, 3, 17, 426511) Stop crying now.
('73', 224, 3, 18, 426528) I am eager to see you laugh.
('73', 224, 3, 19, 426557) You have committed no sin.

('73', 224, 7, 25, 426742) Unrevised SEGAON, WARDHA, June 5, 1938
('73', 224, 8, 26, 426781) MANILAL,
('73', 224, 9, 27, 426790) You will be leaving on Wednesday.
('73', 224, 9, 28, 426824) You came but I feel as if you had not come at all.
('73', 224, 9, 29, 426875) We had long enough conversations but I cant say that we talked at leisure.
('73', 224, 9, 30, 426950) But, then where do I have such a thing as leisure?
('73', 224, 9, 31, 427001) Whatever decision you take, do it calmly.
('73', 224, 9, 32, 427043) If you can keep [Indian] Opinion going, do so.
('73', 224, 9, 33, 427090) But remember the meaning of keeping it going, which I explained to you.
('73', 224, 9, 34, 427162) I would not consider it being kept going if it is done through advertisements.
('73', 224, 9, 35, 427241) This does not mean that you should now stop accepting advertisements.
('73', 224, 9, 36, 427311) But it would be pitiable for the journal to be kept going on advertisements.
('73', 224, 9, 37, 427388) Advertisements should be used for increasing the profits or for reducing the subscription rate.
('73', 224, 9, 38, 427484) In the case of pice newspapers a pice would not help to meet even the cost of the newsprint.
('73', 224, 9, 39, 427577) But because they get advertisements they are able to reach lakhs of readers by charging a nominal price.
('73', 224, 9, 40, 427682) If we accept the policy of taking in
('73', 225, 0, 1, 427719) 226 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 225, 1, 2, 427761) advertisements we can justify it only in this way.
('73', 225, 1, 3, 427812) The royal road for you, therefore, is that you should divide the total expenditure by the number of prospective subscribers and fix that figure as the subscription rate from the very beginning.
('73', 225, 1, 4, 428006) If you dont get subs cribers at that rate, then you should conclude that I. O. should be closed down.
('73', 225, 1, 5, 428108) The rest you know.
('73', 225, 1, 6, 428127) If you want to earn, settle down there.
('73', 225, 1, 7, 428167) I wont consider that objectionable.
('73', 225, 1, 8, 428203) If you wish to return to India, you should be content with whatever you get and decide to devote yourself to public service.
('73', 225, 1, 9, 428328) Please treat all this as no more than my advice and do what you yourself wish.
('73', 225, 2, 10, 428407) Have an amicable talk with Kallenbach.
('73', 225, 2, 11, 428446) Dont carry with you any worries about Sushila and the chil dren.
('73', 225, 2, 12, 428511) Vijayalakshmi and Nanabhai are there to look after them.
('73', 225, 2, 13, 428568) They will stay in Akola as long as they wish and then come here.
('73', 225, 2, 14, 428633) You should also know that what the children will acquire in India in the ordinary course from the surrounding atmosphere they cannot acquire in a foreign country, despite all our efforts.
('73', 225, 2, 15, 428821) You need not, therefore, worry about the childrens education either.
('73', 225, 2, 16, 428890) Sushila should come to Segaon early, because most probably I shall be in the Frontier Province in October.
('73', 225, 2, 17, 428997) And I cant say how long I shall be there.
('73', 225, 2, 18, 429039) My health is all right.
('73', 225, 2, 19, 429063) Pyarelal and Sushila are still in Delhi.
('73', 225, 2, 20, 429104) Maybe they will come after a few days.
('73', 225, 2, 21, 429143) Dont be lazy in writing letters.
('73', 225, 2, 22, 429176) If my message 1 has not been sent already, it will be enclosed with this.
('73', 225, 2, 23, 429250) Please give it to Ramdas.

('73', 227, 4, 16, 431568) How could I abandon you forever?
('73', 227, 4, 17, 431601) Why are you raising me so high?

('73', 227, 4, 19, 431709) My experience on the night of the 7th could not in any way have been influenced by the prurience of any of you.
('73', 227, 4, 20, 431821) As for the incident of the 14th, I find only my own sensuality reflected in it.
('73', 227, 4, 21, 431901) I shall explain it further when we meet.
('73', 227, 4, 22, 431942) Why do you presume the existence of something in your heart which was not there?
('73', 227, 4, 23, 432023) Your saying such a thing is a matter of shame for me.
('73', 227, 4, 24, 432077) I constantly see that I am sensual.

('73', 228, 2, 6, 433044) There are.
('73', 228, 2, 7, 433055) For when winding up Sabarmati Ashram I had said that we would from then on be a mobile Ashram and carry with us wherever we went Ashram life and Ashram rules.
('73', 228, 2, 8, 433214) Prayers, etc., thus stay as before as also the hour of rising.

('73', 228, 2, 10, 433401) We deliberately employ Harijan servants, because we want to serve the Harijans.
('73', 228, 2, 11, 433481) But though we employ them as servants we have to treat them as our brothers.

('73', 228, 6, 24, 434167) The thing has got to be taken up by the Congress.
('73', 228, 6, 25, 434217) What I said was that an accurate year book would supply a felt want.
('73', 228, 6, 26, 434286) It is not the work of any single individual, but you can make yourself responsible for it as editor if the Congress would entrust the work to you.

('73', 229, 6, 8, 434694) SEGAON, WARDHA, June 9, 1938
('73', 229, 7, 9, 434723) DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB, I am grateful for your letter of the 1st inst.
('73', 229, 7, 10, 434789) If you will please refer again to my letter of 27th ultimo, you will find that the sentence referring to deeper conviction has been wholly misunderstood.
('73', 229, 7, 11, 434943) You will see that it does not bear the meaning you have put upon it.
('73', 229, 7, 12, 435012) It is clear from the context that if, after deeper examination of the solution suggested by the Government, 1 I should find it acceptable, I would like to convince the prisoners of the desirability of their acceptance.
('73', 229, 7, 13, 435231) For deeper examination I must have more material, which is lacking and which I am seeking from you and other sources.
('73', 229, 7, 14, 435349) If, before I or Sarat Babu or Subhas Babu went to the prisoners, we all three came to the conclusion that the Governments was a sound offer, I for one should stand by it, even if I failed to get the prisoners acquiescence, unless they could convince me of the error of my judgment.
('73', 229, 7, 15, 435631) I must however inform you that my deeper study is shaking my belief in the workability of the solution offered by the Government.
('73', 229, 7, 16, 435761) Naturally I must weigh every solution in the scales I have set up for my guidance, and on the basis of which I submitted my propositions to you before leaving Calcutta.
('73', 229, 7, 17, 435930) I do not mind through what formula or through what machinery the object of securing the release of every prisoner inside of one year or thereabouts is attained.
('73', 229, 7, 18, 436091) With reference to the detenus and the State prisoners I remember the paragraph you refer to in your letter of 17th April.
('73', 229, 7, 19, 436213) I did not raise any objection to it, although I felt it to be a new intro duction, because I had hoped that an early solution of the prisoners question would be reached.
('73', 229, 7, 20, 436383) I venture to remind you that in the very

('73', 230, 1, 2, 436604) beginning of the conversations it was agreed that the detenus and the prisoners who were incarcerated without trial were to be separately considered from the convicted prisoners.
('73', 230, 1, 3, 436783) In my opinion it would be a grave injustice if the discharge of the detenus and State prisoners is to be made contingent upon an agreed solution of the question affecting convicted prisoners.
('73', 230, 1, 4, 436975) May I also remind you that the policy about detenus has been already made public by you?
('73', 230, 1, 5, 437064) It would be a thousand pities, therefore, if the release of detenus and State prisoners were delayed or indefinitely postponed because of the possible breakdown of the negotiations for the release of convicted prisoners.

('73', 230, 11, 19, 437902) Whether I want support or not is not the question.
('73', 230, 11, 20, 437953) I am trying to do without it but how can I say when I may have to have it?
('73', 230, 11, 21, 438028) I shall see about the massage.

('73', 231, 2, 5, 438419) 283. TALKS ON VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 1
('73', 231, 3, 6, 438456) [Before June 11, 1938] I had long been impressed with the necessity for a new departure as I knew the failure modern education had been through the numerous students who came to see me on my return from South Africa.
('73', 231, 3, 7, 438673) So I started with the introduction of training in handicrafts in the Ashram school.
('73', 231, 3, 8, 438757) In fact an extra emphasis was placed on manual training, with the result that the children soon got tired of the manual training and thought that they had been deprived of literary training.
('73', 231, 3, 9, 438948) There they were wrong, for even the little that they gained was more than children ordinarily get in the orthodox schools.
('73', 231, 3, 10, 439071) But that set me thinking, and I came to the conclusion that not vocation cum literary training, but literary training through vocational training was the thing.
('73', 231, 3, 11, 439232) Then vocational training would cease to be a drudgery and literary training would have a new content and new usefulness.
('73', 231, 3, 12, 439353) The acceptance of office by the Congress prompted me to place the thought before the nation, and I am glad that it was welcomed in many quarters.
('73', 231, 3, 13, 439499) English we decided to taboo, because we knew that most of the time of the children was taken up with memorizing English words and phrases, and even then they could not put in their own language what they had learnt, and could not properly follow what the teacher taught them.
('73', 231, 3, 14, 439775) On the other hand they forgot their own language by sheer neglect.
('73', 231, 3, 15, 439842) Education through vocational training seemed to be the only way to avoid both these evils.
('73', 231, 3, 16, 439933) I should make a start on the first day with finding out the calibre of the boyswhether they know any reading and writing, any geography, and then start with trying to add to their equipment through the introduction of the takli.
('73', 231, 3, 17, 440162) Now you might well ask me why I picked up the takli out of the many other existing handicrafts.
('73', 231, 3, 18, 440258) Because takli was one of the first crafts that we found out and which has subsisted through the ages.In the earliest ages all our cloth used to be made of takli yarn.
('73', 231, 4, 19, 440425) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Education through VocationA synthesis, Desai does not say when or where the talks were delivered

('73', 232, 1, 2, 440604) spinning wheel came later, and [as] the finest counts could not be produced on the spinning wheel, one had to go back to the takli.
('73', 232, 1, 3, 440736) In devising the takli mans inventive genius reached a height that had not been reached before.
('73', 232, 1, 4, 440831) The cunning of the fingers was put to the best possible use.
('73', 232, 1, 5, 440892) But as the takli was confined to the artisans who were never educated, it fell into disuse.
('73', 232, 1, 6, 440984) If we want to revive it today in all its glory, if we are to revive and reconstruct the village life, we must begin the education of children with the takli.
('73', 232, 1, 7, 441142) My next lesson would therefore be to teach the boys the place the takli used to occupy in our daily life.
('73', 232, 1, 8, 441248) Next I would take them into a little history and teach them how it declined.
('73', 232, 1, 9, 441325) Then would follow a brief course in Indian history, starting from the East Indian Company, or even earlier from the Muslim period, giving them a detailed account of the exploitation that was the stock in trade of the East India company, how by a systematic process our main handicraft was strangled and ultimately killed.
('73', 232, 1, 10, 441647) Next would follow a brief course in mechanicsconstruction of the takli.
('73', 232, 1, 11, 441719) It must have originally consisted of a small ball of clay or even wet flour dried on to a bamboo splinter running through its centre.
('73', 232, 1, 12, 441853) This has still survived in some parts of Bihar and Bengal.
('73', 232, 1, 13, 441912) Then a brick disc took the place of the clay ball and then in our times iron or steel and brass have taken the place of the brick disc and a steel wire the place of the splinter.
('73', 232, 1, 14, 442091) Even here one might expatiate with profit on the size of the disc and the wire, why it is of a particular size and why not more or less.
('73', 232, 1, 15, 442228) Next would follow a few lectures on cotton, its habitat, its varieties, the countries and the provinces of India where it is at present grown and so on.
('73', 232, 1, 16, 442381) Again some knowledge about its cultivation, the soil best suited for it, and so on.
('73', 232, 1, 17, 442465) That would make us launch into a little agriculture.
('73', 232, 1, 18, 442518) You will see that this takes a fund of assimilated knowledge on the part of the teacher before he can impart it to his pupils.
('73', 232, 1, 19, 442645) The whole of elementary arithmetic can be taught through the counting of yards of spinning, finding out the count of yarn, making up of hanks, getting it ready for the weaver, the number of cross threads in the warp to be put in for particular textures of cloth and so on.
('73', 232, 1, 20, 442918) Every process from the growing of cotton to the manufacture of the finished productcotton picking, ginning.
('73', 232, 1, 21, 443026) carding, spinning, sizing, weavingall would have their mechanics and history and mathematics correlated to them.
('73', 232, 1, 22, 443139) The principle idea is to impart the whole education of the body and the mind and the soul through the handicraft that is taught to thechildren.
('73', 232, 1, 23, 443283) You have to draw out all that is in the child through teaching all the processes of the handicraft, and all your lessons in history, geography, arithmetic will be related to the craft.
('73', 233, 0, 1, 443468) 234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 233, 1, 2, 443510) If such education is given, the direct result will be that it will be self supporting.
('73', 233, 1, 3, 443597) But the test of success is not its self supporting character, but that the whole man has been drawn out through the teaching of the handicraft in a scientific manner.
('73', 233, 1, 4, 443764) In fact I would reject a teacher who would promise to make it self supporting under any circumstances.
('73', 233, 1, 5, 443867) The self supporting part will be the logical corollary of the fact that the pupil has learnt the use of every one of his faculties.
('73', 233, 1, 6, 443999) If a boy who works at a handicraft for three hours a day will surely earn his keep, how much more a boy who adds to the work a development of his mind and soul !

('73', 233, 4, 10, 444240) JAMNALAL, I saw your letter 1 addressed to Mahadev.
('73', 233, 4, 11, 444292) I can understand your pain.
('73', 233, 4, 12, 444320) I hope the step I have taken will help to lighten your pain to some extent.
('73', 233, 4, 13, 444396) I have drafted a statement 2 in English for newspapers, but I have not as yet published it.
('73', 233, 4, 14, 444488) Your suggestion is certainly worth thinking over.
('73', 233, 4, 15, 444538) My temperament inclined me to another course.
('73', 233, 4, 16, 444584) I experience greater peace when I make such things public.
('73', 233, 4, 17, 444643) The fear mentioned in your letter is based on practical considerations.
('73', 233, 4, 18, 444715) I dont feel that I have lost the strength to stick to a step which I may have decided to take deliberately and as a matter of dharma.
('73', 233, 4, 19, 444849) However, I wont publish the statement in a hurry.
('73', 233, 4, 20, 444899) Even though I am putting it off, for non Gujarati readers there must be a statement in English similar to the one in Gujarati.
('73', 233, 4, 21, 445026) I got the news yesterday through Gordhandas about Savitri 3 having given birth to a son.
('73', 233, 4, 22, 445115) I am writing a few lines on a postcard to Lakshmanprasad 4. Blessings from, BAPU

('73', 233, 6, 25, 445258) It had referred to the adverse comments by some of the Ashram inmates on Gandhijis practice of resting his hands on shoulders of girls during his walks and his decision to give up the practice.
('73', 233, 6, 26, 445452) 2 Gandhiji had written an article on his decision for Harijan but it was never published as some of the Ashram inmates did not approve of making Gandhijis decision a public affair.

('73', 234, 2, 3, 445789) SEGAON, June 11, 1938
('73', 234, 3, 4, 445811) BALWANTSINHA, Your letter is extremely good.
('73', 234, 3, 5, 445856) It is pure.
('73', 234, 3, 6, 445868) Your doubts are pertinent, even your fear is relevant and your caution is quite welcome.
('73', 234, 3, 7, 445957) The vow 1 of 1935 was worded in English, I had not seen the Gujarati or the Hindi translation.
('73', 234, 3, 8, 446052) The purport of the original English is that I renounce the practice of placing my hands on the shoulders of women.
('73', 234, 3, 9, 446167) I did not feel then that there was anything wrong about it, nor do I now.
('73', 234, 3, 10, 446241) I gave up the practice only for the sake of public good.
('73', 234, 3, 11, 446298) My heart never took it to mean that I would never place my hand on the shoulder of any girl whatsoever.
('73', 234, 3, 12, 446402) I have no recollection of the particular girl with whom the practice was resumed in Segaon.
('73', 234, 3, 13, 446494) But I do recollect that I fully remembered my vow of 1935 when I placed my hand on her shoulder.
('73', 234, 3, 14, 446591) Possibly I could not resist her request, or may be I needed her support.
('73', 234, 3, 15, 446664) I cannot of course say that the support became necessary because of my weak state for had that been the case I could have had the support of some man so as to keep the vow inviolate.
('73', 234, 3, 16, 446847) But my vow never had such a wide meaning, at least for me.
('73', 234, 3, 17, 446906) From the very begining I have regarded Sushilabehn in the same way as Ba, as an exception.
('73', 234, 3, 18, 446997) My tender feelings are to account for that too.
('73', 234, 3, 19, 447045) I would like to give up physical contact even with these two if it were possible, but I have no desire to do so at the cost of the deep hurt which I would be causing them while my heart feels no sin in the contact of these two.
('73', 234, 3, 20, 447273) I took the decision only after much discussion with the girls here, after some laughter and some cajoling.
('73', 234, 3, 21, 447380) I have caused Ba much pain.
('73', 234, 3, 22, 447408) I still occasionally do, but I have no courage nor any desire to inflict any further pain on her.
('73', 234, 3, 23, 447506) Sushila has observed brahmacharya since childhood but her observance does not include the exclusion of innocent contact with men.
('73', 234, 3, 24, 447636) Pyarelal too is a brahmachari and one of the reasons for his joining me is that I do not advocate total avoidance of innocent contact between the two sexes and I have had a certain measure of success in this.
('73', 234, 3, 25, 447845) Once I intended to give up all personal services from Sushila but within twelve hours my soft heartedness had put an end to the intention.
('73', 234, 3, 26, 447984) I could not bear the tears of Sushila and the fainting away of Prabhavati.
('73', 234, 3, 27, 448059) I did not even want to.
('73', 234, 3, 28, 448083) It is these brothers and sisters that my decision has affected most and that is why I summoned them by wire.
('73', 234, 3, 29, 448192) I want their sincere

('73', 235, 1, 2, 448278) co operation in my present task.
('73', 235, 1, 3, 448311) Sushila has been present in the bathroom while I have bathed in the nude and in her absence Ba or Prabhavati or Lilavati have attended on me.
('73', 235, 1, 4, 448453) But I see nothing wrong in it.
('73', 235, 1, 5, 448484) It was necessary for someone to be there.
('73', 235, 1, 6, 448526) I could call a male co worker, too.
('73', 235, 1, 7, 448562) Pyarelal has been in attendance occasionally but I have never felt any embarrassment in being seen naked by a woman.
('73', 235, 1, 8, 448679) Still it would have to be a woman whose relations with me cannot come under any kind of suspicion.
('73', 235, 1, 9, 448778) Now for its implementation.
('73', 235, 1, 10, 448806) As soon as I put my decision into practice the discussions arose.
('73', 235, 1, 11, 448872) During the first round of discussions I started acting upon the decision the very next day though the step was to be taken only after 3 4 days.
('73', 235, 1, 12, 449016) The discussions are inevitable as long as my mastery over the passions is incomplete, perhaps they are even necessary.
('73', 235, 1, 13, 449135) Complete realization can be expressed best only through silence.
('73', 235, 1, 14, 449200) Speech can never fully express thought.
('73', 235, 1, 15, 449240) Ignorance denotes disorganization of thought which is why it needs the vehicle of speech.
('73', 235, 1, 16, 449330) Thus you may take it for certain that the very necessity of any explanations and persuasions on my part proves my imperfection or proneness to passsions.
('73', 235, 1, 17, 449484) My claim is and has ever been very small.
('73', 235, 1, 18, 449526) I am striving incessantly to have full control over my thoughts, i.e., to remain unaffected in every circumstance.
('73', 235, 1, 19, 449641) I am quite vigilant but the outcome lies with God which fact relieves me of worry.
('73', 235, 1, 20, 449724) Do write to me if some points has still not been covered or a new doubt arises.
('73', 235, 1, 21, 449804) I return your letter.

('73', 235, 4, 27, 450012) S. 2 is out of the picture.
('73', 235, 4, 28, 450040) She must be an exception being a doctor.
('73', 235, 4, 29, 450081) But your objection is sound in that even one woman vitiated the experiment.
('73', 235, 4, 30, 450157) I am struggling to exclude Ba, too.

('73', 235, 5, 33, 450292) 1 There is a reference in the text to the article not having gone to the press.
('73', 235, 5, 34, 450372) There is a similar reference in the Letter to Jamnalal Bajaj,11 6 1938, where Gandhiji says: I wont publish the statement in a hurry. This letter therefore could have been written about June 11. 2 Dr. Sushila Nayyar .

('73', 236, 1, 2, 450640) She wouldnt have what others cant.
('73', 236, 1, 3, 450675) Therefore she is training a male nurse.
('73', 236, 1, 4, 450715) You are again right in saying that even a womans proximity, speech, look, letter, etc., may work the evil as her touch might.
('73', 236, 1, 5, 450841) But I had to think of myself.
('73', 236, 1, 6, 450871) If I scented danger then I must put out my eyes, rather than have the animal in me be aroused.
('73', 236, 1, 7, 450966) You miss the crucial point.
('73', 236, 1, 8, 450994) It is not the woman who is to blame.
('73', 236, 1, 9, 451031) I am the culprit.
('73', 236, 1, 10, 451049) I must attain the required purity.
('73', 236, 1, 11, 451084) This experiment is but a way to be tried.
('73', 236, 1, 12, 451126) The article has not gone to the press.
('73', 236, 1, 13, 451165) It may never go though the prohibition is in force.
('73', 236, 1, 14, 451217) You will put yourself wholly in the wrong if you avoid me because of my decision.
('73', 236, 1, 15, 451299) If you were here I would convince you of the necessity of the decision, in spite of your finding flaws.

('73', 236, 5, 20, 451525) SUSHILA, I got your letter.
('73', 236, 5, 21, 451553) It is a great crime to feel unhappy over a step which one may have taken as a matter of dharma.
('73', 236, 5, 22, 451649) Therefore, forget the pain of separation.
('73', 236, 5, 23, 451691) It is your duty to stay in Akola and mine to keep you there as long as your presence there is necessary for service.
('73', 236, 5, 24, 451808) But if there is no such need, then stay in Akola long enough to satisfy Father and Mother and then come away here.
('73', 236, 5, 25, 451923) Take care of your health, as also of the childrens.

('73', 237, 2, 3, 452260) June 12, 1938 I hope, if I keep well, to join in the takli yajna daily.
('73', 237, 2, 4, 452332) This yajna is not obligatory for anyone but I think it essential for all inmates of the institution.
('73', 237, 2, 5, 452433) Takli yajna is a social and public yajna and the charkha has no place in it.
('73', 237, 2, 6, 452510) Takli teaches us silent service.
('73', 237, 2, 7, 452543) The millions can perform the yajna only through takli.
('73', 237, 2, 8, 452598) The noise of the spinning wheel is a distraction in the takli yajna.
('73', 237, 2, 9, 452667) So those who understand its worth may ply the takli exclusively.
('73', 237, 2, 10, 452732) The room we sit in is not arranged properly.
('73', 237, 2, 11, 452777) Quite a few things there are superfluous.
('73', 237, 2, 12, 452819) They should be removed after due exami nation.
('73', 237, 2, 13, 452866) The case lying near my seat is quite out of place.
('73', 237, 2, 14, 452917) Every thing can be accommodated on the box.
('73', 237, 2, 15, 452961) Our possessionss hould be the very minimum.
('73', 237, 2, 16, 453005) We should remember that non possession is one of the eleven vows.

('73', 237, 5, 19, 453166) DEAR PRITHVISINGH, I was delighted to have your letter and am happy to learn that you are quite comfortable there.
('73', 237, 5, 20, 453281) You have rightly asked me how a prisoner wishing to observe truth and non violence should behave in prison.
('73', 237, 5, 21, 453389) Your present beha viour is quite commendable, but let me put down here a few prin ciples: (1) A votary of truth and non violence may have nothing secret.
('73', 237, 5, 22, 453543) (2) He will observe all the jail regulations cheerfully.
('73', 237, 5, 23, 453600) (3) He may invite the attention of the authorities to such rules as may appear to him to be improper or hard.
('73', 237, 5, 24, 453710) (4) He has a right, and it may be even his duty, to disobey such rules as may offend his self respect.
('73', 237, 5, 25, 453813) But it is his duty first to make a representation to the authorities in respect of these rules, and he may
('73', 238, 0, 1, 453920) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 239
('73', 238, 1, 2, 453970) disobey them holding himself ready to suffer the consequences only after he has failed to obtain redress.
('73', 238, 1, 3, 454076) (5) Such a prisoner will never regard himself in any way superior to the rest, and will never agitate to secure facilities which are denied to others.
('73', 238, 1, 4, 454227) (6) Such a prisoner will regard the prison as a temple of freedom, and will therefore work for the development of his mind and his soul by serious study and thinking.
('73', 238, 1, 5, 454394) He will not waste a single minute.
('73', 238, 1, 6, 454429) (7) Such a prisoner will regard all jail labour as his own work and will perform it with the same devotion.
('73', 238, 1, 7, 454537) He will seize every opportunity to learn a new calling.
('73', 238, 1, 8, 454593) (8) Such a prisoner will always think of God, will never give himself up to despair, and will cheerfully put up with all hardships and sufferings.
('73', 238, 1, 9, 454740) What more can I say?
('73', 238, 1, 10, 454761) I know you will fill in the details.
('73', 238, 1, 11, 454798) I am in correspondence with the authorities regarding your release.
('73', 238, 1, 12, 454866) The result is in Gods hands.
('73', 238, 1, 13, 454895) Do write whenever you can.
('73', 238, 1, 14, 454922) I do get news about you from Shantilal and Jamnadas.
('73', 238, 1, 15, 454975) Your father has been informed.

('73', 239, 6, 13, 456314) MY DEAR IDIOT, I have never liked the idea of our women seeking foreign aid in their fight for freedom.
('73', 239, 6, 14, 456418) Hence I do not want the League 1 to inquire into the position or condition of Indias women.
('73', 239, 6, 15, 456510) This kind of propaganda turns their attention from themselves.
('73', 239, 6, 16, 456573) Their fight is not even against Indias men.
('73', 239, 6, 17, 456617) It is and must [be] among and against themselves.
('73', 239, 6, 18, 456667) I have never relished the fight put up for women at the Round Table Conference.
('73', 239, 6, 19, 456747) Such being my radical views you can understand my indifference to what the League does or does not do.
('73', 239, 6, 20, 456850) But if I have to examine their viewpoint, I refuse to read colour prejudice where there are other cogent reasons to justify a particular course of action.
('73', 239, 6, 21, 457005) I wonder if this is plain to you.
('73', 239, 6, 22, 457039) You may not agree just yet, though you will in the end.
('73', 239, 6, 23, 457095) For I am quite sure of my ground.
('73', 239, 6, 24, 457129) The women in S. A. rose at a bound by their own action.
('73', 239, 6, 25, 457185) And have [not] they, the village women, done likewise even here?
('73', 239, 6, 26, 457250) I had a long chat with Asha Lata about Parkinsons note.

('73', 240, 2, 3, 457544) [Before June 18, 1938]
('73', 240, 3, 4, 457567) KALIDAS NAG: Wherever I have been .
('73', 240, 3, 5, 457603) non violence is the question of questions.
('73', 240, 3, 6, 457646) But it is just a question or a matter of doubt .
('73', 240, 3, 7, 457695) has not Buddhism been responsible for widespread emasculation?
('73', 240, 3, 8, 457758) And whatever may be the potency of non violence, is it not impossible as a weapon of defence?
('73', 240, 3, 9, 457852) GANDHI: Do you want me to answer these questions or did you reply to them?
('73', 240, 4, 10, 457927) K.N. I have been replying to them after my own historical fashion, but I want you to answer them, for yours will be authentic answers.
('73', 240, 4, 11, 458062) G. Well, the answer is being given in India in actual practice.
('73', 240, 4, 12, 458126) It is no use citing the example of China and Japan.
('73', 240, 4, 13, 458178) India is the only place where if an answer must come can come.
('73', 240, 4, 14, 458241) Experience here is quite encouraging.
('73', 240, 4, 15, 458279) Intellectually of course even many people in the West have come to recognize the futility of violence and begun to ask if non violence may not after all be worth a trial.
('73', 240, 4, 16, 458450) Dr. Stanley Jones has sent me a copy of his recent article, Gandhian Solution of the Chinese Troubleand he has seriously discussed various forms of non co operation that may be successfully adopted.
('73', 240, 4, 17, 458649) There was time when Dr. Jones had not much belief in non co operation, but he now seriously suggests it as a non violent solution, and has pressed me to go to Europe to preach peace.
('73', 240, 4, 18, 458832) But so long as my mission in India remains unfulfilled, my visit to the West on a peace mission must be a vain effort.
('73', 240, 4, 19, 458951) Whilst it is true that non violence has made much head way in India, it is not of much value to an outsider and a critic at that.
('73', 240, 5, 20, 459081) K. N. What you say, Mahatmaji, is quite correct, viz., that the answer is being given, and if it is really given on such a scale as the size of our country it will be most effective.
('73', 240, 5, 21, 459264) For their acceptanceeven intellectualof non violence and non co operation is in a spirit of condescension.
('73', 240, 5, 22, 459371) G. It is impossible that a thing essentially of the soul can ever be imparted through the intellect.
('73', 240, 5, 23, 459472) It is just like trying to impart faith in God through the intellect.
('73', 240, 5, 24, 459541) It cannot be as it is essentially a matter of the heart.
('73', 240, 5, 25, 459598) Faith can be turned into knowledge by experience, and it can come only through the heart and not the intellect.
('73', 240, 5, 26, 459710) The intellect, if anything, acts as a barrier in matters of faith.

('73', 241, 1, 2, 460070) 294. A CRITICISM
('73', 241, 2, 3, 460087) A C. P. correspondent sends me a bitter letter criticizing the C. P. Ministry.
('73', 241, 2, 4, 460166) 1 I condense it below toning down the bitterest part: I have been wanting to write to you for some time but did not do so advisedly.
('73', 241, 2, 5, 460299) I do so now as one interested in the good government of my province which, I take it, is also your adopted home for the rest of your life.
('73', 241, 2, 6, 460438) We were led to believe that government by the representatives of the Congress would be so good as to escape calumny and be able to rule for all time merely by reason and by moral influence.
('73', 241, 2, 7, 460628) But the main purpose of the Congress Ministry appears to us to be.
('73', 241, 2, 8, 460695) (a) to worship your idol in public and break it in secret; (b)to worship the symbols of Imperialism in secret and denounce them in public; (c) to play the malefactor towards their opponents whom they cannot conquer by truthful and legitimate methods; (d) to carry on a brisk traffic in legislation and public offices.
('73', 241, 2, 9, 461013) The government of a people cannot be run, as the Congress Ministers in the C. P. seem to imagine, by the common argument of promised boons and by corrupting the electorate with hope.
('73', 241, 2, 10, 461196) During the past ten months your Ministers have left no stone unturned to shake the moral foundation of good government of this province.
('73', 241, 2, 11, 461333) The Ministry and its component parts are honey combed with intrigues and corruption.
('73', 241, 2, 12, 461418) To sum up my conclusion, which I wish to convey to you, is that the Congress Party might have been deemed capable of governing had they never assumed power and responsi bility.
('73', 241, 2, 13, 461595) Next to assumption of power is the responsibility of relinquishing it.
('73', 241, 2, 14, 461666) It is strange that your soul should not revolt against such a predatory Ministry for the creation of which the moral responsibility is entirely yours.
('73', 241, 2, 15, 461817) The Working Committee referred all the complaints against the Ministry to the Parliamentary Board which carried on an enquiry on the spot.
('73', 241, 2, 16, 461956) Its report 2 is public property.
('73', 241, 2, 17, 461989) The Congress is a wholly

('73', 241, 4, 19, 462060) 2 The Parliamentary Board which held a joint meeting with the C. P. Congress Legislature Party and the three Provincial Congress Committee presidents from the C. P. examined the various charges against the C. P. Ministry, including some of corruption.
('73', 241, 4, 20, 462312) In a statement Vallabhbhai Patel and Abul Kalam Azad declared that while the Committee found no evidence to substantiate the charges of corruption it found certain complaints not without justification.
('73', 241, 4, 21, 462514) For instance, raising from Rs. 15,000 to 1 lakh the limit of the Debt Conciliation Act and appointing underserving persons to professorships in the University.
('73', 241, 4, 22, 462674) They were glad to note among those concerned a readiness to admit mistakes and make amends and hoped that under promise of prompt rectification all public criticism will cease.

('73', 242, 1, 3, 462961) The Working Committee is its mouthpiece and has to work within the limits prescribed for it by the Congress Constitution.
('73', 242, 1, 4, 463083) It was open to the C. P. Congress representatives to demand resignation from the Ministers, but they did not.
('73', 242, 1, 5, 463193) On the contrary they wanted the present Ministers to compose their difference and carry on the Government.
('73', 242, 1, 6, 463300) The Parliamentary Board could not disregard the wishes of the representatives.
('73', 242, 1, 7, 463379) It had no power to do so.
('73', 242, 1, 8, 463405) But it did all it could to rid the Ministry of whatever short comings they had discovered.
('73', 242, 1, 9, 463496) The Ministers, it must be admitted, offered no opposition to whatever the Board wanted to do.
('73', 242, 1, 10, 463590) It now remains to be seen how the new arrangement works.
('73', 242, 1, 11, 463647) The point, however, that I wish to make is that the Working Committee does not hush up any evil that is found in the Congress organization.
('73', 242, 1, 12, 463787) It is not afraid to impose discipline which is readily obeyed in most cases.
('73', 242, 1, 13, 463864) I wholly endorse the correspondents proposition that the Congress can only rule by reason and moral influence.
('73', 242, 1, 14, 463975) He and critics like him may rest assured that the Congress will die a natural and deserved death if and when it substitutes reason and moral influence by goondaism.
('73', 242, 1, 15, 464140) One more point.
('73', 242, 1, 16, 464156) The Congress is composed of ordinary mortals.
('73', 242, 1, 17, 464202) They share the virtues and vices of the nation which they seek to represent.
('73', 242, 1, 18, 464279) But after all is said and done, it will not be denied that it is the oldest political organization in the country, it is the most representative, it has drawn to itself the best talent in the country, it has the highest amount of sacrifice to its credit.
('73', 242, 1, 19, 464534) Above all it is the one organization that has offered the greatest resistance to foreign rule and exploitation.
('73', 242, 1, 20, 464646) Whilst all honest criticism is to be welcomed, I would like to remind the correspondent and other critics that it is open to them to join the Congress and criticize it from within and to try to rid it of all the removable limitations they may discover in it.

('73', 242, 2, 22, 464924) 295. QUALIFICATIONS OF A PEACE BRIGADE
('73', 242, 3, 23, 464963) Some time ago I suggested 1 the formation of a Peace Brigade whose members would risk their lives in dealing with riots, especially communal.
('73', 242, 3, 24, 465105) The idea was that this Brigade should substitute the police

('73', 243, 0, 1, 465185) 244 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 243, 1, 2, 465227) and even the military.
('73', 243, 1, 3, 465250) This reads ambitious.
('73', 243, 1, 4, 465272) The achievement may prove impossible.
('73', 243, 1, 5, 465310) Yet, if the Congress is to succeed in its non violent struggle, it must develop the power to deal peacefully with such situations.
('73', 243, 1, 6, 465441) Communal riots are engineered by politically minded men.
('73', 243, 1, 7, 465498) Many of those who take part in them are under the influence of the latter.
('73', 243, 1, 8, 465573) Surely it should not be beyond the wit of Congressmen to devise a method or methods of avoiding ugly communal situations by peaceful means.
('73', 243, 1, 9, 465713) I say this irrespective of whether there is or there is not a communal pact.
('73', 243, 1, 10, 465790) It cannot be that any party seeks to force a pact by violent means.
('73', 243, 1, 11, 465858) Even if such a pact were a possibility, it would not be worth the paper on which it might be written.
('73', 243, 1, 12, 465960) For behind such a pact there will be no common understanding.
('73', 243, 1, 13, 466022) What is more, even after a pact is arrived at, it would be too much to expect that there would never be any communal riots.
('73', 243, 1, 14, 466146) Let us therefore see what qualifications a member of the contemplated Peace Brigade should possess.
('73', 243, 1, 15, 466246) (1) He or she must have a living faith in non violence.
('73', 243, 1, 16, 466302) This is impossible without a living faith in God.
('73', 243, 1, 17, 466352) A non violent man can do nothing save by the power and grace of God.
('73', 243, 1, 18, 466421) Without it he wont have the courage to die without anger, without fear and without retaliation.
('73', 243, 1, 19, 466517) Such courage comes from the belief that God sits in the hearts of all and that there should be no fear in the presence of God.
('73', 243, 1, 20, 466644) The knowledge of the omnipresence of God also means respect for the lives of even those who may be called opponents or goondas.
('73', 243, 1, 21, 466772) This contemplated intervention is a process of stilling the fury of man when the brute in him gets the mastery over him.
('73', 243, 1, 22, 466893) (2) This messenger of peace must have equal regard for all the principal religions of the earth.
('73', 243, 1, 23, 466990) Thus, if he is a Hindu, he will respect the other faiths current in India.
('73', 243, 1, 24, 467065) He must therefore possess a knowledge of the general principles of the different faiths professed in the country.
('73', 243, 1, 25, 467179) (3) Generally speaking this work of peace can only be done by local men in their own localities.
('73', 243, 1, 26, 467276) (4) The work can be done singly or in groups.
('73', 243, 1, 27, 467322) Therefore no one need wait for companions.
('73', 243, 1, 28, 467365) Nevertheless one would naturally seek companions in ones own locality and form a local brigade.
('73', 243, 1, 29, 467461) (5) This messenger of peace will cultivate through personal service contacts with the people in his locality or chosen circle, so that when he appears to deal with ugly situations, he does not descend upon the members of a riotous assembly as an utter stranger liable to be looked upon as a suspect or an unwelcome visitor.
('73', 244, 0, 1, 467785) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 245
('73', 244, 1, 2, 467835) (6) Needless to say, a peace bringer must have a character beyond reproach and must be known for his strict impartiality.
('73', 244, 1, 3, 467957) (7) Generally there are previous warnings of coming storms.
('73', 244, 1, 4, 468017) If these are known, the Peace Brigade will not wait till the conflagration breaks out but will try to handle the situation in anticipation.
('73', 244, 1, 5, 468157) (8) Whilst, if the movement spreads, it might be well if there are some whole time workers, it is not absolutely necessary that there should be.
('73', 244, 1, 6, 468302) The idea is to have as many good and true men and women as possible.
('73', 244, 1, 7, 468371) These can be had only if volunteers are drawn from those who are engaged in various walks of life but have leisure enough to cultivate friendly relations with the people living in their circle and otherwise possess the qualifications required of a member of the Peace Brigade.
('73', 244, 1, 8, 468648) (9) There should be a distinctive dress worn by the members of the contemplated Brigade so that in course of time they will be recognized without the slightest difficulty.
('73', 244, 1, 9, 468820) These are but general suggestions.
('73', 244, 1, 10, 468855) Each centre can work out its own constitution on the basis here suggested.
('73', 244, 1, 11, 468930) Lest false hopes may be raised, I must warn workers against entertaining the hope that I can play any active part in the formation of Peace Brigades.
('73', 244, 1, 12, 469080) I have not the health, energy or time for it.
('73', 244, 1, 13, 469126) I find it hard enough to cope with the tasks I dare not shirk.
('73', 244, 1, 14, 469189) I can only guide and make suggestions through corrspondence or these columns.
('73', 244, 1, 15, 469267) Therefore let those who appreciate the idea and feel they have the ability, take the initiative themselves.
('73', 244, 1, 16, 469375) I know that the proposed Brigade has great possibilities and that the idea behind it is quite capable of being worked out in practice.

('73', 246, 4, 5, 471660) I have not been able to write to you myself lately.
('73', 246, 4, 6, 471712) But what is the use of writing?
('73', 246, 4, 7, 471744) Do you ever stay at one place for any length of time?
('73', 246, 4, 8, 471798) You do not seem to have got the letters that I wrote to you at Sewan.

('73', 246, 4, 12, 472024) You worry too much.
('73', 246, 4, 13, 472044) But the Gita says that one should never worry.
('73', 246, 4, 14, 472091) One should endure everything.

('73', 249, 2, 3, 476072) WARDHA, June 21, 1938
('73', 249, 3, 4, 476094) To questions from the Frontier delegate regarding the non violence with special reference to foreign aggression, Mahatma Gandhi said that violence means a vicious circle of conquest and defeat.
('73', 249, 3, 5, 476288) True freedom is only possible through non violence and religion lives by non violence.
('73', 249, 4, 6, 476375) Mahatma Gandhi further said that agriculture is not a craft dependent on social and political condition.
('73', 249, 4, 7, 476480) Craft training is essential for Indian villages.
('73', 249, 4, 8, 476529) A compact and a small area without previous schools and with national work as the background, is necessary for introducing the Wardha scheme which is primarily rural, and for urban areas the same principle with the necessary modifications.

('73', 249, 7, 13, 476920) 2 It has caused me no disappointment.
('73', 249, 7, 14, 476958) On the contrary, where mutual confidence is estab lished, one is enabled to correct ones impressions based upon one sided evidence.
('73', 249, 7, 15, 477090) I know you are on the eve of your departure for England.
('73', 249, 7, 16, 477147) But if it is no undue tax on your time, and if my request is legitimate, I would like to have the evidence against Sardar Prithvi Singh, so that I may correct myself and know the step I should take.

('73', 250, 2, 3, 477972) SEGAON, WARDHA, June 22, 1938
('73', 250, 3, 4, 478002) CHHAGANLAL, I got your letter.
('73', 250, 3, 5, 478033) Replies tend to get delayed.
('73', 250, 3, 6, 478062) The reasons which you have mentioned also may be responsible for the scene on the 14th.
('73', 250, 3, 7, 478150) 1 But a great experiment can be carried out only by enlisting the support of those who are most likely to respond, and only thus can one discover truth.
('73', 250, 3, 8, 478303) I can now clearly see that it was a fundamental error on my part to have deliberately excluded other co workers from my experiment.
('73', 250, 3, 9, 478435) I should have tried to get a class of workers who would be able to carry on the experiment in accordance with conditions laid down by me.
('73', 250, 3, 10, 478573) My taking it upon myself, instead of finding such a class of workers, was the result of abysmal ignorance and certainly of conceit, too.
('73', 250, 3, 11, 478710) In consequence, while I would not tole rate even the most trivial departure from the conditions by my co workers.
('73', 250, 3, 12, 478824) I myself committed the most serious blunders.
('73', 250, 3, 13, 478870) This was the limit of intolerance.
('73', 250, 3, 14, 478905) The small mindedness implied in this attitude fills me with disgust for myself; but on the other hand the generosity dis played by all of you co workers delights me with its sweet fragrance.
('73', 250, 3, 15, 479096) This, in brief, is the truth.
('73', 250, 3, 16, 479126) The new experiment 2 started on the 2nd.
('73', 250, 3, 17, 479167) But it is only the beginning as yet.
('73', 250, 3, 18, 479204) The ship has set sail and is slowly leaving port.
('73', 250, 3, 19, 479254) It is not easy for one who has been used to sailing in one kind of weather continuously for 40 years to try to sail in weather of another kind.
('73', 250, 3, 20, 479398) Hence the slowness of speed.
('73', 250, 3, 21, 479427) I am not in a position to advise you much in regard to Gijubhai.
('73', 250, 3, 22, 479492) But I should certainly like you to consider one point.
('73', 250, 3, 23, 479547) Gijubhai is a devoted follower of the Montessori system.
('73', 250, 3, 24, 479604) I know its basic principle.
('73', 250, 3, 25, 479632) We do not even make an attempt to follow it here.
('73', 250, 3, 26, 479682) Narandas and you have understood the principles of the Wardha scheme and are convinced of the soundness of the scheme.
('73', 250, 3, 27, 479801) Probably Gijubhai will not be able to co operate with you.

('73', 251, 7, 9, 480412) MY DEAR IDIOT, My idea of boycott is that it can be a perfectly non violent measure.
('73', 251, 7, 10, 480497) When it is that, it becomes a duty.
('73', 251, 7, 11, 480533) Hence boycott of Japanese goods does become a duty for those who consider Japan to be wholly in the wrong.
('73', 251, 7, 12, 480640) And when it becomes a duty, it takes no account of consequences.
('73', 251, 7, 13, 480705) And duty has to be performed whether one has company or not.

('73', 251, 11, 19, 480933) [Before June 25, 1938]
('73', 251, 12, 20, 480956) Gandhiji explained to them how almost since the beginning of his public life in South Africa he had been closely associated with labour.
('73', 251, 12, 21, 481093) When he settled down to practise at the bar in South Africa he decided to give the whole of his spare time to work for the Indian settlers there, and the first man who came to him for assistance was an indentured labourer.
('73', 251, 12, 22, 481316) This case at once put him in touch with labour.
('73', 251, 12, 23, 481364) The labourers brought to him their troubles with their employers and also their personal and domestic worries, and that gave him a glimpse into their lives as nothing else could have done.
('73', 251, 12, 24, 481553) Non violence was the first thing he placed before them, and non

('73', 251, 13, 26, 481669) 2 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Notes.
('73', 251, 13, 27, 481708) A group of university graduates after undergoing training in the organization of labour had come to see Gandhiji.
('73', 252, 0, 1, 481822) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 253
('73', 252, 1, 2, 481872) violence was the only thing that they had been pledged to observe when, at a critical stage in the satyagraha campaign, nearly 60,000 labourers downed their tools and faced imprisonment.
('73', 252, 1, 3, 482059) They went through untold hardships, suffering, starvation, and some even died, but they adhered to non violence until the end.
('73', 252, 1, 4, 482186) Their condition was particularly difficult and in a sense worse than the workers here.
('73', 252, 1, 5, 482273) They were not free, but indentured, and they had to fight not only for justice from their employers but for the abolition of the opprobrious 3 tax which threatened them with extinction.
('73', 252, 1, 6, 482459) But non violence helped them to pull through.
('73', 252, 1, 7, 482505) His work in Champaran and Ahmedabad was recent history.
('73', 252, 1, 8, 482561) Regarding Champaran he said that the condition of the peasants there was almost the same as the indentured labourers, and that they had failed in their agitation for nearly half a century for there was no cohesive power of non violence to hold them together.
('73', 252, 1, 9, 482820) There had been several riots and their condition had grown worse every year.
('73', 252, 1, 10, 482897) But the first taste of non violence breathed new life into them, and at the end of a remarkably brief struggle they were emancipated.
('73', 252, 1, 11, 483031) Without that necessary discipline in non violence, they would have internecine strife and would never be ready to develop the strength that is needed to enable them to realize the power that they possess.
('73', 252, 1, 12, 483236) Organization, technical skill and everything else would follow the acceptance of the fundamental principle of non violence.
('73', 252, 1, 13, 483360) Class collaboration would also follow as a matter of course.
('73', 252, 1, 14, 483421) They are strong in numbers and yet they feel so dependent, so very much at the mercy of their employers.
('73', 252, 1, 15, 483526) That is because they do not know their own inherent strength.
('73', 252, 1, 16, 483588) Otherwise what is there to prevent them from pooling their own resources and dictating terms as employers do now.
('73', 252, 1, 17, 483702) The thing that they have to realize is that labour is as much capital as metal.
('73', 252, 1, 18, 483782) That realization can come only through acceptance of non violence.
('73', 252, 1, 19, 483849) But after that realization has come and they have come to their own, non violence does not become superfluous.
('73', 252, 1, 20, 483960) If they were to bid good bye to it, they would be as bad as capitalists and turn exploiters themselves.
('73', 252, 1, 21, 484064) The realizaton of their strength combined with adherence to non violence would enable them to co operate with capital and turn it to proper use.
('73', 252, 1, 22, 484209) Then they will not regard it as a conflicting interest, they will not regard the mill and the machinery as belonging to the exploiting agents and grinding them down, but as their own instruments of production, and will therefore protect them as well as they would their own property.
('73', 252, 1, 23, 484493) They will not steal time and turn out less work, but will put in the most they can.
('73', 252, 1, 24, 484577) In fact, capital and labour will be mutual trustees and both will be trustees of consumers.
('73', 252, 1, 25, 484669) The trusteeship theory is not unilateral and does not in the least imply

('73', 253, 1, 2, 484784) superiority of the turstee.
('73', 253, 1, 3, 484812) It is, as I have shown, a perfectly mutual affair, and each believes that his own interest is best safeguarded by safeguarding the interest of the other.
('73', 253, 1, 4, 484966) May you propitiate the gods and may the gods propitiate you, and may you reach the highest good by this mutual propitiation, says the Bhagavad Gita.
('73', 253, 1, 5, 485115) There is no separate species called gods in the universe, but all who have the power of production and will work for the community using that power are godslabourers no less than the capitalists.

('73', 255, 2, 3, 487359) DEAR KHWAJA SAHEB, I thank you for your letter of 18th June,1 as also for the letters from prisoners, dated 21st and 26th May respectively.
('73', 255, 2, 4, 487499) I wish the prisoners letters could have been sent to me earlier.
('73', 255, 2, 5, 487564) I am enclosing replies2 to them, which I hope will be sent to them without delay.
('73', 255, 2, 6, 487646) With regard to the prisoners, I had the benefit of a fairly long chat with Subhas Babu.
('73', 255, 2, 7, 487734) On his return he hopes to be able to see you, and then, if necessary, ask for permission to see the prisoners.
('73', 255, 2, 8, 487845) As, very properly, his acceptance and that of Sarat Babu is regarded necessary, it is as well that further negotiations are conducted by one of them.
('73', 255, 2, 9, 487995) Moreover this arrangement saves me another journey to Bengal.
('73', 255, 2, 10, 488057) I am sorry to inform you that my health has again become very uncertain owing to the heavy strain of work I have been recently undertaking.
('73', 255, 2, 11, 488197) Before the proposed scheme can be accepted by us three it is necessary that even following out the method of the Government scheme, the result should approximate to what I have submitted in my letter of 13th April last.
('73', 255, 2, 12, 488417) It I accepted anything less I would be guilty of a breach of faith with the prisoners to whom I gave an absolute assurance, often repeated, that, subject to their subscribing to non violence, I should strain every nerve to secure early discharge for every one of them.
('73', 255, 2, 13, 488686) I could, therefore, not be party to any scheme which does not imply such discharge of all prisoners.
('73', 255, 2, 14, 488787) The method adopted for achieving the end would then cause no difficulty.
('73', 255, 2, 15, 488860) I hope that when Subhas Babu meets you, it will be possible to reach a satisfactory solution.
('73', 255, 2, 16, 488954) If, at any time, you desire my presence, and if it is likely to facilitate matters, you will please not hesitate to drop me a line and, health permitting, I would gladly visit Bengal.

('73', 256, 9, 20, 490207) KANTI, I have been regretting having called Saraswati.
('73', 256, 9, 21, 490262) She has been miserable ever since you left.
('73', 256, 9, 22, 490306) She told Vasumati so the day before yesterday, and Vasumati told me.
('73', 256, 9, 23, 490375) I had a long talk with Saraswati.
('73', 256, 9, 24, 490409) She said: I cannot live without Kanti.
('73', 256, 9, 25, 490448) Send me to Bangalore. I got into a fluster.
('73', 256, 9, 26, 490492) I said: I certainly could not do that.
('73', 256, 9, 27, 490531) It would interfere with Kantis studies.
('73', 256, 9, 28, 490571) It would also spoil your life and your parents would not approve of it.
('73', 256, 9, 29, 490643) But I shall write to him.
('73', 256, 9, 30, 490669) You too may write. But she was not satisfied with that.
('73', 256, 9, 31, 490725) She told me this morning: Call Kanti.
('73', 256, 9, 32, 490763) Send him a telegram. I did not agree at first.
('73', 256, 9, 33, 490810) Then I felt that I should at least inform you and so sent you a telegram.
('73', 256, 9, 34, 490884) You must have received it.

('73', 257, 1, 6, 491343) It is my firm opinion that you should make it clear to her that you two cannot live together till you are married.
('73', 257, 1, 7, 491458) You certainly cannot abandon your studies and come away.
('73', 257, 1, 8, 491515) It is a different matter if you marry immediately and live together.
('73', 257, 1, 9, 491584) But none of her elders would be agreeable to that.
('73', 257, 1, 10, 491635) Your firmness is absolutely essential in the interest of Saraswatis progress.
('73', 257, 1, 11, 491713) Without that she would be completely ruined.

('73', 261, 1, 3, 495776) I have asked Vasumati and Sharda to keep her company.

('73', 261, 1, 5, 495869) But she wants you.
('73', 261, 1, 6, 495888) How can I give that?
('73', 261, 1, 7, 495909) You are safe because you can see your errors sooner or later.
('73', 261, 1, 8, 495971) Being at my wits end I have already sent a wire to Ramachandran.
('73', 261, 1, 9, 496036) I have asked him or Govindan to come over.
('73', 261, 1, 10, 496079) There has been no reply so far.
('73', 261, 1, 11, 496111) It was your duty to let me know what happened there.
('73', 261, 1, 12, 496164) Now my advice.
('73', 261, 1, 13, 496179) If you wish to save yourself and Saraswati you will have to be hard hearted.
('73', 261, 1, 14, 496256) You should plainly tell Saraswati that you will neither leave Bangalore nor permit her to come over there; that she will have to stay either at Segaon or at Trivandrum.
('73', 261, 1, 15, 496425) She will submit to you.
('73', 261, 1, 16, 496449) But she knows your weakness.
('73', 261, 1, 17, 496478) She is, of course, a child but you, too, have proved to be a child.
('73', 261, 1, 18, 496546) I had thought that you were mature and had ability to guide Saraswati.
('73', 261, 1, 19, 496617) But my judgment has proved to be wrong.
('73', 261, 1, 20, 496657) You seem to have become completely infatuated.
('73', 261, 1, 21, 496704) If you find it impossible to overcome the infatuation, then there is no other way for you except to get married.
('73', 261, 1, 22, 496817) But I would consider it an outrage for you to marry at present.
('73', 261, 1, 23, 496881) I would not give my consent to it.
('73', 261, 1, 24, 496916) But you do not need my consent.
('73', 261, 1, 25, 496948) I would regard it as your duty to do that without which you cannot live.
('73', 261, 1, 26, 497021) If I cannot give my consent to it because I dont like it, you should not feel unhappy.
('73', 261, 1, 27, 497108) Give up the idea of going to Nagpur.
('73', 261, 1, 28, 497145) Complete the course there.
('73', 261, 1, 29, 497172) Permit Amtul Salaam to talk.
('73', 261, 1, 30, 497201) It would be easy for me if you did so.
('73', 261, 1, 31, 497240) You should trust me.
('73', 261, 1, 32, 497261) I will not let Amtul Salaam violate propriety.
('73', 261, 1, 33, 497308) I will tell you an interesting thing that happened yesterday.
('73', 261, 1, 34, 497370) In the morning Saraswati came and asked me to send you a wire stating: I will be brave, etc.
('73', 261, 1, 35, 497463) I asked her to write down the telegram.
('73', 261, 1, 36, 497503) She, therefore, brought the enclosed.
('73', 261, 1, 37, 497541) I told her that it being Sunday I would send it today.
('73', 261, 1, 38, 497596) She was pleased.
('73', 261, 1, 39, 497613) Before two hours had passed she brought another telegram, also enclosed.
('73', 261, 1, 40, 497686) It was of course not sent.
('73', 261, 1, 41, 497713) This is the position.
('73', 261, 1, 42, 497735) Everything depends on you.
('73', 261, 1, 43, 497762) I wish to give you all possible help.
('73', 261, 1, 44, 497800) But all that should be within the limits of dharma.
('73', 261, 1, 45, 497852) Be mature and steady of mind.
('73', 261, 1, 46, 497882) At present you should live purely a students life.
('73', 261, 1, 47, 497933) Your life will be ruined if you yield to attachment.
('73', 261, 1, 48, 497986) May God show you the right.
('73', 261, 1, 49, 498014) I will not be in a hurry to send Saraswati to Trivandrum.

('73', 262, 9, 10, 498483) SUSHILA, I also have had a letter from Manilal.
('73', 262, 9, 11, 498531) By all means stay there as long as you wish.
('73', 262, 9, 12, 498576) Please remember that the law of life is that we should be governed by dharma rather than by our own desires.
('73', 262, 9, 13, 498685) Most often desire and duty, preyas and shreyas, are opposed to each other.
('73', 262, 9, 14, 498760) On such occasions we should follow shreyas.
('73', 262, 9, 15, 498804) This, of course, need not be applied to your wish to stay there.
('73', 262, 9, 16, 498869) It is all the same to me where you stay.
('73', 262, 9, 17, 498910) I should like you to stay wherever you would be more cheerful and keep good health.
('73', 262, 9, 18, 498994) From the point of view of service, perhaps it may even be your duty to stay there for some more time.

('73', 262, 9, 20, 499122) What arrangement have you made for her education?
('73', 262, 9, 21, 499172) Does Arun harass you much?
('73', 262, 9, 22, 499199) Is there any improvement in your health?
('73', 262, 9, 23, 499240) Why dont you write to Vasumati?
('73', 262, 9, 24, 499272) If you do not write even though you get time to write, how can you hope to be excused?

('73', 263, 1, 2, 499461) 324. LETTER TO GOSIBEHN CAPTAIN AND SISTERS
('73', 263, 2, 3, 499505) SEGAON, WARDHA, July 1, 1938 I thought I had never been one of the domestic circle and had never even tried to be one.
('73', 263, 2, 4, 499624) There has been an invisible spiritual bond between us derived from the common loyalty to Dadabhai.
('73', 263, 2, 5, 499723) I have regarded you as more than his descendants by blood.
('73', 263, 2, 6, 499782) You have believed in him and his mission.
('73', 263, 2, 7, 499824) His life was an inspiration to me when I was yet a boy.
('73', 263, 2, 8, 499880) I came under his influence before I had known any other Indian leader.
('73', 263, 2, 9, 499951) That influence has persisted.
('73', 263, 2, 10, 499981) Soon after I returned to India Perin entered my life and it was more than a joy to me to find Dadabhais granddaughter sharing my ideals.
('73', 263, 2, 11, 500118) This contact grew.
('73', 263, 2, 12, 500137) And it has become such that I instinctively feel and share the sorrows that overtake you when I come to know of them.
('73', 263, 2, 13, 500255) I never came near enough to Jalbhai to know him so well as you four sisters.
('73', 263, 2, 14, 500332) But I knew his great worth from many sources.
('73', 263, 2, 15, 500378) I knew above all his quiet services.
('73', 263, 2, 16, 500415) I realize therefore what a shock his death must be to you all.
('73', 263, 2, 17, 500478) This is to supplement my wire.
('73', 263, 2, 18, 500509) May the knowledge that I am a silent sharer in your grief lighten it somewhat.
('73', 263, 2, 19, 500588) With love to you all,

('73', 263, 6, 23, 500691) SEGAON, July 1, 1938
('73', 263, 7, 24, 500712) KANTI, I did not like your wire.
('73', 263, 7, 25, 500745) How can we stand between Saraswati and her parents?
('73', 263, 7, 26, 500797) How can we insist that she should never visit them at all?
('73', 263, 7, 27, 500856) But now your wire has no meaning.
('73', 263, 7, 28, 500890) The latest position is this.
('73', 263, 7, 29, 500919) I had a talk with her about a great many things.
('73', 263, 7, 30, 500968) I joked with her and I even assumed a stern tone, but Saraswati did not give up her obsti nacy.
('73', 263, 7, 31, 501064) Firmly she told me: Get me married. I said: I will never agree to that.
('73', 263, 7, 32, 501136) I cannot attend such a marriage nor can I give my blessings.
('73', 263, 7, 33, 501197) I do not approve of a girl of your age marrying.
('73', 263, 7, 34, 501246) I am a reformer and therefore cannot give my consent to a thing which I
('73', 264, 0, 1, 501318) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 265
('73', 264, 1, 2, 501368) dont approve of.
('73', 264, 1, 3, 501385) Moreover, I have every fear that Kantis studies will suffer as a result of the marriage, and that is another reason why I cannot give my consent.
('73', 264, 1, 4, 501531) But if your parents agree and Kanti also is willing, then I will not stand in your way and in that case you will not need my blessings. Saraswati was pleased and said at once: Then I am ready to go to Trivandrum.
('73', 264, 1, 5, 501744) You can arrange for that. I then asked: Shouldnt we first ascertain your parents and Kantis views? So she asked me to write immediately.
('73', 264, 1, 6, 501881) This conversation took place yesterday during my walk.
('73', 264, 1, 7, 501936) There was no question of writing a letter then.
('73', 264, 1, 8, 501984) In the morning I got your wire.
('73', 264, 1, 9, 502016) I showed it to her and asked her how she could go to Trivandrum now and also how the marriage could take place.
('73', 264, 1, 10, 502128) But she said: Kantibhai is definitely ready for marriage.
('73', 264, 1, 11, 502186) My parents also will not object.
('73', 264, 1, 12, 502219) You should write a letter and after getting his consent send me to Trivandrum. When during our talk yesterday I agreed not to oppose the marriage to the extent of preventing it, she agreed even to study during the time she had to stay here.
('73', 264, 1, 13, 502460) She has started learning English from Mr. Kallen bachs niece.
('73', 264, 1, 14, 502522) Today she must have started even the Hindi lessons.
('73', 264, 1, 15, 502574) This is the position.
('73', 264, 1, 16, 502596) The idea of Nagpur is absolutely useless.
('73', 264, 1, 17, 502638) Mahadev has already written to you about that.
('73', 264, 1, 18, 502685) I also have already given you my opinion.
('73', 264, 1, 19, 502727) I had given my consent only with the hope that your relationship would be an ideal one.
('73', 264, 1, 20, 502815) At the moment, I do not see any sign of that hope being realized.
('73', 264, 1, 21, 502881) I said to Saraswati: Kanti wants that you should be treated as Kanam. She vehemently protested: I am not Kanam.
('73', 264, 1, 22, 502993) I know my interests.
('73', 264, 1, 23, 503014) I will not stay here without Kantibhai.
('73', 264, 1, 24, 503054) Please call him for fifteen days. I cannot make Saraswati obey my orders as you think.
('73', 264, 1, 25, 503141) I ought not to do that either.
('73', 264, 1, 26, 503172) The key is solely in your hands.
('73', 264, 1, 27, 503205) My advice is that you should let Saraswati go to Trivandrum, should flatly refuse to marry just now and should not go to Trivandrum yourself.
('73', 264, 1, 28, 503347) You should sacrifice everything else for the sake of your studies.
('73', 264, 1, 29, 503414) You should write all this to Saraswati very frankly.
('73', 264, 1, 30, 503467) You ought not to leave your studies and come here.
('73', 264, 1, 31, 503518) But this is, of course, my opinion.
('73', 264, 1, 32, 503554) If it does not appeal to you and if you are ready to marry, you may by all means do so.
('73', 264, 1, 33, 503642) You need not bother if I do not think that it will be for your good.
('73', 264, 1, 34, 503711) Who can foresee the future?
('73', 264, 1, 35, 503739) My fear may be unjustified and my reasoning may be wrong.
('73', 264, 1, 36, 503797) You know best what is good for you.
('73', 264, 1, 37, 503833) You should, therefore, decide as you think best without taking into consideration my opinion and inform me accordingly.
('73', 264, 1, 38, 503953) In the mean time, I will do whatever may be
('73', 265, 0, 1, 503997) 266 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 265, 1, 2, 504039) necessary to humour Saraswati.
('73', 265, 1, 3, 504070) Yesterday I spared four hours for that girl.
('73', 265, 1, 4, 504115) Vasumati is devoting a good deal of her time to her, but she frankly confesses: The task is beyond me.
('73', 265, 1, 5, 504218) How would a girl who does not listen to you listen to me? Over and above this Kanu also gives some time to her.
('73', 265, 1, 6, 504330) Lilavati, Sharda, etc., try their level best to make friends with her.
('73', 265, 1, 7, 504401) But she is not easy to make friends with.
('73', 265, 1, 8, 504443) It seems she feels somewhat at home with Vasumati, though.
('73', 265, 1, 9, 504502) I still think that Amtul Salaam might be able to influence her.
('73', 265, 1, 10, 504566) Now do as God prompts you and write to me.

('73', 265, 7, 15, 504748) KAKA, I got your letter.
('73', 265, 7, 16, 504773) I have already read through twice the letter to Maulana Saheb.
('73', 265, 7, 17, 504836) I do not reject it but may have to redraft it completely.
('73', 265, 7, 18, 504894) Hence the delay.
('73', 265, 7, 19, 504911) I will redraft it as early as I can.
('73', 265, 7, 20, 504948) I understood Ramdevjis letter.
('73', 265, 7, 21, 504979) If you come some day, you can persuade Mirabehn yourself.
('73', 265, 7, 22, 505037) My persuading her will mean ordering her, which will not be right.

('73', 265, 11, 26, 505197) SEGAON, WARDHA, July 1, 1938
('73', 265, 12, 27, 505226) CHHAGANLAL, Your letter was excellent, because it was so frank.
('73', 265, 12, 28, 505290) There was no reason at all for you to apologize for it.
('73', 265, 12, 29, 505346) I fully remember the dis cussion at the Sabarmati Ashram.
('73', 265, 12, 30, 505404) But my impression is the opposite of yours.
('73', 265, 12, 31, 505448) I think also that the subject was discussed on two separate occasions.
('73', 265, 12, 32, 505519) I have a faint impression that at the end of the discussion
('73', 266, 0, 1, 505579) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 267
('73', 266, 1, 2, 505629) on the first occasion some decision was arrived at regarding my practice of walking with my hand on a girls shoulder.
('73', 266, 1, 3, 505747) Kaka was not present at that discussion.
('73', 266, 1, 4, 505788) When he came to know about it, he raised the subject again, for he approved of the principle behind my practice.
('73', 266, 1, 5, 505901) At the end of the second discussion, my memory is that I had decided to maintain the status quo.
('73', 266, 1, 6, 505998) Be that as it may, the main point is that I do not think I have failed to do what I had promised to do.
('73', 266, 1, 7, 506102) As regards the Wardha decision, you will see if you read Harijan1 that the girls, while going in procession from Maganwadi to Mahilashram and from Mahilashram to Maganwadi, used to call at my hut and take me out with them.
('73', 266, 1, 8, 506325) I walked with my hands on their shoulders by turns.
('73', 266, 1, 9, 506377) This was observed by some people and became the subject of comment.
('73', 266, 1, 10, 506445) I myself raised the matter for discussion and published the decision at which I finally arrived.
('73', 266, 1, 11, 506542) It was not in my mind at all that I would never place my hands even on the shoulders of girls who live with me, for after writing that article I continued to use Manu and other girls as my walking sticks.
('73', 266, 1, 12, 506747) But that procession stopped, and the practice has not been revived and will not be revived.
('73', 266, 1, 13, 506839) The reason for stopping it had nothing to do with my vow of brahmacharya.
('73', 266, 1, 14, 506913) The only consideration was the good of society.
('73', 266, 1, 15, 506961) In this instance, too, there is no question of my having failed to do what I had declared I would do.
('73', 266, 1, 16, 507063) If I had made such a declaration and then failed to abide by it, knowing full well that I was doing so, I would be pained and feel humiliated in my own eyes.
('73', 266, 1, 17, 507221) It would give me no pleasure to know that I had weakened in my determination to keep a vow.
('73', 266, 1, 18, 507313) Yes, there may be self deception sometimes; as, for instance, when I decided to drink goats milk because my vow forbade me to use cows or buffalos milk, or when I compromised by counting several vegetables as one item in observing the vow of not consuming more than five items at any one meal.
('73', 266, 1, 19, 507607) This is a painful memory for me.
('73', 266, 1, 20, 507640) Even so, I have convinced myself that I have not violated the letter of my pledges and exercise the utmost strictness in observing a vow.
('73', 266, 1, 21, 507778) I have no comment to make about Thakkar Bapa having been pained.
('73', 266, 1, 22, 507843) You had no reply to give to the criticism of that muni of Kutch, for you had before you two instances of what you regard to be violation of pledges; you should, therefore, bear that criticism without resentment.
('73', 266, 1, 23, 508055) Your only reply can be: Even we, who live with him, are puzzled by some of his actions.
('73', 266, 1, 24, 508143) But we think we have lost nothing by

('73', 267, 0, 1, 508202) 268 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 267, 1, 2, 508244) our association with him, and so we cling to him.
('73', 267, 1, 3, 508294) I will ask him about the comparision which you have made. If you gave this reply, it was correct.
('73', 267, 1, 4, 508392) If you kept quiet, that also was right.
('73', 267, 1, 5, 508432) In any case, you can always give this reply: He has always touched girls with a pure feeling and never with a gross purpose.
('73', 267, 1, 6, 508557) But a doubt having occurred whether, unknown to him, there might not be an impure feeling in his heart, he has temporarily given up the practice to end that doubt. Personally, I cannot compare the munis conduct with mine.
('73', 267, 1, 7, 508779) According to me, there is a serious error in it.
('73', 267, 1, 8, 508828) If, however, his own conscience feels nothing wrong in his practice, he should continue it no matter what I do.
('73', 267, 1, 9, 508940) This is so deep a matter that blind imitation of one another is likely to land one into serious error.
('73', 267, 1, 10, 509043) Everybody, therefore, should cultivate a vigilant conscience and be guided by it, with God as witness.
('73', 267, 1, 11, 509146) I am trying to issue a statement explaining my position.
('73', 267, 1, 12, 509203) I wish to satisfy as many co workers as I can.
('73', 267, 1, 13, 509250) Let us see if I succeed.
('73', 267, 1, 14, 509275) You do not seem to have understood the meaning of the remark the ship is still in port1. It only means that, though the experiment is going on, while discussion about it is still continuing it cannot be said that it is being carried on in thought, speech and action.
('73', 267, 1, 15, 509542) I can observe its effects only if I go on with it silently.
('73', 267, 1, 16, 509602) Just now, therefore, it is being followed only in action.
('73', 267, 1, 17, 509660) As for thought and speech, we joke about the matter daily.
('73', 267, 1, 18, 509719) This is enough for today.
('73', 267, 1, 19, 509745) I can say nothing about the Frontier Province just now.

('73', 268, 5, 11, 510628) July 2, 1938
('73', 268, 6, 12, 510641) KANTI Saraswati has just showed me your letter.
('73', 268, 6, 13, 510689) One moment you are angry and the next moment you are pleased.
('73', 268, 6, 14, 510751) How can anybody, therefore, feel happy when you are pleased or unhappy when you are angry?
('73', 268, 6, 15, 510842) Have I ever considered your attachment to Saraswati wrong?
('73', 268, 6, 16, 510901) I felt unhappy because I did not see what I had expected of you.
('73', 268, 6, 17, 510966) But what does it matter?
('73', 268, 6, 18, 510991) It would be best that you appear to me exactly as you are.
('73', 268, 6, 19, 511050) Saraswati has been jubilant since the day before yesterday, for she has concluded from your letter that she will be marrying you in a few days.
('73', 268, 6, 20, 511194) She was afraid that I would oppose the marriage.
('73', 268, 6, 21, 511243) She was in high spirits the whole of yesterday.
('73', 268, 6, 22, 511291) She showed me your today's letter to her.
('73', 268, 6, 23, 511333) I feel afraid now that there will be some hitch again.
('73', 268, 6, 24, 511388) I strain myself on her account.
('73', 268, 6, 25, 511420) I give her as much time as I can and do my best to cheer her.
('73', 268, 6, 26, 511482) But I see that whenever her mind gets fixed upon something it is impossible to do that.
('73', 268, 6, 27, 511570) Otherwise I very much like her innocence, her simplicity and her childlike nature.
('73', 268, 6, 28, 511653) I will look after her as long as she stays here.
('73', 268, 6, 29, 511702) I will watch what effect your letter has on her.
('73', 268, 6, 30, 511751) She has not yet talked to me.
('73', 268, 6, 31, 511781) I did ask her of course.
('73', 268, 6, 32, 511806) You are right when you say that wherever my conclusions are based on incomplete information, they are faulty.
('73', 268, 6, 33, 511916) They must be so.
('73', 268, 6, 34, 511933) It may be called a virtue in a votary of truth, for his conclusions ought to be strictly based on the facts in his possession.
('73', 268, 6, 35, 512060) He should not be led astray by any consideration of self interest and should preserve an objective attitude.
('73', 268, 6, 36, 512169) I should be happy if my condition is such as you have described it.
('73', 268, 6, 37, 512237) That is what it should be.

('73', 269, 6, 10, 512736) But did you realize or not that there was love behind my anger?
('73', 269, 6, 11, 512800) I could not bear even that mistake on your part which I knew you would make.
('73', 269, 6, 12, 512877) It is a good sign.
('73', 269, 6, 13, 512896) I want to see you perfect.
('73', 269, 6, 14, 512923) If you have patience, you will certainly become so.

('73', 271, 3, 4, 514995) KANTI, You must have received my letter of yesterday.
('73', 271, 3, 5, 515049) You are very cruel indeed, and also childish.
('73', 271, 3, 6, 515095) You may write as rude letters as you can but they will not make me angry.
('73', 271, 3, 7, 515169) But why do you get so angry?
('73', 271, 3, 8, 515198) You are wise and are capable of self sacrifice, but it pains me to know that you are eaten up by anger.
('73', 271, 3, 9, 515302) The knowledge that you are harming yourself does wring my heart.
('73', 271, 3, 10, 515367) I feel afraid of you.
('73', 271, 3, 11, 515389) It does not do you credit that I should weigh my words when writing to you.
('73', 271, 3, 12, 515465) Your letter to Saraswati was bad.
('73', 271, 3, 13, 515499) She has been terribly upset.
('73', 271, 3, 14, 515528) Here is her letter to me.
('73', 271, 3, 15, 515554) Why pit an army against a goat?
('73', 271, 3, 16, 515586) It was you who ensnared her.
('73', 271, 3, 17, 515615) What is the meaning, then, of your growling at her now if she cannot live without you?
('73', 271, 3, 18, 515702) She is your helpmate, your partner in dharma, and not your slave or your property.
('73', 271, 3, 19, 515785) It is not proper that you should first make a doll of her and then treat her as your property.
('73', 271, 3, 20, 515880) Do not dismiss all this in a fit of anger.
('73', 271, 3, 21, 515923) Remember that I am a man of experience.
('73', 271, 3, 22, 515963) I am afraid there is no way out except marriage.
('73', 271, 3, 23, 516012) After the marriage you may do what you like.
('73', 271, 3, 24, 516057) Do not worry if I do not give my consent to the marriage.
('73', 271, 3, 25, 516115) It should be enough for you that I do not oppose it.
('73', 271, 3, 26, 516168) It would of course be best if you two could bear separation and be content with writing to each other from time to time and meeting occasionally.
('73', 271, 3, 27, 516314) But that seems impossible so far as Saraswati is concerned.
('73', 271, 3, 28, 516374) Think over what you should do after the marriage.
('73', 271, 3, 29, 516424) Discuss the matter with me.
('73', 271, 3, 30, 516452) My feeling is that you will have to give up study afterwards.
('73', 271, 3, 31, 516514) But I shall be happy if my fear is proved wrong and both of you study together, as Saraswati says you will.
('73', 271, 3, 32, 516622) You may now think calmly and do what you please.
('73', 271, 3, 33, 516671) Meanwhile I am tending Saraswati like a flower.
('73', 271, 4, 34, 516719) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] I had finished this letter before I sent you the wire1, but kept it back on getting your letter.

('73', 272, 3, 7, 517194) My stars seem to be unfavourable.

('73', 273, 2, 3, 518339) SEGAON, July 6, 1938
('73', 273, 3, 4, 518360) QUESTION: What is the place of religious instruction in the Wardha Scheme of Education?
('73', 273, 4, 5, 518448) ANSWER: We have left out the teaching of religions from the Wardha Scheme of Education, because we are afraid that religions as they are taught and practised today lead to conflict rather than unity.
('73', 273, 4, 6, 518648) But on the other hand, I hold that the truths that are common to all religions can and should be taught to all children.
('73', 273, 4, 7, 518769) These truths cannot be taught through words or through books.
('73', 273, 4, 8, 518831) The children can learn these truths only through the daily life of the teacher.
('73', 273, 4, 9, 518911) If the teacher himself lives up to the tenets of truth and justice, then alone can the children learn that truth and justice are the basis of all religions.
('73', 273, 5, 10, 519068) When Mahatmaji was asked whether it was possible to teach children between the ages of seven and fourteen equal respect for all religions he said: Yes, I think so.
('73', 273, 5, 11, 519232) The truth that all religions are the same in essentials, that we must love and respect others' faiths as we respect our own, is a very simple truth, and can easily be understood and practised by children of seven.
('73', 273, 5, 12, 519446) But, of course, the first essential is that the teacher must have this faith himself.

('73', 273, 9, 17, 519642) Of course you pass through Wardha on your way to B 2. That means you may be here when the W. C. meets.

('73', 274, 1, 8, 520466) He is raising India in the estimation of the West.

('73', 274, 1, 10, 520595) This work does not need thousands.
('73', 274, 1, 11, 520630) True immolation of a few will do the trick.
('73', 274, 1, 12, 520674) You are wrong.
('73', 274, 1, 13, 520689) I began work among women when I was not even thirty years old.
('73', 274, 1, 14, 520752) There is not a woman in S.A. who does not know me.
('73', 274, 1, 15, 520803) But my work was among the poorest.
('73', 274, 1, 16, 520838) The intellectuals I could not draw.
('73', 274, 1, 17, 520874) My appeals have always been from heart to hearts.
('73', 274, 1, 18, 520924) I have felt like fish out of water in the company of intellectuals.
('73', 274, 1, 19, 520992) Hence you are wrong in laying down the sweeping proposition you have.
('73', 274, 1, 20, 521062) You can't blame me for not having organized the intellectuals among women.
('73', 274, 1, 21, 521137) I have not the gift.
('73', 274, 1, 22, 521158) And then my method of organizing is out of the ordinary, not necessarily superior.
('73', 274, 1, 23, 521241) All I mean is that I have nothing to show on paper.
('73', 274, 1, 24, 521293) But just as I never fear coldness on the part of the poor when I approach them, I never fear it when I approach poor women.
('73', 274, 1, 25, 521417) There is invisible bond between them and me.
('73', 274, 1, 26, 521462) And why do you miss the agony I am passing through?
('73', 274, 1, 27, 521514) Is it not for woman kind?
('73', 274, 1, 28, 521540) I am wringing my soul for adequate purity, to enable me [to] render greater service to them and through them to the whole of humanity.
('73', 274, 1, 29, 521675) Ahimsa, which is my sheet anchor, demands all this.

('73', 275, 12, 23, 523013) A man giving way to anger mis spends it or rather destroys it, thus rendering it unfruitful.
('73', 275, 12, 24, 523106) To that extent brahmacharya has been damaged.
('73', 275, 12, 25, 523152) Similarly a man wastes his vital fluid when he indulges in intercourse for the sake of pleasure, as it is unproductive.
('73', 276, 0, 1, 523272) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 277
('73', 276, 1, 2, 523322) When a man has no desire for sensual pleasure and both the man and the woman desire a child and come together for that purpose, then alone is vital fluid completely fruitful.
('73', 276, 1, 3, 523497) Such a couple are truly brahmacharis.
('73', 276, 1, 4, 523535) But such a couple might be only one among crores.
('73', 276, 1, 5, 523585) Apart from the one single occasion of copulation they live like brother and sister and refrain from any sensual indulgence in thought, speech, contact or any other way.
('73', 276, 1, 6, 523754) Their intercourse for the purpose of procreation alone can in no way come under the category of gratification of the senses.
('73', 276, 1, 7, 523879) This ought to clear your doubt.

('73', 276, 5, 10, 523967) 342. THE STATES
('73', 276, 6, 11, 523983) Events seem to have justified the wisdom of the Congress resolution of non intervention in the affairs of the States.
('73', 276, 6, 12, 524101) The constitution, however unjust, arbitrary and illogical it may be, is such that, legally and politically, every State, small or big, is an independent entity in its relation to the other States and that part of India which is called British in contradistinction from the States.
('73', 276, 6, 13, 524382) The similarity common to all is that they are under the iron grip of British Rule.
('73', 276, 6, 14, 524465) But geographically and ethnically the people of the States and the other parts of India are one and indivisible.
('73', 276, 6, 15, 524578) We, the thirty three crores of men and women, are blood relations who cannot be parted by any constitutional or military device.
('73', 276, 6, 16, 524707) This natural relationship is working itself without let or hindrance because of the recognition of the constitutional fact while it lasts.
('73', 276, 6, 17, 524846) That is the way of satyagraha or the way of non resistance to evil.
('73', 276, 6, 18, 524914) It is the aseptic method in which the physician allows the poison to work itself out by setting in motion all the natural forces and letting them have full play.
('73', 276, 6, 19, 525076) By its resolution of non interference the Congress put the States people on their mettle, in other words set in motion the natural forces, i.e., the powers latent in the people themselves.
('73', 276, 6, 20, 525265) In the few recent instances it has been found that the people having discovered their strength they used it without any aid from outside and won full victory.
('73', 276, 6, 21, 525424) The result also was that the assistance of Congressmen was invoked by the States authorities in order to settle the differences between themselves and their people.
('73', 276, 6, 22, 525589) No doubt this method like every other known to mankind has its limitations.
('73', 276, 6, 23, 525665) The Congress cannot
('73', 277, 0, 1, 525685) 278 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 277, 1, 2, 525727) dictate unreasonable terms.
('73', 277, 1, 3, 525755) The people must have a real grievance and they must approach it with pure hands.
('73', 277, 1, 4, 525836) For the tool of satyagraha is ahimsa, i.e., self suffering without inflicting suffering on the opponent for the vindication of a cause which must be absolutely just.
('73', 277, 1, 5, 526002) If only the people of the States can realize the full meaning and potency of satyagraha, i.e., of non violence, they will win their relative freedom before India as a whole comes to its own.
('73', 277, 1, 6, 526193) And they will have to before India has Independence.
('73', 277, 1, 7, 526246) Thus they can have full liberty of non violent speech, writing and action without having to deal with cumbersome British machinery.
('73', 277, 1, 8, 526378) They can secure with comparative ease a more equitable, even if not an equal, distribution of the wealth produced in the States.
('73', 277, 1, 9, 526507) They can, without much effort, regulate the privy purse of their Princes and can have cheap and pure justice guaranteed.
('73', 277, 1, 10, 526628) They can deal with the problem of poverty and village reconstruction with infinitely greater ease than in unwieldy and bureaucracy ridden British India.
('73', 277, 1, 11, 526781) They can have real national education for the wanting.
('73', 277, 1, 12, 526836) This will be their swarajno doubt far short of the Indepen dence that the Congress wants.
('73', 277, 1, 13, 526926) But if the people of the majority of the major States attain their full height, the day of Independence will be hastened in a manner no one has dreamt of.
('73', 277, 1, 14, 527081) Let not the reformers in the States therefore be unduly impatient; let them not forget their limitations and above all the conditions of success, viz., strictest observance of truth and non violence.
('73', 277, 1, 15, 527281) They must be ready to face bullets without flinching but also without lifting their little finger in so called self defence.
('73', 277, 1, 16, 527406) A satyagrahi abjures the right of self defence.
('73', 277, 1, 17, 527454) Let it also be remembered that a satyagrahis minimum is also his maximum.

('73', 277, 4, 20, 527568) The Rt.
('73', 277, 4, 21, 527576) Shri Srinivasa Sastri has criticized, as he had a perfect right to do, the views I timidly and very briefly expressed some time ago on higher education.
('73', 277, 4, 22, 527729) I entertain a very high regard for him as man, patriot and scholar.
('73', 277, 4, 23, 527797) It is therefore always painful to me when I find myself disagreeing with him.
('73', 277, 4, 24, 527875) And yet duty compels me to re express my views on higher education more fully than before, so that the reader may make out for himself the difference between his views and mine.
('73', 278, 0, 1, 528053) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 279
('73', 278, 1, 2, 528103) I admit my limitations.
('73', 278, 1, 3, 528127) I have no university education worth the name.
('73', 278, 1, 4, 528174) My high school career was never above the average.
('73', 278, 1, 5, 528225) I was thankful if I could pass my examinations.
('73', 278, 1, 6, 528273) Distinction in the school was beyond my aspiration.
('73', 278, 1, 7, 528325) Nevertheless I do hold very strong views on education in general, including what is called higher education.
('73', 278, 1, 8, 528434) And I owe it to the country that my views should be clearly known and taken for what they may be worth.
('73', 278, 1, 9, 528538) I must shed the timidity that has led almost to self suppression.
('73', 278, 1, 10, 528604) I must not fear ridicule, and even loss of popularity or prestige.
('73', 278, 1, 11, 528671) If I hide my belief, I shall never correct errors of judgment.
('73', 278, 1, 12, 528734) I am always eager to discover them and more than eager to correct them.
('73', 278, 1, 13, 528806) Let me now state my conclusions held for a number of years and enforced wherever I had opportunity of enforcing them: (1) I am not opposed to education even of the highest type attainable in the world.
('73', 278, 1, 14, 529008) (2) The State must pay for it wherever it has definite use for it.
('73', 278, 1, 15, 529075) (3) I am opposed to all higher education being paid for from the general revenue.
('73', 278, 1, 16, 529157) (4) It is my firm conviction that the vast amount of the so called education in arts, given in our colleges, is sheer waste and has resulted in unemployment among the educated classes.
('73', 278, 1, 17, 529342) What is more, it has destroyed the health, both mental and physical, of the boys and girls who have the misfortune to go through the grind in our colleges.
('73', 278, 1, 18, 529498) (5) The medium of a foreign language through which higher education has been imparted in India has caused incalculable intellectual and moral injury to the nation.
('73', 278, 1, 19, 529662) We are too near our own times to judge the enormity of the damage done.
('73', 278, 1, 20, 529734) And we who have received such education have both to be victims and judgesan almost impossible feat.
('73', 278, 1, 21, 529835) I must now give my reason for the conclusions set forth above.
('73', 278, 1, 22, 529898) This I can best do, perhaps, by giving a chapter from my own experience.
('73', 278, 1, 23, 529971) Up to the age of 12 all the knowledge I gained was through Gujarati, my mother tongue.
('73', 278, 1, 24, 530058) I knew then something of arithmetic, history and geography.
('73', 278, 1, 25, 530118) Then I entered a high school.
('73', 278, 1, 26, 530148) For the first three years the mother tongue was still the medium.
('73', 278, 1, 27, 530214) But the school masters business was to drive English into the pupils head.
('73', 278, 1, 28, 530289) Therefore more than half of our time was given to learning English and mastering its arbitrary spelling and pronunciation.
('73', 278, 1, 29, 530412) It was a painful discovery to have to learn a language that was not pronounced as it was written.
('73', 278, 1, 30, 530510) It was a strange experience to have to learn the spelling by
('73', 279, 0, 1, 530571) 280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 279, 1, 2, 530613) But that is by the way, and irrelevant to my argument.
('73', 279, 1, 3, 530668) However, for the first three years, it was comparatively plain sailing.
('73', 279, 1, 4, 530740) The pillory began with the fourth year.
('73', 279, 1, 5, 530780) Everything had to be learnt through Englishgeometry, algebra, chemistry, astronomy, history, geography.
('73', 279, 1, 6, 530884) The tyranny of English was so great that even Sanskrit or Persian had to be learnt through English, not through the mother tongue.
('73', 279, 1, 7, 531015) If any boy spoke in the class in Gujarati which he understood, he was punished.
('73', 279, 1, 8, 531095) It did not matter to the teacher if a boy spoke bad English which he could neither pronounce correctly nor understand fully.
('73', 279, 1, 9, 531220) Why should the teacher worry?
('73', 279, 1, 10, 531250) His own English was by no means without blemish.
('73', 279, 1, 11, 531299) It could not be otherwise.
('73', 279, 1, 12, 531326) English was as much a foreign language to him as to his pupils.
('73', 279, 1, 13, 531390) The result was chaos.
('73', 279, 1, 14, 531412) We the boys had to learn many things by heart, though we could not understand them fully and often not at all.
('73', 279, 1, 15, 531523) My head used to reel as the teacher was struggling to make his exposition on geometry understood by us.
('73', 279, 1, 16, 531627) I could make neither head nor tail of geometry till we reached the 13th theorem of the first book of Euclid.
('73', 279, 1, 17, 531736) And let me confess to the reader that in spite of all my love for the mother tongue I do not to this day know the Gujarati equivalents of the technical terms of geometry, algebra and the like.
('73', 279, 1, 18, 531929) I know now that what I took four years to learn of arithmetic, geometry, algebra, chemistry and astronomy I should have learnt easily in one year if I had not to learn them through English but Gujarati.
('73', 279, 1, 19, 532132) My grasp of the subjects would have been easier and clearer.
('73', 279, 1, 20, 532193) My Gujarati vocabulary would have been richer.
('73', 279, 1, 21, 532240) I would have made use of such knowledge in my own home.
('73', 279, 1, 22, 532296) This English medium created an impassable barrier between me and the members of my family, who had not gone through English schools.
('73', 279, 1, 23, 532429) My father knew nothing of what I was doing.
('73', 279, 1, 24, 532473) I could not, even if I had wished it, interest my father in what I was learning.
('73', 279, 1, 25, 532554) For though he had ample intelligence, he knew not a word of English.
('73', 279, 1, 26, 532623) I was fast becoming a stranger in my own home.
('73', 279, 1, 27, 532670) I certainly became a superior person.
('73', 279, 1, 28, 532708) Even my dress began to undergo imperceptible changes.
('73', 279, 1, 29, 532762) What happened to me was not an uncommon experience.
('73', 279, 1, 30, 532814) It was common to the majority.
('73', 279, 1, 31, 532845) The first three years in the high school made little addition to my stock of general knowledge.
('73', 279, 1, 32, 532941) They were a preparation for fitting the boys for teaching them everything through English.
('73', 279, 1, 33, 533032) High schools were schools for cultural conquest by the English.
('73', 279, 1, 34, 533096) The knowledge gained by the three hundred boys of my high school became a circumscribed possession.
('73', 279, 1, 35, 533196) It was not for transmission to the masses.
('73', 280, 0, 1, 533239) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 281
('73', 280, 1, 2, 533289) A word about literature.
('73', 280, 1, 3, 533314) We had to learn several books of English prose and English poetry.
('73', 280, 1, 4, 533381) No doubt all this was nice.
('73', 280, 1, 5, 533409) But that knowledge has been of no use to me in serving or bringing me in touch with the masses.
('73', 280, 1, 6, 533505) I am unable to say that if I had not learnt what I did of English prose and poetry, I should have missed a rare treasure.
('73', 280, 1, 7, 533627) If I had, instead, passed those precious seven years in mastering Gujarati and had learnt mathematics, sciences, and Sanskrit and other subjects through Gujarati, I could easily have shared the knowledge so gained with my neighbours.
('73', 280, 1, 8, 533861) I would have enriched Gujarati, and who can say that I would not have, with my habit of application and my inordinate love for the country and the mother tongue, made a richer and greater contribution to the service of the masses?
('73', 280, 1, 9, 534092) I must not be understood to decry English or its noble litera ture.
('73', 280, 1, 10, 534160) The columns of Harijan are sufficient evidence of my love of English.
('73', 280, 1, 11, 534230) But the nobility of its literature cannot avail the Indian nation any more than the temperate climate or the scenery of England can avail her.
('73', 280, 1, 12, 534373) India has to flourish in her own climate and scenery and her own literature, even though all the three may be inferior to the English climate, scenery and literature.
('73', 280, 1, 13, 534540) We and our children must build on our own heritage.
('73', 280, 1, 14, 534592) If we borrow another, we impoverish our own.
('73', 280, 1, 15, 534637) We can never grow on foreign victuals.
('73', 280, 1, 16, 534676) I want the nation to have the treasures contained in that language, and for that matter the other languages of the world, through its own vernaculars.
('73', 280, 1, 17, 534827) I do not need to learn Bengali in order to know the beauties of Rabindranaths matchless produc tions.
('73', 280, 1, 18, 534929) I get them through good translations.
('73', 280, 1, 19, 534967) Gujarati boys and girls do not need to learn Russian to appreciate Tolstoys short stories.
('73', 280, 1, 20, 535058) They learn them through good translations.
('73', 280, 1, 21, 535101) It is the boast of Englishmen that the best of the worlds literary output is in the hands of that nation in simple English inside of a week of its publication.
('73', 280, 1, 22, 535261) Why need I learn English to get at the best of what Shakespeare and Milton thought and wrote?
('73', 280, 1, 23, 535355) It would be good economy to set apart a class of students whose business would be to learn the best of what is to be learnt in the different languages of the world and give the translation in the vernaculars.
('73', 280, 1, 24, 535564) Our masters chose the wrong way for us, and habit has made the wrong appear as right.
('73', 280, 1, 25, 535650) I find daily proof of the increasing and continuing wrong being done to the millions by our false de Indianizing education.
('73', 280, 1, 26, 535774) Those graduates who are my valued associates themselves flounder when they have to give expression to their innermost thoughts.
('73', 280, 1, 27, 535902) They are strangers in their own homes.
('73', 280, 1, 28, 535941) Their vocabulary in the mother tongue
('73', 281, 0, 1, 535979) 282 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 281, 1, 2, 536021) is so limited that they cannot always finish their speech without having recourse to English words and even sentences.
('73', 281, 1, 3, 536140) Nor can they exist without English books.
('73', 281, 1, 4, 536182) They often write to one another in English.
('73', 281, 1, 5, 536226) I cite the case of my companions to show how deep the evil has gone.
('73', 281, 1, 6, 536295) For we have made a conscious effort to mend ourselves.
('73', 281, 1, 7, 536350) It has been argued that the wastage that occurs in our colleges need not worry us if, out of the collegians, one Jagadish Bose can be produced by them.
('73', 281, 1, 8, 536502) I should freely subscribe to the argument if the wastage was unavoidable.
('73', 281, 1, 9, 536576) I hope I have shown that it was and is even now avoidable.
('73', 281, 1, 10, 536635) Moreover, the creation of a Bose does not help the argument.
('73', 281, 1, 11, 536696) For Bose was not a product of the present education.
('73', 281, 1, 12, 536749) He rose in spite of the terrible handicaps under which he had to labour.
('73', 281, 1, 13, 536822) And his knowledge became almost intransmissible to the masses.
('73', 281, 1, 14, 536885) We seem to have come to think that no one can hope to be like a Bose unless he knows English.
('73', 281, 1, 15, 536979) I cannot conceive a grosser superstition than this.
('73', 281, 1, 16, 537031) No Japanese feels so helpless as we seem to do.
('73', 281, 1, 17, 537079) Nothing but a heroic remedy can deal with the deep seated evil which I have endeavoured to describe.
('73', 281, 1, 18, 537180) The Congress Ministers can, if they will, mitigate it if they cannot remove it.
('73', 281, 1, 19, 537260) Universities must be made self supporting.
('73', 281, 1, 20, 537303) The State should simply educate those whose services it would need.
('73', 281, 1, 21, 537371) For all other branches of learning it should encourage private effort.
('73', 281, 1, 22, 537442) The medium of instruction should be altered at once and at any cost, the provincial languages being given their rightful place.
('73', 281, 1, 23, 537570) I would prefer temporary chaos in higher education to the criminal waste that is daily accumulating.
('73', 281, 1, 24, 537671) In order to enhance the status and the market value of the provincial languages, I would have the language of the law courts to be the language of the province where the court is situated.
('73', 281, 1, 25, 537860) The proceedings of the Provincial Legislatures must be in the language, or even the languages of the province where a province has more than one language within its borders.
('73', 281, 1, 26, 538034) I suggest to the legislators that they could, by enough application, inside of a month, understand the languages of their provinces.
('73', 281, 1, 27, 538167) There is nothing to prevent a Tamilian from easily learning the simple grammar and a few hundred words of Telugu, Malayalam and Kanarese, all allied to Tamil.
('73', 281, 1, 28, 538326) At the centre Hindustani must rule supreme.
('73', 281, 1, 29, 538370) In my opinion this is not a question to be decided by acade micians.
('73', 281, 1, 30, 538439) They cannot decide through what language the boys and girls of a place are to be educated.
('73', 281, 1, 31, 538530) That question is already decided
('73', 282, 0, 1, 538563) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 283
('73', 282, 1, 2, 538613) for them in every free country.
('73', 282, 1, 3, 538645) Nor can they decide the subjects to be taught.
('73', 282, 1, 4, 538692) That depends upon the wants of the country to which they belong.
('73', 282, 1, 5, 538757) Theirs is the privilege of enforcing the nations will in the best manner possible.
('73', 282, 1, 6, 538840) When this country becomes really free the question of medium will be settled only one way.
('73', 282, 1, 7, 538931) The academicians will frame the syllabus and prepare text books accordingly.
('73', 282, 1, 8, 539008) And the products of the education of a free India will answer the requirements of the country as today they answer those of the foreign ruler.
('73', 282, 1, 9, 539151) So long as we the educated classes play with this question.
('73', 282, 1, 10, 539211) I very much fear we shall not produce the free and healthy India of our dream.
('73', 282, 1, 11, 539290) We have to grow by strenuous effort out of our bondage, whether it is educational, economical, social or political.
('73', 282, 1, 12, 539406) The effort itself is three fourths of the battle.
('73', 282, 1, 13, 539456) Thus I claim that I am not an enemy of higher education.
('73', 282, 1, 14, 539513) But I am an enemy of higher education as it is given in this country.
('73', 282, 1, 15, 539583) Under my scheme there will be more and better libraries, more and better laboratories, more and better research institutes.
('73', 282, 1, 16, 539707) Under it we should have an army of chemists, engineers and other experts who will be real servants of the nation and answer the varied and growing requirements of a people who are becoming increasingly conscious of their rights and wants.
('73', 282, 1, 17, 539946) And all these experts will speak not a foreign language but the language of the people.
('73', 282, 1, 18, 540034) The knowledge gained by them will be the common property of the people.
('73', 282, 1, 19, 540106) There will be truly original work instead of mere imitation.
('73', 282, 1, 20, 540167) And the cost will be evenly and justly distributed.

('73', 283, 2, 3, 540339) NARANDAS, I got your pamphlet1. The Rentia Baras day is or should be the time for drawing up an annual balance sheet of the progress of khadi work and thinking out ways and means of speeding it up.
('73', 283, 2, 4, 540537) I see that your resolutions are increasing in number every year.
('73', 283, 2, 5, 540602) But in comparison to what we have to achieve, even this increased number of resolutions are nothing.
('73', 283, 2, 6, 540703) According to the saying, drop by drop fills the lake, we should content ourselves with doing the best we are capable of.
('73', 283, 2, 7, 540824) Let all participants in this yajna remember that we should not rest satisfied till the daily income of all workers including the spinners reaches eight annas for a day of eight hours.
('73', 283, 2, 8, 541008) And in order to achieve that we should be proficient in all aspects of the charkha science.
('73', 283, 2, 9, 541100) In that way we shall be able to improve the quality of the khadi without raising the prices very much.
('73', 283, 2, 10, 541203) If we master that science, we can prove that khadi, though apparently costly, is actually bound to be cheap.
('73', 283, 2, 11, 541312) I hope to be able to send someone for the Rentia Baras day.

('73', 283, 4, 16, 541568) It is not going to be easy.
('73', 283, 4, 17, 541596) The whole policy will have to be reconsidered.
('73', 283, 4, 18, 541643) If even one false step is taken, then there is serious danger of the whole structure which is being built falling to pieces.
('73', 283, 4, 19, 541768) If you come on Tuesday we will think over it.
('73', 283, 4, 20, 541814) Come in the afternoon if the time suits you.

('73', 285, 2, 4, 543472) You must not allow your imagination to destroy your sanity.
('73', 285, 2, 5, 543532) I have taken no drastic step.
('73', 285, 2, 6, 543562) I shifted to Pyarelals hole for giving Hanna the privacy she needed.
('73', 285, 2, 7, 543631) She is wholly unaccustomed to our ways.

('73', 285, 2, 20, 544301) She is most lovable but I fear she is too delicate to be able to stay here long.
('73', 285, 2, 21, 544382) I shall expect you on 23rd, the day of the meeting of the W. C. It is quite cool just now but the road is fearfully muddy.
('73', 285, 2, 22, 544505) You will feel a little crowded.

('73', 289, 2, 3, 549679) I welcome your advertising the principles in defence of which Hind Swaraj was written.1 The English edition is a translation of the original which was in Gujarati.
('73', 289, 2, 4, 549843) I might change the language here and there if I had to rewrite the booklet.
('73', 289, 2, 5, 549919) But after the stormy thirty years through which I have since passed, I have seen nothing to make me alter the views expounded in it.
('73', 289, 2, 6, 550052) Let the reader bear in mind that it is a faithful record of conversations I had with workers, one of whom was an avowed anarchist.
('73', 289, 2, 7, 550183) He should also know that it stopped the rot that was about to set in among some Indians in South Africa.
('73', 289, 2, 8, 550288) The reader
('73', 289, 3, 9, 550299) 1 A special issue of The Aryan Path exclusively devoted to Hind Swaraj, then being planned, came out in September.
('73', 289, 3, 10, 550414) The contributors included such eminent Western thinkers as Frederick Soddy, G.D.H. Cole, C. Delisle Burns, John Middleton Murry, Hugh IAnson Fausset, Gerald Heard and Irene Rathbone.
('73', 289, 3, 11, 550597) Though none of them found themselves wholly in agreement with the thesis advanced in Hind Swaraj they all nevertheless saw the great importance of the work.
('73', 289, 3, 12, 550754) Frederick Soddy, for instance, though disagreeing with Gandhiji, suggested that anyone who wishes to change the world would do well to study the book.
('73', 289, 3, 13, 550905) To G. D. H. Cole Gandhijis case against the West looked infinitely stronger than it did in 1908, when the ephemeral civilization of the West looked stable under Western eyes.
('73', 289, 3, 14, 551080) C. Delisle Burns saw the highest merit of Hind Swaraj in its emphasis upon moral issues and opposition to the pursuit of private wealth and power.
('73', 289, 3, 15, 551227) John Middleton Murry considered Hind Swaraj a great book, one of the spiritual classics of the world, and compared Gandhijis vision of real swaraj to the Christian vision of the Kingdom of Heaven.
('73', 289, 3, 16, 551424) Gerald Heard thought Hind Swaraj was superior to Rousseaus Social Contract and Karl Marxs Das Capital, for it did not mark the end of an age but the beginning of a new order.
('73', 289, 3, 17, 551599) Irene Rathbone found the book enormously powerful, the language of which forced her by its tremendous honesty to search my own honesty.
('73', 289, 3, 18, 551735) She thought the work was simple and logical, economical, condensed, poetic.
('73', 289, 3, 19, 551811) Hugh Fausset summed up Hind Swaraj as a book whose purpose was to save India, not from Englishmen, but from the modern civilization which is eating into the vitals of the West.
('73', 289, 3, 20, 551988) He had enough trust in the indestructible vitality of the human spirit to be sure that it would not allow itself to be lastingly mechanized.
('73', 289, 3, 21, 552129) The machine was exposing ruthlessly the consequences that must happen to men and nations who had lost their integrity.
('73', 289, 3, 22, 552248) Hind Swaraj was an attempt at restoring man to his true estate, and was, for this reason, one of the best modern handbooks of that real revolution which must happen in us all, if we are to fulfil the creative purpose of life.

('73', 290, 7, 12, 553168) MY DEAR IDIOT, What a sad and wretched letter, yours of 11th.
('73', 290, 7, 13, 553230) I am enjoying myself and you are sorrowing for nothing.
('73', 290, 7, 14, 553286) When you come here, you will laugh at your own folly.
('73', 290, 7, 15, 553340) My misery is superficial if there is any yet left.
('73', 290, 7, 16, 553391) My peace cannot be permanently taken away by anything or anybody.
('73', 290, 7, 17, 553457) You simply do not know me if you think that my experiences have undone me.
('73', 290, 7, 18, 553532) If there is real attempt at purification, it must strengthen me and make me more joyful.
('73', 290, 7, 19, 553621) But how can I help you if you must allow your imagination to run riot?
('73', 290, 8, 20, 553692) 1 Mahadev Desai in a preface to Hind Swaraj published by the Navajivan Trust wrote: When Gokhale saw the translation, on his visit to South Africa in 1912, he thought it so crude and hastily conceived that he prophesied that Gandhiji would himself destroy the book after spending a year in India.

('73', 291, 1, 2, 554291) You have to apologize about women.
('73', 291, 1, 3, 554326) I could not organize intellectual women as such.
('73', 291, 1, 4, 554375) 1 I have not organized intellectual men as such.
('73', 291, 1, 5, 554424) But this thing does not lend itself to argument.
('73', 291, 1, 6, 554473) I simply cannot subscribe to the charge that there has been any neglect on my part about organizing women.
('73', 291, 1, 7, 554580) It may be that I have not had the qualifi cations for doing better.
('73', 291, 1, 8, 554648) But that would [be] no charge against me.
('73', 291, 1, 9, 554690) However I do not mind your complaint.
('73', 291, 1, 10, 554728) I rather like it.

('73', 292, 5, 17, 556768) 361. SPEAKERS AND POLITICS
('73', 292, 6, 18, 556795) Some controversy has raged round the propriety of the Speakers of the various Provincial Assemblies taking an active part in politics.
('73', 292, 6, 19, 556930) There has been the Speakers ruling and a full debate and a resolution in the U. P. Assembly to the effect that the Speaker can consistently with the due discharge of the obligations of office take an active part in politics.
('73', 292, 6, 20, 557155) Shri Sambamurti was with me for a few days and exhaustively discussed the question with me.
('73', 292, 6, 21, 557247) He read to me copious extracts from authoritative treatises dealing with the Speakers duties in the Parliaments of the world.
('73', 292, 6, 22, 557373) And there has appeared an article in Harijan by Shri Satyamurti.
('73', 292, 6, 23, 557438) I had a long discussion on the question with Shri Purushottamdas Tandon during his recent visit to Wardha.
('73', 292, 6, 24, 557545) After all these discussions and study of the subject I seem to hold a view perhaps different from those I have heard and read.
('73', 292, 6, 25, 557672) Mine is derived from my conception of the acceptance of office by Con gressmen.
('73', 292, 6, 26, 557752) When I advised the Working Committee to authorize accep tance of office, the idea was that whilst the letter of the Government of
('73', 293, 0, 1, 557882) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 294
('73', 293, 1, 2, 557924) India Act should not be transgressed, its interpretation should be stretched to the farthest limit so as to widen the liberty of the people and to strengthen the Congress.
('73', 293, 1, 3, 558096) The Act was not to be worked in the manner conceived by its authors, but while it lasted should be fully used for the advancement of the Congress goal and therefore in a manner least expected by its authors.
('73', 293, 1, 4, 558304) Such being my conception of office acceptance, British and foreign precedents are of little use to me.
('73', 293, 1, 5, 558407) Moreover, in the nature of things, they can help us but little for the simple reason that unlike ours the constitutions of the worlds Parliaments are not imposed on the respective peoples but are their own creation.
('73', 293, 1, 6, 558623) A Congressman who is a member of an Assembly, no matter what office he occupies there, is subject to the discipline of the Congress and has to carry out its instructions from time to time.
('73', 293, 1, 7, 558812) Therefore, so long as the Government of India Act does not in so many words prohibit it, the Congress may, if it thinks it necessary, require Speakers in the Congress Provinces to take an active part in the politics of the country.
('73', 293, 1, 8, 559044) But the Congress, as far as I know, has not considered the ques tion.
('73', 293, 1, 9, 559114) In my opinion Congressmen who are members of Assemblies, whether as mere members or Ministers or Speakers, have in every act of theirs to bear in mind the fact that they have, in virtue of the Congress constitution, to conform to truth and non violence.
('73', 293, 1, 10, 559368) Thus the conduct of a Congressman in an Assembly would have to be that of strictest honesty and courtesy in dealing with his opponents.
('73', 293, 1, 11, 559504) He will not resort to shady politics, will not hit below the belt, will never take a mean advantage of his adversary.
('73', 293, 1, 12, 559622) The greater his position in the Assembly, the greater is his responsibility in these matters.
('73', 293, 1, 13, 559716) A member in the Assembly no doubt represents his constituency and his party but he also represents the whole of his province.
('73', 293, 1, 14, 559842) A Minister no doubt advances his own party but never at the expense of the nation as a whole.
('73', 293, 1, 15, 559936) Indeed he advances the Congress only so far as he advances the nation.
('73', 293, 1, 16, 560007) For he knows that if he has no sword to give battle to the foreign ruler, he has it not to give battle to his adversary inside the nation itself.
('73', 293, 1, 17, 560153) And since the Assembly is the place where all commu nities meet together willy nilly, it is the place where by winning over his opponents he expects to forge sanctions which can be made irresistible.
('73', 293, 1, 18, 560353) All the problems that affect the body politic including communal unity can be solved if the Assembly is regarded not merely
('73', 294, 0, 1, 560477) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 295
('73', 294, 1, 2, 560527) in terms of the Government of India Act but as an instrument to be used for solving questions which representatives of different commu nities composing the nation can be expected to solve if they had unrestricted powers.
('73', 294, 1, 3, 560748) And the Government of India Act does not pre vent the use of the Assemblies for solving the many problems which are outside its scope but which are necessary for national progress.
('73', 294, 1, 4, 560929) Looked at from the point of view here suggested, the Speakers position assumes very high importance, greater than that of the Prime Minister.
('73', 294, 1, 5, 561071) For he has to discharge the functions of a judge while he occupies the chair.
('73', 294, 1, 6, 561149) He has to give impartial and just rulings.
('73', 294, 1, 7, 561192) He has to enforce decorum and laws of courtesy between members.
('73', 294, 1, 8, 561256) He has to be calm in the midst of storms.
('73', 294, 1, 9, 561298) He has opportunities of winning over opponents which no other member of the House can possibly have.
('73', 294, 1, 10, 561399) Now if a Speaker outside the House ceases to be impartial and indulges in party polemics, he cannot possibly carry the weight he would if he observed impartiality and calmness everywhere.
('73', 294, 1, 11, 561587) I claim that if a Speaker cultivates the habit of uniform impartiality outside his own very limited sphere, he will enhance the Congress prestige.
('73', 294, 1, 12, 561734) He can, if he realizes the unique opportunity his office gives him, pave the way for the solution of the Hindu Muslim tangle as also many others.
('73', 294, 1, 13, 561880) Thus in my opinion the Speaker, if he has to be that not only inside but outside the House, must be a first class Congressman.
('73', 294, 1, 14, 562007) As a man too he has to have a character without reproach.
('73', 294, 1, 15, 562065) He must be able, fearless, naturally just, and above all truthful and non violent in thought, word and deed.
('73', 294, 1, 16, 562174) Then he may stand on any platform he likes.

('73', 294, 2, 18, 562237) 362. SOME OBJECTIONS
('73', 294, 3, 19, 562258) A Muslim correspondent writes:
('73', 294, 4, 20, 562289) During the last four months opinions have been appearing in the Urdu Press regarding the Wardha scheme.
('73', 294, 4, 21, 562393) As usual nobody seems to have read the report carefully or to have thought out the subject of basic educations.
('73', 294, 4, 22, 562505) The objections centre round three points:
('73', 294, 5, 23, 562547) (a) that religious instruction has been completely ignored;
('73', 294, 6, 24, 562607) (b) that boys and girls are to be taught together; and
('73', 294, 7, 25, 562662) (c) that a respect for all religions is to be inculcated.
('73', 294, 8, 26, 562720) These objections have been culled from the Urdu Press.
('73', 294, 8, 27, 562775) Religious instruction in the sense of denominational religion has been deliberately omitted.
('73', 294, 8, 28, 562868) Unless there is a State religion it is very
('73', 295, 0, 1, 562912) THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 296
('73', 295, 1, 2, 562954) difficult, if not impossible, to provide religious instruction as it would mean providing for every denomination.
('73', 295, 1, 3, 563068) Such instruction is best given at home.
('73', 295, 1, 4, 563108) The State should allow enough time for every child to receive such instruction at home or otherwise.
('73', 295, 1, 5, 563209) It is also conceivable that the State should provide facilities for private tuition by those denominations which may wish to instruct their children at school provided that such instruction is paid for by such denominations.
('73', 295, 1, 6, 563434) As for co education, the Zakir Husain Committee has not made it compulsory.
('73', 295, 1, 7, 563510) Where there is a demand for a separate school for girls, the State will have to make provision.
('73', 295, 1, 8, 563606) The question of co education has been left open.
('73', 295, 1, 9, 563655) It will regulate itself according to the time spirit.
('73', 295, 1, 10, 563709) So far as I am aware the members of the Committee were not all of one mind.
('73', 295, 1, 11, 563785) Personally I have an open mind.
('73', 295, 1, 12, 563817) I think that there are just as valid reasons for as against co education.
('73', 295, 1, 13, 563891) And I would not oppose the experiment wherever it is made.
('73', 295, 1, 14, 563950) As to the necessity of teaching equal regard for all religions, I personally hold strong views.
('73', 295, 1, 15, 564046) Till we reach that happy state, I see no prospect of real unity among all the different communities.
('73', 295, 1, 16, 564147) I regard it as fatal to the growth of a friendly spirit among the children belonging to the different faiths if they are taught either that their religion is superior to every other or that it is the only true religion.
('73', 295, 1, 17, 564367) If that exclusive spirit is to pervade the nation, the necessary corollary would be that there should be separate schools for every denomi nation with freedom to each to decry every other, or that the mention of religion must be entirely prohibited.
('73', 295, 1, 18, 564617) The result of such a policy is too dreadful to contemplate.
('73', 295, 1, 19, 564677) Fundamental principles of ethics are common to all religions.
('73', 295, 1, 20, 564739) These should certainly be taught to the children and that should be regarded as adequate religious instruction so far as the schools under the Wardha scheme are concerned.

('73', 295, 2, 22, 564930) 363. A FALLACY
('73', 295, 3, 23, 564945) July 16, 1938 An A.I.S.A. agent asks what he is to say to his co workers who have formed a union and presented him with terms.
('73', 295, 3, 24, 565072) I regard the for mation of such unions a fallacy.
('73', 295, 3, 25, 565122) The workers have evidently missed the scope and the message of the A.I.S.A. It is a philanthropic organization formed by the Congress and has been given an autonomous charter for the specific purpose of developing the central village industry of hand spinning and all it implies.
('73', 295, 3, 26, 565402) Those who are
('73', 296, 0, 1, 565416) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 297
('73', 296, 1, 2, 565466) engaged in this voluntary organization not only derive no pecuniary advantage from it but are expected, if they can, to give their labour free of any hire.
('73', 296, 1, 3, 565622) And since in this the poorest country in the world many persons cannot do so, a large number are paid an emolument only enough to sustain them.
('73', 296, 1, 4, 565766) Whilst every attempt is made to make them comfortable, they are not regarded as employees in the ordinary sense.
('73', 296, 1, 5, 565879) There are no profits shared by anyone.
('73', 296, 1, 6, 565918) If there are share holders or proprietors, they are the spinners, weavers and the like.
('73', 296, 1, 7, 566006) Even the consumers are not beneficiaries.
('73', 296, 1, 8, 566048) They are expected to wear khadi not because it is cheaper or better to look at than mill cloth, but because it gives employment to the largest number of half starved half employed persons, mostly women.
('73', 296, 1, 9, 566251) The whole of the takings go to these dumb artisans after deducting the salaries and other expenses incurred in running this vast philanthropic organization.
('73', 296, 1, 10, 566408) If, therefore, any body of workers form unions as against the Association, they are against the artisans.
('73', 296, 1, 11, 566514) What they take has to come out of the pockets of the artisans or the consumers.
('73', 296, 1, 12, 566594) It would be manifestly absurd to tax the consumers in the interest of the workers.
('73', 296, 1, 13, 566677) Will they, the workers, not realize that the agents are themselves as much workers as they themselves?
('73', 296, 1, 14, 566780) In several cases the agents are purely honorary.
('73', 296, 1, 15, 566829) It is of course a different thing where an agent is found to be going beyond his sphere of duty and acting as if he was the lord and master of, instead of being co worker with, the men working with and under him.
('73', 296, 1, 16, 567042) In such a case the workers have their remedy through the central office but surely not through unions after the orthodox style.
('73', 296, 1, 17, 567170) In the one case they are a necessity, in the other they are not only superfluous, but they are, as I have said above, a fallacy and, if persisted in on a wide scale, they may kill the Asso ciation of which they are part creators and trustees.

('73', 298, 5, 16, 569556) He wanted to know why you had not replied whether or not you had written to Sir Manmath2 regarding him.
('73', 298, 5, 17, 569660) I told him that you would never write to Sir Manmath.
('73', 298, 5, 18, 569714) All the same I promised to find out from you.
('73', 298, 5, 19, 569760) Please let me know now.

('73', 300, 10, 21, 572957) That is no small thing.
('73', 300, 10, 22, 572981) Is it right for you to be unhappy for selfish reasons?
('73', 300, 10, 23, 573036) Is it not better that Ramdas should be happy where he is and does what dharma requires of him rather than that you two were together and felt unhappy looking at each other?
('73', 300, 10, 24, 573209) You are absorbed in your work and it is right that he should do there as he pleases.
('73', 300, 10, 25, 573294) He will return when God wills that he should.
('73', 300, 10, 26, 573340) If, therefore, you have not pulled yourself together, do so after you get this and smile at your foolishness.

('73', 301, 6, 11, 573996) Whether procreation by itself is right or not is a separate issue.
('73', 301, 6, 12, 574063) We can even question whether it is right for a brahmachari to engage in any activity at all.
('73', 301, 6, 13, 574156) But the problem before us is to determine when brahmacharya is violated.
('73', 301, 6, 14, 574229) I hold that no violation of brahmacharya occurs when a man does anything while remaining free of passion and attachment.
('73', 301, 6, 15, 574350) The vital fluid is power and its proper use does not impair brahmacharya; this is the assumption underlying my interpretation.

('73', 302, 7, 12, 575724) Poor Shaukatullah has not yet built up any practice worth the name.
('73', 302, 7, 13, 575792) He has sent all the money he could scrape together.
('73', 302, 7, 14, 575844) And now he has nothing.
('73', 302, 7, 15, 575868) He and Zohra, Dr. Ansaris daughter, were with me for two days.
('73', 302, 7, 16, 575931) Shaukatullah had drafted a reply which I advised him not to send.
('73', 302, 7, 17, 575997) Now I would like you or Polak to find out and tell me what this Education Department is and what is its function.
('73', 302, 7, 18, 576111) Does it help students in distress?
('73', 302, 7, 19, 576146) I am anxious to find the money here.
('73', 302, 7, 20, 576183) But this is a difficult case.
('73', 302, 7, 21, 576213) In any case Harolds studies must not suffer.
('73', 302, 7, 22, 576258) If therefore the Department can make an advance, they should do so in the hope of recovering it from the heirs or Harold himself when he begins to earn.
('73', 302, 7, 23, 576411) If you know Harold and his mother, do please get in touch with them and guide me.
('73', 302, 7, 24, 576493) I am writing to Harold too.
('73', 302, 7, 25, 576521) I have never met the boy.
('73', 302, 7, 26, 576547) Of course I knew nothing of Dr. Ansaris domestic affairs.
('73', 302, 7, 27, 576605) I am sending you the papers Dr. S. has left with me.
('73', 302, 7, 28, 576658) Please return after use.

('73', 303, 3, 4, 576835) DEAR NAWAB SAHEB, Zohra and Shaukat were with me for two days.
('73', 303, 3, 5, 576898) They left yesterday.
('73', 303, 3, 6, 576919) It was distressing to learn from them that they were unable to discharge the obligations left by Dr. Ansari.
('73', 303, 3, 7, 577028) His boy Harold has to finish his education.
('73', 303, 3, 8, 577072) Harolds mother has to be supported.
('73', 303, 3, 9, 577108) This means 35 per month for 3 years at the end of which Harold should finish his education.
('73', 303, 3, 10, 577200) Dr. Ansari has left petty debts amounting to Rs. 12,000. I know the intimate friendship that existed between you and the late Dr. Ansari.
('73', 303, 3, 11, 577338) I know too that you sent some help after Dr. Ansaris death.
('73', 303, 3, 12, 577398) But as Zohra and Shaukat were talking to me I could not help thinking of you and asking you to come to the rescue if it is at all possible for you to do so.
('73', 303, 3, 13, 577555) I hardly need add anything by way of pleading this cause.
('73', 303, 3, 14, 577613) For I know that you had known Dr. Ansari before I had the privilege of knowing him.

('73', 303, 8, 21, 577860) MAHADEV, You do not seem to have got the mail sent form here in the morning by the time you sent the mail from there.
('73', 303, 8, 22, 577978) It contained four letters and a list of medicines for Sushila.
('73', 303, 8, 23, 578041) You did right in not coming.
('73', 303, 8, 24, 578070) When there is no work, you can skip the day.
('73', 303, 8, 25, 578115) The Danish engineer has captivated my heart.
('73', 303, 8, 26, 578160) One does not come across many such frank faces.
('73', 303, 8, 27, 578208) I am sending with this some other letters.
('73', 303, 8, 28, 578251) Skill overhead1 is all right.
('73', 303, 8, 29, 578281) As we reduce overhead charges, we increase over head

('73', 304, 7, 7, 578689) KANTI, I hope you reached there safely and are not worrying.
('73', 304, 7, 8, 578750) It was very good indeed that you came.
('73', 304, 7, 9, 578789) There was a long and fine letter from Saraswati.
('73', 304, 7, 10, 578838) I knew only this time that she could write.
('73', 304, 7, 11, 578882) She seems to feel quite at home with me.
('73', 304, 7, 12, 578923) She feels the separation from you a good deal but is trying to bear it.
('73', 304, 7, 13, 578995) Sushila and Arun have arrived.
('73', 304, 7, 14, 579026) Do you not write to Prabhavati?
('73', 304, 7, 15, 579058) Do write.

('73', 304, 13, 21, 579215) MANILAL, I got your letters.
('73', 304, 13, 22, 579244) So far I have not been able to write to you.
('73', 304, 13, 23, 579289) It is now three days since Sushila and Arun arrived here.
('73', 304, 13, 24, 579347) Arun is all the time asking to be taken to Akola.
('73', 304, 13, 25, 579397) We hope he will calm down by and by.
('73', 304, 13, 26, 579434) I understand your anguish.
('73', 304, 13, 27, 579461) Do what you think is proper.
('73', 304, 13, 28, 579490) Con sider calmly all the pros and cons and do what you feel it is best to do.
('73', 304, 13, 29, 579568) Do not worry about things here.
('73', 304, 13, 30, 579600) It is good that Ramdas has come and stayed here for a few days.
('73', 304, 13, 31, 579664) My health, one may say, is quite good.
('73', 304, 13, 32, 579703) Ba also is fine.
('73', 304, 13, 33, 579720) Segaon is rather crowded just now.
('73', 304, 13, 34, 579755) It is difficult to manage in the rainy season.
('73', 304, 13, 35, 579802) There is not sufficient room for sleeping.

('73', 305, 7, 11, 580217) NARANDAS, I have sent something 1 for Harijanbandhu as per your sugges tion.
('73', 305, 7, 12, 580294) It is a good beginning.
('73', 305, 7, 13, 580318) If the atmosphere there is congenial, it would be good to visit the Harijan colony and take up the welfare work.
('73', 305, 7, 14, 580431) But this should be done only if persons other than those already engaged in the spinning yajna volunteer.
('73', 305, 7, 15, 580537) All the activities are likely to fail if only one group tries to conduct them.
('73', 305, 7, 16, 580616) Do not therefore take up anything unless it is supported by your own experience.
('73', 305, 7, 17, 580697) I have merely suggested it for the sake of variety.
('73', 305, 7, 18, 580749) Otherwise, the real object of celebrating Rentia Baras is to concentrate on the charkha alone during this period.
('73', 305, 8, 19, 580863) About Purushottam 3, I will write in my letter to Jamna 4.

('73', 306, 3, 5, 581433) I am in correspondence with Rajaji on the subject of popu larizing Hindi.
('73', 306, 3, 6, 581507) I also have not understood his policy.
('73', 306, 3, 7, 581546) It would not be proper to rush to the Press before understanding his point of view.
('73', 306, 3, 8, 581630) Ministers many certainly be criticized in public, but the criticism should be balanced and well informed.
('73', 306, 3, 9, 581736) No opinion should be formed on the basis of Press reports and, before criticizing, one should seek clarification from the Minister one wishes to criticize.
('73', 306, 3, 10, 581892) The shortcomings which you point out in the behaviour of satyagrahis really exist.

('73', 307, 8, 14, 583367) We must understand that we are servants not masters and we can live here only through the kindness of the villagers.

('73', 308, 5, 9, 584476) No one can be angry by himself.
('73', 308, 5, 10, 584508) Anger can be mastered only where it is generated.

('73', 308, 10, 21, 584952) That letter should not have been published without being shown to Shuaib.
('73', 308, 10, 22, 585026) I have written to him that you must not have seen it at all.
('73', 308, 10, 23, 585087) As far as possible, such letters should not be published without being shown to you.
('73', 308, 10, 24, 585172) You must have now published, without giving Shuaibs name, the facts sent by him.

('73', 309, 1, 6, 585636) 2 I have completely changed the approach.

('73', 309, 7, 17, 586025) KANTI, You must have received my postcard.
('73', 309, 7, 18, 586068) I got your letter.
('73', 309, 7, 19, 586087) It was very good indeed that you did not get angry with Ramachandran.
('73', 309, 7, 20, 586157) If we go deep into the matter we will find nothing over which to get angry with other people.
('73', 309, 7, 21, 586251) And, therefore, how can anyone ever have the right to get angry?
('73', 309, 7, 22, 586316) Is not anger described as a mild form of madness in English?
('73', 309, 7, 23, 586377) And as the Gita says, its root is kama.
('73', 309, 7, 24, 586417) I will keep on writing to Saraswati.
('73', 309, 7, 25, 586454) It will be very good if you concentrate on your studies.

('73', 310, 1, 2, 586825) 389. WHAT IS SARVODAYA?
('73', 310, 2, 3, 586849) SEGAON, July 21, 1938 Sarvodaya is impossible without satyagraha.
('73', 310, 2, 4, 586915) The word satyagraha should be understood here in its etymological sense.
('73', 310, 2, 5, 586988) There can be no insistence on truth where there is no non violence.
('73', 310, 2, 6, 587056) Hence the attainment of sarvodaya depends upon the attainment of non violence.
('73', 310, 2, 7, 587135) The attainment of non violence in its turn depends upon tapascharya.
('73', 310, 2, 8, 587204) Tapascharya, again, should be pure.
('73', 310, 2, 9, 587240) Ceaseless effort, discretion, etc., should form part of it.
('73', 310, 2, 10, 587300) Pure tapascharya leads to pure knowledge.
('73', 310, 2, 11, 587342) Experience shows that although people talk of non violence, many are mentally so lazy that they do not even take the trouble of familiarizing themselves with the facts.
('73', 310, 2, 12, 587511) Take an example.
('73', 310, 2, 13, 587528) India is a poor country.
('73', 310, 2, 14, 587553) We wish to do away with poverty.
('73', 310, 2, 15, 587586) But how many people have made a study of how this poverty came about, what its implications are, how it can be removed, etc.?
('73', 310, 2, 16, 587712) A devotee of non violence, should be full of such knowledge.
('73', 310, 2, 17, 587773) It is the duty of Sarvodaya to create such means and not to enter into controversies.
('73', 310, 2, 18, 587859) Editors of Sarvodaya should forget Gandh ism.
('73', 310, 2, 19, 587905) There is no such thing as Gandhism.
('73', 310, 2, 20, 587941) I have not put anything new before India; I have only presented an ancient thing in a new way.
('73', 310, 2, 21, 588036) I have tried to utilize it in a new field.
('73', 310, 2, 22, 588079) Hence my ideas cannot be appropriately called Gandhism.
('73', 310, 2, 23, 588135) We shall adopt truth wherever we find it, praise it wherever we see it, and pursue it.
('73', 310, 2, 24, 588222) In other words, in every sentence of Sarvodaya, we should catch a glimpse of non violence and knowledge.

('73', 311, 11, 16, 589177) KRISHNACHANDRA, I re read your letter with care.
('73', 311, 11, 17, 589226) I think that my answer should have sufficed.
('73', 311, 11, 18, 589271) The only answer to the question as to when the desire for procreation may be regarded justified is when a couple desires offspring without desiring sexual pleasure.
('73', 311, 11, 19, 589436) This was believed so in the case of Dasharatha.
('73', 311, 11, 20, 589484) The whole process has been given the character of dharma.
('73', 311, 11, 21, 589542) What you write about the mastery over sexual passion is correct.
('73', 311, 11, 22, 589607) My interpretation of  1 is that he who is wholly free from attachment will not kill at all.
('73', 311, 11, 23, 589699) Thus the expression may be regarded as an exaggeration.
('73', 311, 11, 24, 589755) My walking up to Wardha may not be called dharma but it is not adharma either.
('73', 311, 11, 25, 589834) The same is true of the utterance on procreation.
('73', 311, 11, 26, 589884) Now this answers all your doubts.
('73', 311, 11, 27, 589918) If not, put them to me in the form of questions and I shall answer.

('73', 312, 1, 5, 590227) Some are empirical, some rational.
('73', 312, 1, 6, 590262) Such utterances have the same status as every other utterance which means that any saying of mine which is not acceptable to your heart or mind may be totally rejected.

('73', 314, 3, 5, 591949) The decision to go to Malabar also seems to be cracking up.
('73', 314, 3, 6, 592009) After all even for your own work preservation of health is necessary.
('73', 314, 3, 7, 592079) I would request you to go for the sake of Prabhas peace if not for any other reason.
('73', 314, 3, 8, 592164) Her health too is not good.
('73', 314, 3, 9, 592192) But she will automatically improve when you get well.

('73', 314, 9, 16, 592421) I find your case similar to that of a man living in the midst of fire yet pleading to be protected from fire.
('73', 314, 9, 17, 592531) I think you should satisfy your sexual desire through G. 2 This is the way of the world.
('73', 314, 9, 18, 592620) Those who want to be free of passion cannot do so by merely wishing it.
('73', 314, 9, 19, 592692) The wish must be accompanied by incessant effort.
('73', 314, 9, 20, 592742) This is beyond you.
('73', 314, 9, 21, 592762) This is what I feel.
('73', 314, 9, 22, 592783) If your heart indicates another way and you can master your sexual impulses I for one shall be extremely happy.

('73', 315, 7, 12, 593455) 398. HOW NON VIOLENCE WORKS
('73', 315, 8, 13, 593483) A Congress leader said to me the other day in the course of our conversation, How is it that in quality the Congress is not what it used to be in 1920 25 ?
('73', 315, 8, 14, 593639) It has deteriorated.
('73', 315, 8, 15, 593660) Ninety percent of the members are not carrying out the Congress discipline.
('73', 315, 8, 16, 593736) Can you not do something to mend this state of things ? The question is apposite and timely.
('73', 315, 8, 17, 593829) I cant shirk responsibility by saying I am no longer in the Congress.
('73', 315, 8, 18, 593899) I have gone out of it for the purpose of serving it better.
('73', 315, 8, 19, 593959) I know that I still influence the Congress policy.
('73', 315, 8, 20, 594010) As the author of the Congress constitution of 1920. I must hold myself responsible for such deterioration as is avoidable.
('73', 315, 8, 21, 594133) The Congress started with an initial handicap in 1920. Very few believed in truth and non violence as a creed.
('73', 315, 8, 22, 594244) Most members accepted them as a policy.
('73', 315, 8, 23, 594284) It was inevitable.
('73', 315, 8, 24, 594303) I had hoped that many would accept them as their creed after they had watched the working of the Congress under the new policy.
('73', 315, 8, 25, 594431) Only some did, not many.
('73', 315, 8, 26, 594456) In the beginning stages, the change that came over the foremost leaders was profound.
('73', 315, 8, 27, 594542) Readers will recall the letters from the late Pandit Motilal Nehru and Deshbandhu Das reproduced in Young India.
('73', 315, 8, 28, 594655) They had experienced a new joy and a new hope in a life of self denial, simplicity and self sacrifice.
('73', 315, 8, 29, 594758) The Ali Brothers had almost become fakirs.
('73', 315, 8, 30, 594801) As we toured from place to place, I watched with delight the
('73', 316, 0, 1, 594862) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 317
('73', 316, 1, 2, 594912) change that was coming over the Brothers.
('73', 316, 1, 3, 594954) What was true of these four leaders was true of many others whom I can name.
('73', 316, 1, 4, 595031) The enthusiasm of the leaders had infected the rank and file.
('73', 316, 1, 5, 595093) But this phenomenal change was due to the spell of swaraj in one year.
('73', 316, 1, 6, 595164) The conditions I had attached to the fulfilment of the formula were forgotten.
('73', 316, 1, 7, 595243) Khwaja Saheb Abdul Majid even went so far as to suggest that, as the general of the satyagraha army, which the Congress had then become and still is (if only Congressmen realize the meaning of satyagraha), I should have made sure that the conditions were such that they would be fulfilled.
('73', 316, 1, 8, 595533) Perhaps he was right.
('73', 316, 1, 9, 595555) Only I had no such prevision in me.
('73', 316, 1, 10, 595591) The use of non violence on a mass scale and for political purposes was even for myself an experiment.
('73', 316, 1, 11, 595693) I could not therefore dogmatize.
('73', 316, 1, 12, 595726) My conditions were meant to be a measure of popular response.
('73', 316, 1, 13, 595788) They might or might not be fulfilled.
('73', 316, 1, 14, 595826) Mistakes, miscalculations were always possible.
('73', 316, 1, 15, 595874) Be that as it may, when the fight for swaraj became prolonged and Khilafat ceased to be a live issue, enthusiasm began to wane, confidence in non violence even as a policy began to be shaken, and untruth crept in.
('73', 316, 1, 16, 596088) People who had no faith in the twin virtues or the khadi clause stole in, and many even openly defied the Congress constitution.
('73', 316, 1, 17, 596217) The evil has continued to grow.
('73', 316, 1, 18, 596249) The Working Committee has been making some attempt to purge the Congress of the evil but has not been able to put its foot down and risk the loss of numbers on the Congress register.
('73', 316, 1, 19, 596432) I myself believe in quality rather than quantity.
('73', 316, 1, 20, 596482) But there is no such thing as compulsion in the scheme of non violence.
('73', 316, 1, 21, 596554) Reliance has to be placed upon ability to reach the intellect and the heartthe latter rather than the former.
('73', 316, 1, 22, 596664) It follows that there must be power in the word of a satyagraha generalnot the power that the possession of limitless arms gives, but the power that purity of life, strict vigilance, and ceaseless application produce.
('73', 316, 1, 23, 596882) This is impossible without the observance of brahmacharya.
('73', 316, 1, 24, 596941) It must be as full as it is humanly possible.
('73', 316, 1, 25, 596987) Brahmacharya here does not mean mere physical self control.
('73', 316, 1, 26, 597047) It means much more.
('73', 316, 1, 27, 597067) It means complete control over all the senses.
('73', 316, 1, 28, 597114) Thus an impure thought is a breach of brahmacharya; so is anger.
('73', 316, 1, 29, 597179) All power comes from the preservation and sublimation of the vitality that is responsible for creation of life.
('73', 316, 1, 30, 597291) If the vitality is husbanded instead of being dissipated, it is transmuted into creative energy of the highest order.
('73', 316, 1, 31, 597409) This vitality is continuously and even unconsciously dissipated by evil, or even
('73', 317, 0, 1, 597490) 318 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 317, 1, 2, 597532) rambling, disorderly, unwanted thoughts.
('73', 317, 1, 3, 597573) And since thought is the root of all speech and action, the quality of the latter corresponds to that of the former.
('73', 317, 1, 4, 597690) Hence perfectly controlled thought is itself power of the highest potency and can become self acting.
('73', 317, 1, 5, 597792) That seems to me to be the meaning of the silent prayer of the heart.
('73', 317, 1, 6, 597862) If man is after the image of God, he has but to will a thing in the limited sphere allotted to him and it becomes.
('73', 317, 1, 7, 597977) Such power is impossible in one who dissipates his energy in any way whatsoever, even as steam kept in a leaky pipe yields no power.
('73', 317, 1, 8, 598110) The sexual act divorced from the deliberate purpose of generation is a typical and gross form of dissipation and has therefore been specially and rightly chosen for condemnation.
('73', 317, 1, 9, 598289) But in one who has to organize vast masses of mankind for non violent action the full control described by me has to be attempted and virtually achieved.
('73', 317, 1, 10, 598443) This control is unattainable save by the grace of God.
('73', 317, 1, 11, 598498) There is a verse in the second chapter of Gita which freely rendered means.: Sense effects remain in abeyance whilst one is fasting or whilst the particular sense is starved, but the hankering does not cease except when one sees God face to face. 1 This control is not mechanical or temporary.
('73', 317, 1, 12, 598792) Once attained it is never lost.
('73', 317, 1, 13, 598824) In that state vital energy is stored up without any chance of escaping by the innumerable outlets.
('73', 317, 1, 14, 598923) It has been said that such brahmacharya, if it is at all attainable, can be so only by cave dwellers.
('73', 317, 1, 15, 599025) A brahmachari, it is said, should never see, much less touch a woman.
('73', 317, 1, 16, 599095) Doubtless a brahmachari may not think of, speak of, see or touch a woman lustfully.
('73', 317, 1, 17, 599179) But the prohibition one finds in books on brahmacharya is mentioned without the important adverb.
('73', 317, 1, 18, 599277) The reason for the omission seems to be that man is no impartial judge in such matters, and therefore cannot say when he is or is not affected by such contacts.
('73', 317, 1, 19, 599438) Cupids visitations are often unperceivable.
('73', 317, 1, 20, 599482) Difficult though therefore brahmacharya is of observance when one freely mixes with the world.
('73', 317, 1, 21, 599577) it is not of much value if it is attainable only by retirement from the world.
('73', 317, 1, 22, 599656) Anyway, I have practised brahmacharya for over thirty years with considerable success though living in the midst of activities.
('73', 317, 1, 23, 599784) After the decision to lead the life of a brahmachari there was little change in my outward practice, except with my wife.
('73', 317, 1, 24, 599906) In the course of my work among the Indians in South Africa, I mixed freely with women.
('73', 317, 1, 25, 599993) There was hardly an Indian woman in the Transvaal and Natal

('73', 318, 0, 1, 600074) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 319
('73', 318, 1, 2, 600124) whom I did not know.
('73', 318, 1, 3, 600145) They were so many sisters and daughters to me.
('73', 318, 1, 4, 600192) My brahmacharya was not derived from books.
('73', 318, 1, 5, 600236) I evolved my own rules for my guidance and that of those who, at my invitation, had joined me in the experiment.
('73', 318, 1, 6, 600349) If I have not followed the prescribed restrictions, much less have I accepted the description found even in religious literature of woman as the source of all evil and temptation.
('73', 318, 1, 7, 600529) Owing as I do all the good there may be in me to my mother, I have looked upon woman never as an object for satisfaction of sexual desire but always with the veneration due to my own mother.
('73', 318, 1, 8, 600720) Man is the tempter and aggressor.
('73', 318, 1, 9, 600754) It is not woman whose touch defiles man but he is often himself too impure to touch her.
('73', 318, 1, 10, 600843) But recently a doubt has seized me as to the nature of the limitation that a brahmachari or brahmacharini should put upon himself or herself regarding contacts with the opposite sex.
('73', 318, 1, 11, 601026) I have set limitations which do not satisfy me.
('73', 318, 1, 12, 601074) What they should be I do not know.
('73', 318, 1, 13, 601109) I am experimenting.
('73', 318, 1, 14, 601129) I have never claimed to have been a perfect brahmachari of my definition.
('73', 318, 1, 15, 601203) I have not acquired that control over my thoughts that I need for my researches in non violence.
('73', 318, 1, 16, 601300) If my non violence is to be contagious and infectious, I must acquire greater control over my thoughts.
('73', 318, 1, 17, 601404) There is perhaps a flaw somewhere which accounts for the apparent failure of leadership adverted to in the opening sentence of this writing.
('73', 318, 1, 18, 601545) My faith in non violence remains as strong as ever.
('73', 318, 1, 19, 601597) I am quite sure that not only should it answer all our requirements in our country, but that it should, if properly applied, prevent the bloodshed that is going on outside India and is threatening to overwhelm the Western world.
('73', 318, 1, 20, 601826) My aspiration is limited.
('73', 318, 1, 21, 601852) God has not given me the power to guide the world on the path of non violence.
('73', 318, 1, 22, 601931) But I have imagined that he has chosen me as His instrument for presenting non violence to India for dealing with her many ills.
('73', 318, 1, 23, 602060) The progress already made is great.
('73', 318, 1, 24, 602096) But much more remains to be done.
('73', 318, 1, 25, 602130) And yet I seem to have lost the power to evoke the needed response from Congressmen in general.
('73', 318, 1, 26, 602226) It is a bad carpenter who quarrels with his tools.
('73', 318, 1, 27, 602277) It is a bad general who blames his men for faulty workmanship.
('73', 318, 1, 28, 602340) I know I am not a bad general.
('73', 318, 1, 29, 602371) I have wisdom enough to know my limitations.
('73', 318, 1, 30, 602416) God will give me strength enough to declare my bankruptcy if such is to be my lot.
('73', 318, 1, 31, 602499) He will perhaps take me away when I am no longer wantedfor the work which I have been permitted to do for nearly half a century.
('73', 318, 1, 32, 602628) But I do entertain the hope that there is yet work for me to do, that the darkness that seems to have enveloped me will disappear,
('73', 319, 0, 1, 602759) 320 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 319, 1, 2, 602801) and that, whether with another battle more brilliant than the Dandi March or without, India will come to her own demonstrably through non violent means.
('73', 319, 1, 3, 602954) I am praying for the light that will dispel the darkness.
('73', 319, 1, 4, 603012) Let those who have a living faith in non violence join me in the prayer.

('73', 319, 2, 6, 603104) 399. DUTY OF KHADI WEARERS
('73', 319, 3, 7, 603131) July 23, 1938 I have before me several letters, some protesting against the constant rise in the price of khadi, and some piteously appealing to me to show the way to poor middle class people for buying dear khadi.
('73', 319, 3, 8, 603346) The A. I. S. A. exists only for the betterment of the khadi producers, the majority of whom are poor women spinners.
('73', 319, 3, 9, 603463) I hold that the Association cannot be satisfied till every woman who puts in an honest hour in spinning gets one anna per hour.
('73', 319, 3, 10, 603591) We are on the point of reaching half an anna per hour, and if the consumers and the Congress Governments do their duty, the Association expects to give the anna per hour much earlier than most people expect.
('73', 319, 3, 11, 603799) This must mean some rise in the price of khadi, but not a proportionate rise.
('73', 319, 3, 12, 603877) City people should know that ceaseless effort is being made to evoke greater skill among the artisans so that the whole of the increase in the wages may not fall upon khadi.
('73', 319, 3, 13, 604051) Overhead charges are also being constantly reduced.
('73', 319, 3, 14, 604103) Skill overhead increases with experience.
('73', 319, 3, 15, 604145) But sixteen times increase in the wages of spinners cannot all be brought about merely by increased efficiency Therefore some rise in the price of khadi is inevitable with the increase in the wages.
('73', 319, 3, 16, 604344) This is being unequally distributed among the different varieties so that the heaviest rise will take place in the khadi that is purchased by the monied classes.
('73', 319, 3, 17, 604506) Everything that can be done to ease the burden on poor buyers is being done and will be done by the Association.
('73', 319, 3, 18, 604619) But khadi wearers should know that the economics of khadi are different from the ordinary economics which are based on competi tion in which patriotism, sentiment and humanity play little or no part.
('73', 319, 3, 19, 604819) Khadi economics are based on patriotism sentiment and humanity.
('73', 319, 3, 20, 604883) Before the new policy of the Association was laid down, its aim was to cheapen khadi, mostly in disregard of the wages of the
('73', 320, 0, 1, 605009) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 321
('73', 320, 1, 2, 605059) spinners, the most helpless artisans perhaps in the world.
('73', 320, 1, 3, 605118) This con tinued for nearly a decade.
('73', 320, 1, 4, 605155) It was a mistaken ploicy, but the mistake was unconscious and based on faulty reasoning.
('73', 320, 1, 5, 605244) I must take the largest share of the blame for the mistake.
('73', 320, 1, 6, 605304) Khadi wearers had the sole benefit of the mistake.
('73', 320, 1, 7, 605355) Is it right for them to complain when the mistake is being repaired and the spinners are gradually being paid what is their due ?
('73', 320, 1, 8, 605485) The Association has expected hearty co operation from the khadi wearers and I am glad to be able to say that on the whole the increase in the price of khadi has not been resented by them.
('73', 320, 1, 9, 605673) Many consider it a privilege that they are partners in the tardy justice that is being done to the dumb sisters whose need is infinitely greater than that of the wearers of khadi.
('73', 320, 1, 10, 605853) I know that there are many middle class persons who find it difficult to make the two ends meet, and for them every additional anna becomes a problem.
('73', 320, 1, 11, 606004) And they will not spin.
('73', 320, 1, 12, 606028) They have my sym pathy.
('73', 320, 1, 13, 606052) But they cannot have it both ways.
('73', 320, 1, 14, 606087) If they will not spin, they should cut down their requirements or reduce other expenses.
('73', 320, 1, 15, 606176) In this climate we do not need the clothes we use.
('73', 320, 1, 16, 606227) Where there is a will there is a way.
('73', 320, 1, 17, 606265) A correspondent suggests that khadi is mainly supported by the poor middle class, and contends that if the prices are not brought down to the level at which they can buy it, it will not survive me.
('73', 320, 1, 18, 606463) If that is the condition on which alone khadi can live, it deserves to predecease me.
('73', 320, 1, 19, 606549) Happily there is a fallacy behind the argument.
('73', 320, 1, 20, 606597) The question of cheapness mainly affects the city dwellers.
('73', 320, 1, 21, 606657) If all of them, rich and poor, took to khadi, they could hardly use more than ten percent of the possible production of khadi.
('73', 320, 1, 22, 606784) The rest has to be used by the producers themselves who are villagers.
('73', 320, 1, 23, 606855) The question of price does not affect them materially, if at all.
('73', 320, 1, 24, 606921) It is true that khadi has not penetrated the villages to the extent expected.
('73', 320, 1, 25, 606999) During the transition period, therefore, it has to depend upon the patriotic spirit of city dwellers both rich and poor.
('73', 320, 1, 26, 607120) Those who believe in the message of khadi will not consider any price too dear for khadi.
('73', 320, 1, 27, 607210) It is the only real insurance against famine and unemployment.
('73', 320, 1, 28, 607273) Even if India were to be industrialized overnight, much of the unemployment would remain.
('73', 320, 1, 29, 607363) In this country the problem is to find work for a whole nation which has one fourth of her time without occupation.
('73', 320, 1, 30, 607479) If pestilence, poverty and blood shed are to be avoided, there is no remedy but khadi and
('73', 321, 0, 1, 607569) 322 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 321, 1, 2, 607611) other village industries.
('73', 321, 1, 3, 607637) Those who believe in this mission of khadi and who believe also in a living wage being paid to the spinners, will not grudge the increase that has to be made in the price of khadi.
('73', 321, 1, 4, 607818) They may rely upon the Association moving with the utmost caution.
('73', 321, 1, 5, 607885) The past two years experience warrants the hope that the public welcome the increase in the wages that the spinners are receiving.

('73', 322, 3, 4, 609073) AMRITLAL, Since Vasumati has asked for time, you should tell her that you cannot spare more time.

('73', 326, 3, 6, 615726) Here I will have the satisfaction of giving you intelligent treatment.

('73', 328, 9, 23, 619157) Yes, there is one thing.
('73', 328, 9, 24, 619182) Those who go on brushing the gums with a twig and that too without chewing it into a soft brush do cause their gums to recede.
('73', 328, 9, 25, 619309) But this has no connection with the babul juice.

('73', 330, 3, 8, 621073) But I see positive harm in keeping Saraswati in Bangalore without marriage.
('73', 330, 3, 9, 621149) After you get married, Saraswati perhaps may not insist on staying with you and may come to me or go to Trivandrum.
('73', 330, 3, 10, 621265) I am prepared to write to Ramachandran on hearing from you.

('73', 331, 3, 4, 622169) DEAR FRIEND, Though the fullest brahmacharya is unattainable whilst one is in the flesh a very near approach is perfectly possible in my opinion.
('73', 331, 3, 5, 622315) The way to it is yet unexplored.
('73', 331, 3, 6, 622348) So far as I am concerned I am exploring it in the hope of finding it.
('73', 331, 3, 7, 622418) What progress I have made makes me hopeful.
('73', 331, 3, 8, 622462) The sphere of limitations simply means the limits nature has put upon us as fractions of the Divine.
('73', 331, 3, 9, 622563) A fraction is not the whole.
('73', 331, 3, 10, 622592) If a person has as full control as is possible for a human, his willing affects his surroundings.
('73', 331, 3, 11, 622690) I have personal experience of that in several instances.
('73', 331, 3, 12, 622747) It may be argued that correspondence between the willing and the alleged response were mere coincidences.
('73', 331, 3, 13, 622853) For such doubters I have no reply.

('73', 331, 8, 19, 623065) July 30, 1938 An ex professor writes a long letter on my article on higher education 1 from which I take the following relevant extracts :
('73', 331, 9, 20, 623204) There is need for further clarification of your views on higher education as they have appeared in the Harijan of the 9th inst.
('73', 331, 9, 21, 623332) I agree with many of your viewsespecially those regarding the enormity of the damage caused by the foreign medium.
('73', 331, 9, 22, 623447) I also feel that what passes as higher education today contains much brass mistaken for gold.
('73', 331, 9, 23, 623541) I speak from experience as I was a teacher in the line of the so called higher education till very recently.

('73', 332, 1, 2, 623723) your third conclusion about general revenue and claims of higher education and its corollary, viz., that universities should be self supporting, that has left me unconvinced.
('73', 332, 1, 3, 623898) I believe that every country to be a progressive country must have sufficient faicilities for the pursuit of all branches of knowledge not merely chemistry, medicine and engineering, but every kind of knowledgeliterature, philosophy, history, sociology, both abstract and applied.
('73', 332, 1, 4, 624179) All higher pursuits require many facilities which cannot be had without State support.
('73', 332, 1, 5, 624266) A country depending only on voluntary effort for such pursuits is sure to fall behind and suffer.
('73', 332, 1, 6, 624364) It can never hope to be free and be able to maintain that freedom.
('73', 332, 1, 7, 624431) The State must be jealously watchful over the position of higher education in all fields.
('73', 332, 1, 8, 624521) Voluntary effort must be there and we must have our Nuffields and Rockefellers 1. But the State cannot and must not be allowed to remain a silent spectator.
('73', 332, 1, 9, 624678) It must actively come forward to organize, help and direct.
('73', 332, 1, 10, 624738) I wish you to clarify this aspect of the question.
('73', 332, 2, 11, 624789) You say at the end of your article:Under my scheme there will be more and better libraries. I do not find the scheme you speak of in your article, nor am I able to make out how more and better libraries and laboratories will come into being thereunder.
('73', 332, 2, 12, 625042) I am of opinion that such libraries and laboratories must be maintained and so long as donors and voluntary agencies are not coming forward in sufficient numbers, the State cannot divest itself of this responsibility.
('73', 332, 2, 13, 625260) My article is clear enough if the expression definite use mentioned in it is given its extensive meaning.
('73', 332, 2, 14, 625366) I have not pictured a poverty stricken Indian containing ignorant millions.
('73', 332, 2, 15, 625442) I have pictured to myself an India continually progressing along the lines best suited to her genius.
('73', 332, 2, 16, 625544) I do not, however, picture it as a third class or even a first class copy of the dying civilization of the West.
('73', 332, 2, 17, 625657) If my dream is fulfilled, and every one of the seven lacs of villages becomes a well living republic in which there are no illiterates, in which no one is idle for want of work, in which everyone is usefully occupied and has nourishing food, well ventilated dwellings and sufficient khadi for covering the body, and in which all the villagers know and observe the laws of hygiene and sanitation, such a State must have varied and increasing needs, which it must supply unless it would stagnate.
('73', 332, 2, 18, 626152) I can therefore well imagine the State financing all the education my correspondent mentions and much more that I could add.
('73', 332, 2, 19, 626277) And if the

('73', 333, 1, 2, 626533) State has such requirements, surely it will have corresponding libraries.
('73', 333, 1, 3, 626607) What, however, according to my view the State will not have is an army of B.A.s and M.A.s with their brains sapped with too much cramming and minds almost paralysed by the impossible attempt to speak and write English like Englishmen.
('73', 333, 1, 4, 626842) The majority of these have no work, no employment.
('73', 333, 1, 5, 626893) And when they have the latter, it is usually clerkships at which most of the knowledge gained during their twelve years of high school and college is of no use whatsoever to them.
('73', 333, 1, 6, 627073) University training becomes self supporting when it is utilized by the State.
('73', 333, 1, 7, 627151) It is criminal to pay for a training which benefits neither the nation nor the individual.
('73', 333, 1, 8, 627242) In my opinion there is no such thing as individual benefit which cannot be proved to be also national benefit.
('73', 333, 1, 9, 627353) And since most of my critics seem to be agreed that the existing higher education, and for that matter both primary and secondary, are not connected with realitites, it cannot be of benefit to the State.
('73', 333, 1, 10, 627557) When it is directly based on realities and is wholly given through the mother tongue, I shall perhaps have nothing to say against it.
('73', 333, 1, 11, 627691) To be based on realities is to be based on national, i.e., State, requirements.
('73', 333, 1, 12, 627771) And the State will pay for it.
('73', 333, 1, 13, 627802) Even when that happy time comes, we shall find that many institutions will be conducted by voluntary contributions.
('73', 333, 1, 14, 627918) They may or may not benefit the State.
('73', 333, 1, 15, 627957) Much of what passes for education today in India belongs to that category and would therefore not be paid for from the general revenue, if I had the way.
('73', 333, 1, 16, 628111) But the agreement of my critics on the two main points, medium and the realities, cannot lull me to rest.
('73', 333, 1, 17, 628217) They have criticized and tolerated all these many years the existing system.
('73', 333, 1, 18, 628294) Now that the opportunity for reform has come, Congressmen ought to become impatient.
('73', 333, 1, 19, 628379) If the medium is changed at once and not gradually, in an incredibly short time we shall find text books and teachers coming into being to supply the want.
('73', 333, 1, 20, 628535) And if we mean business, in a years time we shall find that we need never have been party to the tragic waste of the nations time and energy in trying to learn the essentials of culture through a foreign medium.
('73', 333, 1, 21, 628747) The condition of success is undoubtedly that provincial languages are introduced at once in Government offices and courts, if the Provincial Governments have the power or the influence over the courts.
('73', 333, 1, 22, 628949) If we believe in the necessity of the reform, we can achieve it in no time.

('73', 334, 2, 3, 629122) [July 30, 1938] With regard to the recent ministerial crisis in C.P., it has been suggested that Dr. Khare was asked to sign a prepared draft containing humiliating admissions.
('73', 334, 2, 4, 629299) I have no hesitation in saying that this suggestion is baseless.
('73', 334, 2, 5, 629364) Dr. Khare accompanied by several members of the Working Committee, came to Segaon on July 25, and after discussion he prepared a statement to be issued to the Press.
('73', 334, 2, 6, 629530) 1 I made corrections and additions to it, but after reading my corrections and additions he changed his mind and said that he would consult his friends and then decide whether to issue it or not.
('73', 334, 2, 7, 629726) In my opinion there was nothing humiliating in it, if only because it contained nothing but facts.
('73', 334, 2, 8, 629825) I hardly think Dr. Khare will dispute this.
('73', 334, 2, 9, 629869) The best thing, however, is for the public to have the statement itself before it.
('73', 334, 2, 10, 629952) I invite Dr. Khare to publish a facsimile of it.
('73', 334, 2, 11, 630001) I have kept no copy of his own with my amendments.
('73', 334, 2, 12, 630052) He took it with him to Nagpur.

('73', 336, 11, 24, 632630) Therefore nothing should be taken by anybody from Segaon.
('73', 336, 11, 25, 632688) Those who have got cholera may be isolated where they are, unless they could be conveniently shifted elsewhere.

Kalelkar, Narhar Athavale, Pandurang Bhurke, Gajanan Dabke, Murlidhar Sabnis and Shripad Joshi had drunk of unfermented palm juice, nira, on July 30 and on July 31 developed symptoms which the Civil Surgeon of Wardha diagnosed as those of cholera.

('73', 343, 11, 24, 642258) August 6, 1938 Press cuttings on the ministerial crisis in C.P. 1 make most
('73', 343, 12, 25, 642334) 1 The crisis in the C. P. Ministry had begun soon after the assumption of office by the ministry headed by N. B. Khare.
('73', 343, 12, 26, 642454) First a minister had made recommendation direct to the Governor concerning the release of certain convicts (see footnote 1, p.
('73', 343, 12, 27, 642581) 178) and later there were differences among ministers leading to tension.
('73', 343, 12, 28, 642655) In April the
('73', 344, 0, 1, 642668) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 345
('73', 344, 1, 2, 642718) instructive reading.
('73', 344, 1, 3, 642739) That the resolution of the Working Committee condemning the action of veteran leader like Dr. Khare would come in for some severe criticism was a foregone conclusion.
('73', 344, 1, 4, 642906) 1 But I was not prepared for the ignorance betrayed by the critics on the functions of the Working Committee.
('73', 344, 1, 5, 643016) Dr. Khare was not only guilty of gross indiscipline in flouting the warnings of the Parliamentary Board, but he betrayed incompet ence as a leader by allowing himself to be fooled by the Governor, or not knowing that by his precipitate action he was compromising the Congress.
('73', 344, 1, 6, 643293) He heightened the measure of indiscipline by refusing the advice of the Working Committee to make a frank confession of his guilt and withdraw from leadership.
('73', 344, 1, 7, 643453) The Working committee would have been guilty of gross neglect of duty if it had failed to condemn Dr. Khares action and adjudge his incompetence.
('73', 344, 1, 8, 643599) I write these lines in sorrow.
('73', 344, 1, 9, 643630) It was no pleasure to me to advise the Working Committee to pass the resolution it did.
('73', 344, 1, 10, 643718) Dr. Khare is a friend.
('73', 344, 1, 11, 643741) He has run to my aid as a physician when quick medical assistance was needed.
('73', 344, 1, 12, 643819) He has often come to me for advice and guidance and has expressed himself to be in need of my blessings.
('73', 344, 1, 13, 643924) I banked on this friendship when, on the 25th ultimo, I appealed to him bravely to stand down and work as a camp follower.
('73', 344, 1, 14, 644047) He himself seemed to be willing but he was badly advised, and not only declined to accept the Working Committees advice but sent a letter instead, questioning the propriety of the whole of the action of the Working Committee in connection with his ill advised and hasty resignation of office and equally hasty formation of a new Cabinet.
('73', 344, 1, 15, 644385) I hope that on mature reflection he would have seen the error of his conduct and taken the action of the Working Committee in a sportsmanlike spirit.
('73', 344, 1, 16, 644535) There is no moral turpitude involved in his action.
('73', 344, 1, 17, 644587) He is a good fighter.
('73', 344, 1, 18, 644609) He is free with his purse in helping friends.
('73', 344, 1, 19, 644655) These are qualities of which anyone may be proud.
('73', 344, 1, 20, 644705) But these qualities need not make the possessor a good Prime Minister
('73', 344, 2, 21, 644775) Congress Parliamentary Committee managed at a meeting at Pachmarhi to resolve these differences and achieve a settlement.
('73', 344, 2, 22, 644897) But Khare did not keep the terms of the settlement and continued to function without consulting the Working Committee or the Parliamentary Committee.
('73', 344, 2, 23, 645047) In order to get rid of certain ministers he submitted his resignation to the Governor and asked the ministers concerned to resign.
('73', 344, 2, 24, 645178) When they refused to oblige, the Governor dismissed them and later invited Khare to form a new ministry.
('73', 344, 2, 25, 645283) 1 The Working Committee condemning the action of Khare held him to be unworthy of holding positions of responsibility in the Congress organization.
('73', 344, 2, 26, 645431) For the text of the resolution, vide Working Committee Resolution on C. P. Crisis
('73', 345, 0, 1, 645513) 346 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 345, 1, 2, 645555) or administrator.
('73', 345, 1, 3, 645573) I would urge him as a friend to work for the time being as a camp follower and give the Congress the benefit of the admitted qualities I have recited.
('73', 345, 1, 4, 645724) If Dr. Khare was impatient of his recalcitrant colleagues he should have rushed, not to the Governor, but to the Working Comm ittee and tendered his resignation.
('73', 345, 1, 5, 645886) If he felt aggrieved by its decision, he could have gone to the A. I. C. C. But in no case could any Minister take internal quarrels to the Governor and seek relief through him without the previous consent of the Working Committee.
('73', 345, 1, 6, 646118) If the Congress machinery is slow moving, it can be made to move faster.
('73', 345, 1, 7, 646191) If the men at the helm are self seekers or worthless, the A. I. C. C. is there to remove them.
('73', 345, 1, 8, 646286) Dr. Khare erred grievously in ignoring or, what is worse, not knowing this simple remedy and rushing to the Governor on the eve of the meeting of the Working Committee to end his agony.
('73', 345, 1, 9, 646472) It is suggested that the men who succeed him are self seekers and incapable, and can make no approach to Dr. Khare in character.
('73', 345, 1, 10, 646601) If they are as they have been portrayed by their critics, they are bound to fail in the discharge of the onerous responsibility they have undertaken.
('73', 345, 1, 11, 646751) But here again the Working Committee has to work within the limits prescribed for it.
('73', 345, 1, 12, 646837) It cannot impose ministers on a province.
('73', 345, 1, 13, 646879) After all they are elected members, and if the party that has the power to elect them chooses to do so, the Working Committee has no authority to interfere so long as they remain under discipline and are not known to be persons unworthy of public confidence.
('73', 345, 1, 14, 647138) But the crisis should surely put the Ministers on their mettle.
('73', 345, 1, 15, 647202) It is up to them to show by their conduct that the charges levelled against them are baseless, and that they are capable of discharging their trust ably and selflessly.
('73', 345, 1, 16, 647371) It speaks well for the impartiality of the Indian Press in that several journals found it necessary to condemn the action of the Working Committee in pronouncing the opinion it did on the part H. E. the Governor of C. P. played during the unfortunate crisis.
('73', 345, 1, 17, 647630) I am not in the habit of hastily judging opponents.
('73', 345, 1, 18, 647682) The criticism of the resolution has left me unconvinced of any injustice done to the Governor by it.
('73', 345, 1, 19, 647783) In estimating his action, time is of the essence.
('73', 345, 1, 20, 647833) In accepting the resignations of Dr. Khare and his two colleagues, in demanding resignations from the other three Ministers, in expecting an immediate answer, in summarily rejecting their explanation and
('73', 346, 0, 1, 648037) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 347
('73', 346, 1, 2, 648087) dismissing them, and for this purpose keeping himself, his staff and the poor Ministers awake almost the whole night, the Governor betrayed a haste which I can only call indecent.
('73', 346, 1, 3, 648267) Nothing would have been lost if instead of accepting Dr. Khares resignation there and then, he had awaited the meeting of the Working Committee which was to meet two days after the strange drama.
('73', 346, 1, 4, 648463) In dealing with a similar crisis the Bengal Governor acted differently from the C. P. Governor.
('73', 346, 1, 5, 648559) Of course, the Governors action conformed to the letter of the law, but it killed the spirit of the tacit compact between the British Government and the Congress.
('73', 346, 1, 6, 648722) Let the critics of the Working Committees action read the Viceroys carefully prepared declaration which, among other declarations, induced the Working Committee to try the office experiment, and ask themselves whether the Governor was not bound to take official notice of what was going on between the Working Committee and Dr. Khare and his colleagues.
('73', 346, 1, 7, 649076) These indisputable facts lead one to the irresistible conclusion that the Governor, in his eagerness to discredit the Congress, kept a vigil and brought about a situation which he knew was to be uncomfortable for the Congress.
('73', 346, 1, 8, 649303) The unwritten compact between the British Government and the Congress is a gentlemans agreement in which both are expected to play the game.
('73', 346, 1, 9, 649444) The resolution therefore gives English administrators more credit than evidently the critics would give.
('73', 346, 1, 10, 649549) Englishmen are sports men.
('73', 346, 1, 11, 649576) They have ample sense of humour.
('73', 346, 1, 12, 649609) They can hit hard and take a beating also in good grace.
('73', 346, 1, 13, 649666) I have no doubt that the Governor will take the Congress resolution in good part.
('73', 346, 1, 14, 649748) But whether he does so or not, the Working Committee was bound to express what it felt about the Governors action.
('73', 346, 1, 15, 649863) It wishes to avoid a fight if it can; it will take it up if it must.
('73', 346, 1, 16, 649932) If the fight is to be avoided, the Governors must recognize the Congress as the one national organization that is bound some day or other to replace the British Government.
('73', 346, 1, 17, 650105) The U.P., the Bihar and the Orissa Governors waited for the Congress lead when a crisis faced them.
('73', 346, 1, 18, 650205) No doubt, in the three cases, it was obviously to their interest to do so.
('73', 346, 1, 19, 650280) Is it to be said that in C.P. it was obviously to the British interest to precipitate the crisis in order to discomfit the Congress?
('73', 346, 1, 20, 650413) The Working Committee resolution is a friendly warning to the British Government that if they wish to avoid an open rupture with the Congress, the powers that be should not allow a repetition of what happened at Nagpur on the night of the 20th July.
('73', 347, 0, 1, 650663) 348 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 347, 1, 2, 650705) Let us understand the functions of the Congress.
('73', 347, 1, 3, 650754) For internal growth and administration, it is as good a democratic organization as any to be found in the world.
('73', 347, 1, 4, 650867) But this democratic organization has been brought into being to fight the greatest imperialist power living.
('73', 347, 1, 5, 650976) For this external work, therefore, it has to be likened to an army.
('73', 347, 1, 6, 651044) As such it ceases to be democratic.
('73', 347, 1, 7, 651080) The central authority possesses plenary powers enabling it to impose and enforce discipline on the various units working under it.
('73', 347, 1, 8, 651211) Provincial organizations and Provincial Parliamentary Boards are subject to the central authority.
('73', 347, 1, 9, 651310) It has been suggested that, whilst my thesis holds good when there is active war in the shape of civil resistance going on, it cannot whilst the latter remains under suspension.
('73', 347, 1, 10, 651488) But suspension of civil disobedience does not mean suspension of war.
('73', 347, 1, 11, 651558) The latter can only end when India has a Constitution of her own making.
('73', 347, 1, 12, 651631) Till then the Congress must be in the nature of an army.
('73', 347, 1, 13, 651688) Democratic Britain has set up an ingenious system in India which, when you look at it in its nakedness, is nothing but a highly organized efficient military control.
('73', 347, 1, 14, 651854) It is not less so under the present Government of India Act.
('73', 347, 1, 15, 651915) The Ministers are mere puppets so far as the real control is concerned.
('73', 347, 1, 16, 651987) The collectors and the police, who sir them today, may at a mere command from the Governors, their real masters, unseat the Ministers, arrest them and put them in lock up.
('73', 347, 1, 17, 652159) Hence it is that I have suggested that the Congress has entered upon office not to work the Act in the manner expected by the framers but in a manner so as to hasten the day of substituting it by a genuine Act of Indias own coining.
('73', 347, 1, 18, 652392) Therefore the Congress conceived as a fighting machine has to centralize control and guide every department and every Congress man, however highly placed, and expect unquestioned obedience.
('73', 347, 1, 19, 652582) The fight cannot be fought on any other terms.
('73', 347, 1, 20, 652629) They say this is fascism pure and simple.
('73', 347, 1, 21, 652671) But they forget that fascism is the naked sword.
('73', 347, 1, 22, 652720) Under it Dr. Khare should lose his head.
('73', 347, 1, 23, 652761) The Congress is the very antithesis of fascism, because it is based on non violence pure and undefiled.
('73', 347, 1, 24, 652865) Its sanctions are all moral.
('73', 347, 1, 25, 652894) Its authority is not derived from the control of panoplied black shirts.
('73', 347, 1, 26, 652967) Under the Congress regime Dr. Khare can remain the hero of Nagpur, and the students and citizens of Nagpur, and for that matter other places, may execrate me or/and the Working Committee without a hair of the demonstrators heads being touched so long as they remain non violent.
('73', 347, 1, 27, 653246) That is the glory and strength of the Congressnot its weakness.
('73', 347, 1, 28, 653310) Its authority is derived from that non violent attitude.
('73', 348, 0, 1, 653367) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 349
('73', 348, 1, 2, 653417) the only purely non violent political organization of importance, to my knowledge, throughout the world.
('73', 348, 1, 3, 653522) And let it continue to be the boast of the Congress that it can command the willing and hearty obedience from its followers, even veterans like Dr. Khare, so long as they choose to belong to it.

('73', 349, 6, 13, 655437) Therefore we must never clean the untensils where we spit or wash our soiled hands.
('73', 349, 6, 14, 655521) 2. We should not use water direct from the tap as it wastes water and not many poeple can use the tap at the same time.
('73', 349, 6, 15, 655641) Therefore everyone must collect the water he needs in a lota.
('73', 349, 6, 16, 655703) 3. No one should brush his teeth at the place meant for washing hands and mouth.
('73', 349, 6, 17, 655784) The teeth must be brushed at a separate place and the mouth rinsed with water from a lota.
('73', 349, 6, 18, 655875) Brushing of the teeth too should be done near a hedge or where people do not happen to walk.
('73', 349, 6, 19, 655968) 4. We should never spit or blow the nose on the paths.

('73', 350, 3, 7, 656295) You can agitate in a peaceful manner for the inclusion of a Harijan in the cabinet, if you are satisfied that among the members of the C.P. Assembly there is a competent Harijan prepared to accept the Congress discipline, enjoying the confidence of the Harijan members and able to shoulder Ministerial responsibility.
('73', 350, 3, 8, 656613) I am sure you will not insist that in every case and irrespective of merit a Harijan must have a place in the C.P. Ministry.

('73', 350, 5, 10, 656769) 450. HARIJANS AND HINDU HOTELS
('73', 350, 6, 11, 656800) The strike of the Hindu hotel owners does credit neither to them, nor to Ahmedabad, nor does it afford protection to Hindusim.
('73', 350, 6, 12, 656927) These hotel owners could close down their hotels if others did not go to their hotels because of the presence of Harijans there.
('73', 350, 6, 13, 657056) But resorting to strike is tantamount to preventing the Congress Government from doing justice.
('73', 350, 6, 14, 657152) The question arises whether the Hindus on strike are on the side of the Congress or opposed to it.
('73', 350, 6, 15, 657251) Are they enemies of Hinduism or are they its well wishers?
('73', 350, 6, 16, 657310) If they consider themselves supporters of the Congress, they should lovingly feed Harijans despite having to put up with difficulties.
('73', 350, 6, 17, 657445) If, while doing so, other Hindus stop coming to their restaurants, they should put up with this.
('73', 350, 6, 18, 657542) If all Hindu restaurant owners practise this dharma, other Hindus would either be forced to take advantage of those very restaurants or wholly give up eating in such restaurants.
('73', 350, 6, 19, 657721) In the latter eventuality the restaurant owners should look for a new source of livelihood.
('73', 350, 6, 20, 657813) They should on no account forsake their dharma.
('73', 350, 6, 21, 657861) If they are Congressmenand they should bethey should
('73', 350, 7, 22, 657914) 1 The news item from which this has been extracted is dated August 7. 2 This sentence is from a report in The Hindu, 8 8 1938.
('73', 350, 8, 23, 658041) 3 The addressee, a Harijan member of the C.P. Congress Committee, had threatened to start a satyagraha if a Harijan was not included in the C.P. Cabinet.
('73', 351, 0, 1, 658195) 352 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 351, 1, 2, 658237) regard untouchability as adharma and, if that is so, it is evident that by resorting to strike they are practising adharma.
('73', 351, 1, 3, 658361) This strike indicates that the ordinary mass of Hindus share the opinion on the restaurant owners.
('73', 351, 1, 4, 658460) If that is so they are opposed to the Congress.
('73', 351, 1, 5, 658508) But that cannot be so, because Ahmedabad has always sided with the Congress.
('73', 351, 1, 6, 658585) How can they not be convinced that the practice of untouchability cannot survive in this age?
('73', 351, 1, 7, 658679) Akha Bhagat has taught us that untouchability is a superfluous appendage and the cutting off of such a limb is beneficial.
('73', 351, 1, 8, 658802) Moreover, today, we find Hindus everywhere eating in all sorts of places.
('73', 351, 1, 9, 658876) Their religion does not come in their way there.
('73', 351, 1, 10, 658925) They frequent Irani restaurants.
('73', 351, 1, 11, 658958) They freely visit English hotels.
('73', 351, 1, 12, 658992) There is no prejudice against Harijans in those places.
('73', 351, 1, 13, 659048) If Harijans put on the caste mark on their foreheads, wear beads and go to restaurants without proclaiming their caste, who can prevent them?
('73', 351, 1, 14, 659190) How can one find out about their caste?
('73', 351, 1, 15, 659230) There is no doubt that many Harijans go to restaurants in this way.
('73', 351, 1, 16, 659298) Is the strike then merely for the crime which the Government has committed in issuing the order to enforce its own law?
('73', 351, 1, 17, 659418) If those who regard untouchability as their dharma actually wish to put it into practice, they should stop going to restaurants, taking foreign medicines; they should refrain from eating sweets whether foreign or Indian, as there is every possibility of Harijans having had a hand in their making.
('73', 351, 1, 18, 659716) Foreign medicines are not made by Hindus and who knows how many Harijans may not have touched them before they reach the consumer?
('73', 351, 1, 19, 659847) Today there are many vaids who do not practise untouchability.
('73', 351, 1, 20, 659910) Is not their medicine polluted?
('73', 351, 1, 21, 659942) And the less said about sweets the better.
('73', 351, 1, 22, 659985) All this is worth considering.
('73', 351, 1, 23, 660016) And those who do so will certainly come to the conclusion that those who practise untouchability should give up many other things.
('73', 351, 1, 24, 660147) And, as that is not possible, they should realize the difficulty involved in it and tolerate the presence of Harijans in restaurants.
('73', 351, 1, 25, 660281) The path of those who regard untouchability as being opposed to dharma is simple.
('73', 351, 1, 26, 660363) If no restaurant owner opens the doors of his restaurant to them these people should start restaurants in whatever way it is possible and lovingly feed those visiting them.
('73', 351, 1, 27, 660536) If anyone feels that Harijans are dirty, that their clothes are unclean, rules of cleanliness applicable to all can be enforced with regard to restaurants.
('73', 351, 1, 28, 660692) Absence of cleanliness is not a monopoly of Harijans alone.
('73', 352, 0, 1, 660752) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 353
('73', 352, 1, 2, 660802) A few words about the duties of the Government.
('73', 352, 1, 3, 660850) So long as public opinion is in favour of the Congress, the dharma of the latter is clear.
('73', 352, 1, 4, 660941) On no account will it tolerate untouchability.
('73', 352, 1, 5, 660988) It will sink or swim with Harijans.
('73', 352, 1, 6, 661024) Even if the Congress can rule over the entire world by doing injustice to Harijans, it should regard it as dirt.
('73', 352, 1, 7, 661137) Abolition of untouchability is an indispensable part of Congress policy.
('73', 352, 1, 8, 661210) If no one starts a restaurant which would be open to all, either the municipality or the Government should run such places as required at its own expense.
('73', 352, 1, 9, 661365) If such a restaurant does not find enough customers it could be closed down.
('73', 352, 1, 10, 661442) But not a single Hindu restaurant should be allowed to function which does not permit the entry of Harijans.
('73', 352, 1, 11, 661551) Now a few words to the Harijans.
('73', 352, 1, 12, 661584) Just as Congressmen and sanatanist Hindus have to practise their dharma, so have the Harijans.
('73', 352, 1, 13, 661679) These men and women have to see to it that they do not lose the game which is almost theirs.
('73', 352, 1, 14, 661772) I have before me letters written by some proven Harijan workers.
('73', 352, 1, 15, 661837) In these they have mentioned that at some places either in order to show their enthusiasm or to show their gratitude towards the Government, or for some other reason, Harijans, in large numbers, had surrounded restaurants and attempted to enter them.
('73', 352, 1, 16, 662088) They were not even properly dressed.
('73', 352, 1, 17, 662125) Those who do so render no service to Harijans but rather do them harm.
('73', 352, 1, 18, 662196) They misuse laws laid down by the Government.
('73', 352, 1, 19, 662242) Some rights are such that they cannot be utilized fully as soon as they are given.
('73', 352, 1, 20, 662325) Some time must elapse before they are fully enjoyed and we should patiently put up with it.
('73', 352, 1, 21, 662417) This right to enter restaurants is of this nature.
('73', 352, 1, 22, 662468) Not a single Harijan must visit them to assert a right.
('73', 352, 1, 23, 662524) Any Harijan who is really hungry and is passing by a restaurant, who has the money and is clad in clean clothes, should certainly go to the restaurant.
('73', 352, 1, 24, 662676) He should suffer any insult which he encounters while doing so, he should inform the Harijan Sevak Sangh of this without taking any offence and the latter will certainly take steps to ensure that he is not insulted again.
('73', 352, 1, 25, 662898) And, finally, if steps outside of the law prove to be futile, he will resort to legal help.
('73', 352, 1, 26, 662990) The statement made by Shri Muldas in this connection is very useful.
('73', 352, 1, 27, 663059) Harijan men and women will see it published in the current issue and I hope that they will put it into practice.

('73', 353, 12, 21, 664468) Their judgment went in favour of Sardar Patel.

('73', 354, 3, 5, 664718) The one about Shan karacharya seems unnecessary.
('73', 354, 3, 6, 664767) The argument does not sound convincing.
('73', 354, 3, 7, 664807) The other about the Manusmriti is rather imaginative.
('73', 354, 3, 8, 664861) It makes pleasant reading but it does not help much in understanding the meaning of the Smritis.
('73', 354, 3, 9, 664958) What would you suggest?
('73', 354, 3, 10, 664982) How is Dudhibehn?
('73', 354, 3, 11, 665000) How is the childrens education going on?
('73', 354, 3, 12, 665041) How is their health?

('73', 354, 9, 21, 665353) Even though the doctor has given permission, let Kaka start eating gra dually.
('73', 354, 9, 22, 665432) Do not give him plum water.

('73', 360, 12, 21, 674132) The practicability of Mr. Kallenbachs sugges tion will depend on my ability to send teachers from here.

('73', 360, 12, 23, 674253) It is difficult to get teachers who would satisfy me.
('73', 360, 12, 24, 674307) Even if I come across such a teacher, he would have to be paid a salary which we cannot afford.
('73', 360, 12, 25, 674403) Thus whatever arrangement you think of making will have to be made locally.

('73', 360, 12, 27, 674546) So I have to think only about I. O. 1 If the people there give a clear guarantee to make good the loss, not oral but such as will satisfy the bankers, then it is your duty to keep it going.
('73', 360, 12, 28, 674736) If Rustomjee Trust offers some help, there is no harm in accepting it.
('73', 360, 12, 29, 674807) But I would like only direct help from the people.

('73', 361, 0, 1, 674875) 362 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 361, 1, 2, 674917) If the I. O. can be kept going, Sushila must return there.
('73', 361, 1, 3, 674976) I think that essential for helping you as also for her and your peace of mind.
('73', 361, 1, 4, 675055) Sushilas presence by your side will by itself be a source of comfort, such as you cannot have from anything else.
('73', 361, 1, 5, 675169) I feel that if Sushila goes there, Arun should accompany her and Sita should stay here.
('73', 361, 1, 6, 675257) Both of you should learn to bear such sepa ration.
('73', 361, 1, 7, 675308) I am considering here only the welfare of the children.
('73', 361, 1, 8, 675364) In case Sushila goes there, you should treat Phoenix as your home and stay there.
('73', 361, 1, 9, 675446) You should overcome your desire of coming over here too often.
('73', 361, 1, 10, 675509) It is, of course, a different thing if you get an unsought opportunity of coming.
('73', 361, 1, 11, 675591) You should overcome the desire to see your elders.
('73', 361, 1, 12, 675642) If separation from ones people is ones dharma, one must cheerfully abide by that dharma.
('73', 361, 1, 13, 675731) Today this is enough.
('73', 361, 1, 14, 675753) The other news Sushila may give if she wishes and knows how to.
('73', 361, 1, 15, 675817) If Ramdas can be tempted to stay there, then there is nothing better than that.
('73', 361, 1, 16, 675897) In that case the children of both of you should also be trained to look after the work there.
('73', 361, 1, 17, 675991) About Hanna also, whatever Sushila may write.

('73', 363, 11, 21, 678422) So leaving the patients at Gods mercy and yours, I have sent her to the hospital crying.

('73', 367, 10, 32, 684239) Nobody wants to help Harold except Shaukat and Dr. Ansaris daughter Zohra.

('73', 368, 3, 7, 684587) SEGAON, August 12, 1938
('73', 368, 4, 8, 684611) SURU, You are nothing but crazy.
('73', 368, 4, 9, 684644) What a letter you write !
('73', 368, 4, 10, 684670) You are calm one day and agitated for the next several days.
('73', 368, 4, 11, 684731) If you continue thus it will ruin your life as well as Kantis.
('73', 368, 4, 12, 684794) Everything can be accomplished by patience only.
('73', 368, 4, 13, 684843) If you give up patience you will ruin everything.
('73', 368, 4, 14, 684893) So, if you will but listen to me, you will compose yourself and get well.
('73', 368, 4, 15, 684967) How can even I be of any help to you in your agitated state?
('73', 368, 4, 16, 685028) I do want you to see Kanti soon but not by straying from the path of dharma, not by straying from propriety.
('73', 368, 4, 17, 685137) Now, what would you like to do?
('73', 368, 4, 18, 685169) Get well quickly.
('73', 368, 4, 19, 685187) Get rid of the dysentery.
('73', 368, 4, 20, 685213) Your letter this time has caused me considerable pain.

('73', 368, 6, 23, 685374) 484. IS VIOLENCE CREEPING IN?
('73', 368, 7, 24, 685404) Mahadev has passed on to me information containing com plaints about violence being done by Congressmen.
('73', 368, 7, 25, 685509) One complaint is that, in the name of peaceful picketing, picketers are resorting to methods bordering on violence, such as making a living wall beyond which no one can pass without being hurt or hurting those who make the wall.
('73', 368, 7, 26, 685738) As the author of peaceful picketing I cannot recall a single instance in which I had encouraged such picketing.
('73', 368, 7, 27, 685850) A friend has quoted Dharasana against me.
('73', 368, 7, 28, 685892) I had suggested the occupation of salt works.
('73', 368, 7, 29, 685938) But that is wholly inapplicable to the case under consideration.
('73', 368, 7, 30, 686003) In Dharasana the objective was the salt works of which possession had to be taken and maintained as against the Government.
('73', 368, 7, 31, 686127) The action could hardly be called picketing.
('73', 368, 7, 32, 686172) But to prevent workers from going
('73', 369, 0, 1, 686206) 370 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 369, 1, 2, 686248) to their work by standing in front of them is pure violence and must be given up.
('73', 369, 1, 3, 686330) The owners of mills or other factories would be fully justified in invoking the assistance of the police and a Congress Government would be bound to provide it if the Congressmen concerned would not desist.
('73', 369, 1, 4, 686537) Another instance brought to my notice is that of a body of Congressmen having taken possession of the offices of a Congress Committee recognized by the Provincial Congress Committee.
('73', 369, 1, 5, 686720) This is surely unpardonable unruliness.
('73', 369, 1, 6, 686760) The third instance is that of breaking up meetings by shouting and otherwise creating disturbances.
('73', 369, 1, 7, 686860) The fourth is that of reviling capitalists as a class and inciting people to loot them.
('73', 369, 1, 8, 686948) All these are clear instances of violence and indiscipline.
('73', 369, 1, 9, 687008) I am told that such unruliness is on the increase.
('73', 369, 1, 10, 687059) I have before me a letter which bitterly complains that whereas capitalists used to get justice during the old regime, now under the Congress regime they not only get no justice but are even insulted and humiliated.
('73', 369, 1, 11, 687275) There can be no doubt that the British system favours capi talism.
('73', 369, 1, 12, 687342) The Congress, which aims at securing full justice for the famishing millions, cannot favour capitalism.
('73', 369, 1, 13, 687446) But the Congress, so long as it retains non violence as its basic policy, cannot resort to usurpation, much less allow any class of persons to be insulted or humiliated in any way whatsoever or allow any Congressman or a body of Congressmen to take the law into their own hands.
('73', 369, 1, 14, 687725) Nor can the Congress tolerate violent picketing or speeches inciting to violence.
('73', 369, 1, 15, 687807) If violence is not checked in time, the Congress will go to pieces purely from internal decay.
('73', 369, 1, 16, 687902) It is up to the heads of provincial and subordinate committees to root out the evil without the least delay.
('73', 369, 1, 17, 688011) If on the other hand Congressmen in general are tired of non violence, the sooner the first article of the constitution is revised the better it will be for all concerned and the country.
('73', 369, 1, 18, 688199) Let it not be said of the great organization that it used truth and non violence as a cloak to cover untruth and violence.

('73', 370, 1, 2, 688391) 485. TWISTING OR INTERPRETING?
('73', 370, 2, 3, 688422) A friend writes a long letter with reference to my article on Speakers and Politics.
('73', 370, 2, 4, 688507) 2 What is discussed in the letter can be put thus in the form of a question: When you say that the language of the Government of India Act should be stretched to the farthest limit, so as to give the greatest strength to the movement for Independence, do you imply that the Speaker should, or can, knowingly twist any section of the Act so as to give it the desired meaning?
('73', 370, 2, 5, 688882) I should be surprised if such an implication could be extracted from my article.
('73', 370, 2, 6, 688963) It will amount to encouraging untruth.
('73', 370, 2, 7, 689002) A Speaker who knowingly gives an interpretation contrary to the plain meaning of a text, renders himself unfit for the high office and discredits the Congress cause.
('73', 370, 2, 8, 689168) He must, at all cost, preserve the Congress credit for honesty and integrity.
('73', 370, 2, 9, 689246) What, however, I have meant is that where a section is manifestly capable of two meanings or more, he is bound to give that which favours the national cause.
('73', 370, 2, 10, 689404) And when a section bears only one meaning which is manifestly restrictive of the peoples liberty, he must unhesitatingly give that meaning.
('73', 370, 2, 11, 689544) I have no doubt that such impartiality on the part of a Speaker will enhance his reputation and to the extent increase the moral prestige of the Congress.
('73', 370, 2, 12, 689699) Having discarded violence, the strength of the Congress depends wholly upon the moral fibre and fearlessness of individual Congressmen.

('73', 372, 14, 21, 692232) I get a good deal of it, of course, through silence.

('73', 373, 13, 24, 693353) GANDHIJI: I am exceedingly sorry to receive you when I am in distress.
('73', 373, 13, 25, 693424) I may not break my silence even to speak to you.
('73', 373, 13, 26, 693473) But of course you will say whatever you want to.
('73', 373, 13, 27, 693522) You may speak, I may not.
('73', 373, 13, 28, 693548) Tao explained that he was a member of the Peoples Council of Action of all China.
('73', 373, 13, 29, 693630) This was a body of 140 or 150 drawn from all parties in China, under which the whole of China was united to meet Japanese aggression .
('73', 373, 13, 30, 693765) All parties.
('73', 373, 14, 31, 693778) 1 Extracted from Mahadev Desais Notes.
('73', 373, 14, 32, 693817) Since Gandhiji was observing silence his part of the discussion was conducted in writing.
('73', 373, 14, 33, 693907) 2 Vide Letter to Mahadev Desai, 15 8 1938, from which it would appear that Gandhiji had met Tao before that date.
('73', 374, 0, 1, 694021) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 375
('73', 374, 1, 2, 694071) united in fighting the common danger, under one supreme military command of Chiang Kai shek.
('73', 374, 1, 3, 694164) Tao was happy that a Medical Mission from India was sailing to China as a token of Indias sympathy, and he asked Gandhiji if he had any suggestions to offer in order to fight the war to a successful conclusion.
('73', 374, 2, 4, 694375) G. I do not know that I can throw any light on the problem at the present moment.
('73', 374, 2, 5, 694457) My method is so radical that it is wholly inapplicable to your struggle.
('73', 374, 2, 6, 694530) You cannot all of a sudden change the course of the struggle.
('73', 374, 2, 7, 694592) A nation in arms cannot all at once give up arms and accept non violence as its weapon.
('73', 374, 3, 8, 694680) Tao saw the difficulty and explained that the Chinese had not even time to think, the aggression was so sudden and so unprovoked.
('73', 374, 3, 9, 694810) But he would like to discuss problems of national reconstructions.
('73', 374, 3, 10, 694877) He had given up University work in order to take up peasants education and he was deeply interested in the Wardha Education Scheme.
('73', 374, 3, 11, 695009) What exactly is the core of the Scheme? he asked.
('73', 374, 4, 12, 695059) G. The central fact is some village craft through which the whole of the man or the woman in the child can be drawn out.
('73', 374, 5, 13, 695180) But there was the difficulty of teachers, said Prof.
('73', 374, 5, 14, 695233) Tao, and Gandhiji laughed.
('73', 374, 5, 15, 695260) We had the same difficulty.
('73', 374, 5, 16, 695288) Would you have trained teachers to learn a craft or craftsmen to learn the art of teaching? asked Prof.
('73', 374, 6, 17, 695392) G. The average educated man can be expected easily to master a craft.
('73', 374, 6, 18, 695462) Our craftsmen will require much longer time to acquire the necessary general instruction than an educated man, say like you, can require to learn say, carpentry.
('73', 374, 7, 19, 695624) But, said Prof.
('73', 374, 7, 20, 695640) Tao, our educated man is after fat jobs and money.
('73', 374, 7, 21, 695691) How can he be interested in this?
('73', 374, 8, 22, 695725) G. If the scheme is sound and appeals to the educated mind, it must prove attractive in itself and thus wean the educated youth from the lure of gold.
('73', 374, 8, 23, 695876) It must fail, if it does not evoke sufficient patriotism from the educated youth.
('73', 374, 8, 24, 695958) There is one advantage with us.
('73', 374, 8, 25, 695990) Those who have received instruction through the Indian languages cannot enter colleges.
('73', 374, 8, 26, 696078) It is just possible that they will find the scheme attractive.
('73', 374, 9, 27, 696141) Tao was deeply interested in our present political struggle.
('73', 374, 9, 28, 696202) How were we going to acquire power at the centre?
('73', 374, 9, 29, 696252) G. If we are true to our salt in the seven provinces, the accession of strength that will come to us will put us on the way to power at the centre.

('73', 375, 0, 1, 696492) 376 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 375, 1, 2, 696534) G. The Congress prestige has risen.
('73', 375, 1, 3, 696570) The people have become conscious of their power and strength.
('73', 375, 1, 4, 696632) The Government also recog nize this.
('73', 375, 1, 5, 696669) My fear is that this power may throw us off our balance.
('73', 375, 2, 6, 696726) Tao reverted to the question of mass education.
('73', 375, 2, 7, 696774) He made an attempt to
('73', 375, 3, 8, 696796) describe the Chinese system of relay teachers whereby each man or woman who had
('73', 375, 4, 9, 696876) learnt something had to pass it on to the next one he or she came across.
('73', 375, 4, 10, 696950) Even the
('73', 375, 5, 11, 696959) child, the little teacher, had to share his or her learning with his illiterate parents,
('73', 375, 6, 12, 697048) and the Chinese through this system were liquidating illiteracy and ignorance on a
('73', 375, 7, 13, 697131) mass scale.
('73', 375, 8, 14, 697143) G. I have no doubt that it can.
('73', 375, 8, 15, 697175) I would like you to write for me a short note on how the relay teachers and the little teachers are taught, how they teach and with what result.
('73', 375, 9, 16, 697320) Tao said he would gladly comply.
('73', 375, 10, 17, 697353) Tao would not go without a message from Gandhiji for the people of
('73', 375, 11, 18, 697420) He explained that even a non violent message would be welcome .
('73', 375, 12, 19, 697484) were engaged in a war of self defence, but in other respects they were observing non 
('73', 375, 13, 20, 697570) violence .
('73', 375, 13, 21, 697581) On May 20 Chinese planes had flown over Japanese towns, and they
('73', 375, 14, 22, 697646) might easily have spread death and destruction among the people of Japan in
('73', 375, 15, 23, 697722) retaliation for the bombing of so many Chinese ports by Japan.
('73', 375, 15, 24, 697785) But instead of
('73', 375, 16, 25, 697800) raining bombs they rained handbills and leaflets showing the wrong of the war .
('73', 375, 17, 26, 697880) G. But the self inflicted restraint wont last when the real stress comes.
('73', 375, 17, 27, 697954) The temptation will be irresistible.
('73', 375, 17, 28, 697991) I shall not be surprised.
('73', 375, 17, 29, 698017) It is inevitable.
('73', 375, 17, 30, 698035) There is no love in war.
('73', 375, 17, 31, 698060) We have got to come to the conclu sion that either there is to be complete non violence or undiluted violence.
('73', 375, 17, 32, 698171) Is not this enough message?
('73', 375, 18, 33, 698199) Tao wondered if some day the Chinese might expect to have Gandhiji in
('73', 375, 19, 34, 698269) their midst.
('73', 375, 20, 35, 698282) G. I almost came to your country when those who had invited me had to stop me from going owing to the disturbances that had taken place.
('73', 375, 20, 36, 698419) I do want to see peace reigning in your land during my lifetime.
('73', 375, 20, 37, 698484) Nothing will please me better than to visit your great country some day.

('73', 376, 11, 20, 699672) But one good sign is that, though today is Monday, he took mosambi and lime juice.

('73', 381, 11, 18, 706205) SEGAON, August 17, 1938 MY DEAR IDIOT, It was difficult to part with you in the state you were.
('73', 381, 11, 19, 706301) At the time of writing Pyarelal is not quite what he was yesterday.
('73', 381, 11, 20, 706369) He had a restless night.
('73', 381, 11, 21, 706394) But deep down in me there is the faith that he will pull through.
('73', 381, 11, 22, 706460) Shuaib Qureshi came the same time you went, by the same train.
('73', 381, 11, 23, 706523) You left your glasses and some papers which I enclose here with.
('73', 381, 11, 24, 706588) Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I am keeping the glasses with me.
('73', 381, 11, 25, 706662) I hope you will keep well there.
('73', 381, 11, 26, 706695) Do not overstrain yourself.
('73', 381, 11, 27, 706723) Have no anxiety about the mission.
('73', 381, 11, 28, 706758) I am well.
('73', 381, 11, 29, 706769) The diet and silence continue.
('73', 381, 11, 30, 706800) the silence gives me the peace I need.

('73', 382, 3, 6, 707171) As an antidote, I am sen ding the whole bhajan from which I had sent one line to Lilavati.
('73', 382, 3, 7, 707262) To me that bhajan has given great comfort.
('73', 382, 3, 8, 707305) My opinion about the Rifle Club is this: seek the opinion of the Working Committee about this matter.
('73', 382, 3, 9, 707407) I think we cannot refuse the request outright.
('73', 382, 3, 10, 707454) Licences may be given to all those who submit to rules and regulations.
('73', 382, 3, 11, 707526) The Congress Government will not bear the expenses.

('73', 383, 9, 23, 708992) Right now I have only one wish: not to entertain any thought, utter any word, write any sentence, that may hurt you.

('73', 386, 10, 29, 712764) What service can he ask of you?
('73', 386, 10, 30, 712796) He does not accept much service from anyone except Sushila.

('73', 386, 10, 32, 712917) But it is Sushila who does the real nursing.
('73', 386, 10, 33, 712962) They are a wonderful pair, the brother and sister.
('73', 386, 10, 34, 713013) I have not seen their like anywhere.

('73', 387, 7, 14, 713839) MANILAL, I have only sent you my opinion 3 .
('73', 387, 7, 15, 713884) If you get 200 subscribers who would pay 25 each or 100 who would pay 50 each, and if you get an assurance regarding the I. O. expenses and do not have to go about for collections, you ought to stay on there.
('73', 387, 7, 16, 714093) You should increase your efficiency.
('73', 387, 7, 17, 714130) If you become steady there, Sushila and Arun may go there and Sita may stay here.
('73', 387, 7, 18, 714212) She seems to be progressing very well in her study at Akola.
('73', 387, 7, 19, 714273) If Sushila goes there, you will of course get help and also peace of mind.
('73', 387, 7, 20, 714348) I do feel that, when Sushila is living near me, I am observing silence and so cannot train her or get her trained as I should like to do.
('73', 387, 7, 21, 714486) Moreover, as I take my meals by myself, I cannot watch what she and Arun eat.
('73', 387, 7, 22, 714564) If I were in better shape, Sushilas swollen body and Aruns weak one also would certainly have improved.
('73', 387, 7, 23, 714668) But what can we do?
('73', 387, 7, 24, 714688) She can receive from me only as much as her fate permits.
('73', 387, 7, 25, 714746) She can be said to have been freed from my clutches.
('73', 387, 7, 26, 714799) It is no easy thing to get caught in my clutches.
('73', 387, 7, 27, 714849) Well, Gods will prevails in all things.
('73', 387, 7, 28, 714889) Just now Pyarelal is confined to bed.

('73', 387, 7, 31, 714989) He is being nursed carefully, of course.

('73', 389, 12, 24, 717871) August 20, 1938
('73', 389, 13, 25, 717887) The statement that the handloom industry has defied mill competition is only partially true.
('73', 389, 13, 26, 717980) There are not today half as many handloom weavers as there were, say, twenty five years ago.
('73', 389, 13, 27, 718073) There was a time when, as the spinning wheel spun the whole of the yarn
('73', 389, 14, 28, 718145) 1 From the reference to Nana Dharmadhikari in the preceding item.
('73', 389, 14, 29, 718211) 2 The letter was signed by Kanu Gandhi, under instructions from Gandhiji.
('73', 389, 14, 30, 718285) 3 From the reference to rakhi in the letter of August 19 to the addressee.
('73', 390, 0, 1, 718360) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 391
('73', 390, 1, 2, 718410) required by the nation, the handloom wove all the cloth required.
('73', 390, 1, 3, 718476) When the mills were established the spinning wheel all but died out for the very simple reason that it gave a paltry return and was never a whole time occupation.
('73', 390, 1, 4, 718639) But the loom offered stubborn resistance, for the reason, among others, that it was a full time occupation by itself and paid the weaver enough to eke out a living.
('73', 390, 1, 5, 718804) When the spinning mill came, the weaver fell back upon it for his hanks of yarn.
('73', 390, 1, 6, 718885) He even welcomed the change because he could get more evenly spun and stronger yarn.
('73', 390, 1, 7, 718970) Little did he know that he was to become perfectly helpless if the mills for any reason could not supply him with yarn.
('73', 390, 1, 8, 719090) Unlike the village spinner the millowner dictated the price of his yarn.
('73', 390, 1, 9, 719163) By and by the weaver who wove simple patternless khadi could not withstand the mill competition and he died.
('73', 390, 1, 10, 719272) And for the past few years the weaver of fancy cloth has felt the pressure from weaving mills.
('73', 390, 1, 11, 719367) Public taste is slowly but surely changing.
('73', 390, 1, 12, 719411) If the mills cannot exactly copy the patterns woven by the village weaver, they can, as they do, produce new patterns and by efficient advertising attract customers.
('73', 390, 1, 13, 719577) Therefore several thousand Orissa weavers are idle for want of custom.
('73', 390, 1, 14, 719648) A similar cry came to me the other day from Ahmednagar,a strong weaving centre.
('73', 390, 1, 15, 719728) My advice to them all was that if these weaving families would but introduce carding and spinning in their homes, they could be wholly independent of mill yarn and enlist the never failing assistance of the A. I. S. A. It might be that the weavers might not earn as much as before because of part of their time being given to spinning.
('73', 390, 1, 16, 720064) But now, under the revised policy of the A. I. S. A. which aims at giving one anna per hour to the spinner and is actually giving one and half pice per hour, the weaver would hardly feel the reduction in his income.
('73', 390, 1, 17, 720280) And in any case a reduced wage is surely better than starvation.
('73', 390, 1, 18, 720345) Let it be borne in mind that the weaver, in introducing spinning and carding in his family, has to go in for very little outlay.
('73', 390, 1, 19, 720474) The wheel he already has.
('73', 390, 1, 20, 720500) It will no doubt require some improvment.
('73', 390, 1, 21, 720542) He has to invest in a carding bow costing a few annas.
('73', 390, 1, 22, 720597) I understand that the Orissa Government is banishing mill yarn from their jails and restricting their cloth purchases to khadi.
('73', 390, 1, 23, 720725) They deserve congratulations for conforming to the constructive pro gramme of the Congress.
('73', 390, 1, 24, 720817) Let the workers in charge of the organiza tion remember the prescription herein suggested, and they will find that production of the yarn required will be the easiest by educating
('73', 391, 0, 1, 720997) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 391, 1, 2, 721039) the weavers to take up spinning.
('73', 391, 1, 3, 721072) They will also by this method pro bably find that khadi can be, comparatively speaking, more cheaply produced than if they were to wait till they trained raw villagers to become efficient spinners.
('73', 391, 1, 4, 721270) No doubt they will have to introduce spinning in all the villages.
('73', 391, 1, 5, 721337) For that is the goal of the A. I. S. A. But they may not neglect the handloom weavers till the high purpose is accomplished.

('73', 391, 3, 8, 721508) August 20, 1938 A telegram says :
('73', 391, 4, 9, 721542) Burma riots deserve more attention than you paid.
('73', 391, 4, 10, 721592) Whatever Govern ment information, no peace till tenth, when I left Rangoon by aeroplane.
('73', 391, 4, 11, 721681) Indians frightfully perturbed.
('73', 391, 4, 12, 721712) They adopted your non violence, suffered terribly.
('73', 391, 4, 13, 721763) Effective steps urgently solicited.
('73', 391, 4, 14, 721799) The step that I took immediately on receipt of a wire from Rangoon was the only effective step I could then take.
('73', 391, 4, 15, 721913) 1 I was not then even in possession of facts.
('73', 391, 4, 16, 721959) Now there is before me a narrative of the cause of the Burmese fury.
('73', 391, 4, 17, 722028) It appears that a Burman wrote a tract in disparagement of Islam some time ago.
('73', 391, 4, 18, 722108) A Burman Buddhist who had become a convert to Islam wrote a counter tract attacking the original and also attacking Buddhism.
('73', 391, 4, 19, 722234) No Indian had a hand in the writing of the counter tract.
('73', 391, 4, 20, 722292) It did not attract notice at once, but the Burmese Press fiercely criticized it and inflamed the Burmese mind.
('73', 391, 4, 21, 722403) The result was the savagery which took many precious, innocent lives and destroyed property worth, it is said, millions.
('73', 391, 4, 22, 722524) Nor was it confined to Rangoon; it spread throughout Burma wherever there were Indian settlers.
('73', 391, 4, 23, 722620) If, as my correspondent says,Indians adopted your (i.
('73', 391, 4, 24, 722674) e., my) non violence, I can only say they suffered less than they would have otherwise done.
('73', 391, 4, 25, 722767) Non violence has no limits.
('73', 391, 4, 26, 722795) If a particular dose does not seem to answer, more should be administered.
('73', 391, 4, 27, 722870) It is a never failing remedy.
('73', 391, 4, 28, 722900) But why call it my non violence?
('73', 391, 4, 29, 722933) Probably the wire is a gentle rebuke to me, so much as to say that my remedy failed.
('73', 391, 4, 30, 723018) The pertinent question is whether they believed in non violence as a sure remedy against violence, or was it undertaken because there was no help for it ?
('73', 391, 4, 31, 723173) I, however, need not wait for a reply.
('73', 391, 4, 32, 723212) If one is to believe the papers,
('73', 391, 5, 33, 723245) 1 Vide Telegram to President, Burma Congress Committee, 5 8 1938
('73', 392, 0, 1, 723310) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 393
('73', 392, 1, 2, 723360) there was not complete non violence practised by the Indians.
('73', 392, 1, 3, 723422) I have, however, no difficulty in believing that a considerable number observed non violence whether from belief or necessity.
('73', 392, 1, 4, 723549) The question for consideration, however, is: what of the future ? There will no doubt be some kind of an inquiry.
('73', 392, 1, 5, 723663) There may be some compensation paid to the losers.
('73', 392, 1, 6, 723714) There would be some punish ment meted out to the offenders who are not likely to be the prime movers but their dupes.
('73', 392, 1, 7, 723832) I must confess that I am uninterested in these proceedings.
('73', 392, 1, 8, 723892) There will be no insurance against future out breaks.
('73', 392, 1, 9, 723946) Indians in Burma should realize that they are at the mercy of the inhabitants of Burma.
('73', 392, 1, 10, 724034) They have no Government in India that can really afford them protection.
('73', 392, 1, 11, 724107) We know what is happening in the other parts of the world; nor is it to be wondered at.
('73', 392, 1, 12, 724195) England will never go to war with any nation or country because it has insulted or wronged Indian settlers in that country.
('73', 392, 1, 13, 724319) It may, it will, make represen tations, sincere of course; it will lodge energetic protests even.
('73', 392, 1, 14, 724417) But there her help will end.
('73', 392, 1, 15, 724446) And in a case like the Burmese riots, the relief that the Government of India can afford will be next to nothing.
('73', 392, 1, 16, 724560) What does it do when riots take place in India itself ?
('73', 392, 1, 17, 724616) It can do very little after they are over.
('73', 392, 1, 18, 724659) The utmost it can do is to take measures to quell riots when they take place.
('73', 392, 1, 19, 724737) What have even Congress Governments been able to do after the riots that have recently taken place in some Congress Provinces?
('73', 392, 1, 20, 724864) They do not admit of relief being granted to the sufferers except in rare cases.
('73', 392, 1, 21, 724945) What is possible in Burma I do not know.
('73', 392, 1, 22, 724986) I am concerned with attainment of permanent peace in so far as permanence is possible in this very impermanent life.
('73', 392, 1, 23, 725103) When once religious animosity is roused, it has a knack of repeating itself with periodic regularity, if radical measures are not adopted by the communities concerned.
('73', 392, 1, 24, 725271) One such measure is cultivation of mutual respect for the several religions professed by the parties.
('73', 392, 1, 25, 725373) If the Buddhists of Burma have little regard for Islam and the Muslims for Buddhism, the seeds of dissension are there.
('73', 392, 1, 26, 725493) They will take little watering to sprout into the savagery such as we saw the other day.
('73', 392, 1, 27, 725582) I would, therefore, suggest a mutual understanding of these great religions.
('73', 392, 1, 28, 725659) My fear is that at the bottom of the riots there is an anti Indian
('73', 393, 0, 1, 725726) 394 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 393, 1, 2, 725768) feeling, due, perhaps to economic causes.
('73', 393, 1, 3, 725810) For though Muslims seem to have suffered most, Hindus too seem to have come in for a fair share of the Burman fury.
('73', 393, 1, 4, 725926) Therefore, Indian settlers must see to it that their dealings with the Burmans are fair and above board.
('73', 393, 1, 5, 726031) It is said that everything is fair in trade, and that no turpitude attaches to a trader taking advantage of his customers ignorance and demanding from him even an unconscionable price for his goods.
('73', 393, 1, 6, 726230) That kind of dealings will surely acerbate feelings.
('73', 393, 1, 7, 726283) Wherever we have gone, even before the British rulers took possession of our country, we have depended solely on the goodwill of those among whom we have lived and with whom we have traded.
('73', 393, 1, 8, 726473) Such is the history of our relations with Zanzibar, Aden, Java, etc.
('73', 393, 1, 9, 726542) Times have however changed.
('73', 393, 1, 10, 726570) The people all over the world have become conscious of their rights.
('73', 393, 1, 11, 726639) Whereas formerly foreign settlers in other lands did questionable things with impunity, they cannot do so now.
('73', 393, 1, 12, 726750) Honesty has never been so much proved to be the best policy as it is now for those who do not or cannot back their dishonesty with gunpowder and poison gas.
('73', 393, 1, 13, 726907) If India is to escape that training and is to adopt, as a free nation, peace as her motto in every walk of life and in every country where her children go, they will have to practise strictest honesty in their human dealings.
('73', 393, 1, 14, 727133) To the Burmese friends one word.
('73', 393, 1, 15, 727166) When I was in Burma some years ago, Burmese priests were good enough to invite me to their conference and honour me with their address under the shadow of the mighty Pagoda.
('73', 393, 1, 16, 727340) They were good enough, as Buddhists, to claim me as one of them.
('73', 393, 1, 17, 727405) It therefore hurt me when I read of the mob fury which knew no distinction of sex or age and wreaked vengeance on persons who could never have had anything to do with the offending pamphlet.
('73', 393, 1, 18, 727596) I have the greatest veneration for the Buddha.
('73', 393, 1, 19, 727643) He is one of the greatest preachers of peace.
('73', 393, 1, 20, 727689) The gospel of the Buddha is gospel of love.
('73', 393, 1, 21, 727733) It passes comprehension how representatives of that faith could give themselves up to savagery, and that on an apparently flimsy pretext.
('73', 393, 1, 22, 727871) The pity of it is that, if the newspaper reports were true, even priests, the repositories of the Buddhas gospel, were to be seen among the mob, not stilling its fury, but actually taking part in loot, arson and murder.
('73', 393, 1, 23, 728091) Would that the wise men among them would do a little heart searching and take steps to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy which all right thinking persons must deplore !

('73', 394, 9, 15, 728646) MY DEAR IDIOT, There must be a wire awaiting me at Maganwadi.
('73', 394, 9, 16, 728708) I heard yesterday that you were to be State Guest.
('73', 394, 9, 17, 728759) I do hope my letter 1 went through all right (or alright ?).
('73', 394, 9, 18, 728820) Pyarelal is decidedly better today.
('73', 394, 9, 19, 728856) The temperature is only 101 against 103 at this time yesterday (8 a.m).

('73', 394, 9, 22, 729049) I had a visit yesterday from the President of the T [ravancorre] National Congress.
('73', 394, 9, 23, 729133) Of course I was silent.
('73', 394, 9, 24, 729157) He is an able man.

('73', 395, 7, 26, 730929) Yes, I have declared myself unworthy.

('73', 398, 10, 19, 734595) August 21, 1938 I realize your regard and support for Dr. Khare, I also have great love for Dr. Khare, but we who are fighting the independence battle have to forget family relations while doing our duty.
('73', 398, 10, 20, 734800) After introspection I found that no wrong or injustice had been done to Dr. Khare.
('73', 398, 10, 21, 734883) You have no material for comparison.
('73', 398, 10, 22, 734920) I myself framed the Congress constitution in 1920 wherein the All India Congress is the final appellate authority which everybody can approach.

('73', 398, 11, 26, 735208) They expressed support for Dr. N. B. Khare and demanded withdrawal of the Working Committees resolution concerning him.
('73', 398, 11, 27, 735328) Since Gandhiji was observing silence he wrote out this reply

('73', 399, 1, 2, 735431) Committee or leaders referred to, if found guilty, deserve punishment.
('73', 399, 1, 3, 735502) I advise you to prepare your case in favour of Dr. Khare to be placed before the A. I. C. C. I have said whatever I wanted to.
('73', 399, 1, 4, 735629) I cannot address a public meeting at seventy.
('73', 399, 1, 5, 735675) I have no desire to prove Dr. Khares guilt, nor do I wish you to lessen your love for Dr. Khare.
('73', 399, 1, 6, 735772) Time alone will tell and Dr. Khare will admit his mistake.
('73', 399, 1, 7, 735831) I have patience.
('73', 399, 1, 8, 735848) If I realize that I did injustice in this case unknowingly, I will apologize.
('73', 399, 1, 9, 735926) I do not wish to win independence through hooliganism which will destroy the Congress if it enters that body.

('73', 399, 1, 11, 736126) No ban was imposed on Dr. Khare for contesting the election of the leadership of the C. P. Assembly Party nor did Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose threaten any member while exercising his right to vote, not did I deprive Dr. Khare of his right to contest the election.
('73', 399, 1, 12, 736386) The Working Committees resolution against Dr. Khare was recommendatory, not mandatory.
('73', 399, 1, 13, 736473) The charge of favouritism against the C. P. Ministry was inquired into, and the wrongs redressed, while the charge of bribery and corruption was not proved.
('73', 399, 1, 14, 736630) The Working Committee can correct its mistake if it has committed any.
('73', 399, 1, 15, 736701) If the members of the Working Committee had the right to attend the party meeting none could remove them.
('73', 399, 1, 16, 736807) It could convene the meeting at Wardha.

('73', 409, 2, 3, 748825) During my student days improperly so called (for they properly began after the period of examinations and are not yet over for me) I learnt a saying of Emersons which I never forgot.
('73', 409, 2, 4, 749008) Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, said the sage.
('73', 409, 2, 5, 749077) I cannot be a little mind, for foolish consistency has never been my hobgoblin.
('73', 409, 2, 6, 749157) My critics are shocked over my recent remarks on picketing.
('73', 409, 2, 7, 749217) They think that in describing as a species of violence the formation of a living wall of pickets in order to prevent the entry of persons into picketed places, I have contradicted my sayings and doings during the civil disobedience campaign.
('73', 409, 2, 8, 749459) If such is really the case, my recent writing must be held as cancelling my comparatively remote sayings and doings.
('73', 409, 2, 9, 749576) Though my body is deteriorating through age, no such law of deterioration, I hope, operates against wisdom which I trust is not only not deteriorating but even growing.
('73', 409, 2, 10, 749745) Whether it is or not, my mind is clear on the opinion I have given on picketing.
('73', 409, 2, 11, 749826) If it does not appeal to Congressmen, they may reject it, and if they do, they will violate the laws of peaceful picketing.
('73', 409, 2, 12, 749950) But there is no discrepancy between my past practice and the present statement.
('73', 409, 2, 13, 750030) When civil disobedience was first orgainzed by me in South Africa, my companions discussed with me the question of picketing.
('73', 409, 2, 14, 750156) The registration office had to be picketed in Johannesburg, and the suggestion made was that we should form there a living wall of pickets.
('73', 409, 2, 15, 750296) I at once rejected the idea as violent.
('73', 409, 2, 16, 750336) And pickets were posted in marked positions in a big public square so that no one could elude the eagle eyes of the pickets and yet everyone could go to the registration office, if he liked, without touching anyone.
('73', 409, 2, 17, 750552) Reliance was put upon the force of public opprobrium which would be evoked by the publication of the names of black legs.
('73', 409, 2, 18, 750674) This method was copied by me here when liquor shops were to be picketed.
('73', 409, 2, 19, 750747) The work was specially entrusted to the women as better representatives of non violence than men.
('73', 409, 2, 20, 750845) Thus there was no question of the formation of a living wall.
('73', 409, 2, 21, 750907) Many unauthorized things were no doubt done during those days as they are now.
('73', 409, 2, 22, 750986) But I cannot recall a single instance in which I countenanced the kind of picketing condemned by the article that has come in for sharp criticism.
('73', 409, 2, 23, 751133) And is there really any difficulty about regarding a living wall of pickets as naked violence ?
('73', 409, 2, 24, 751229) What is the difference between force used against a man wanting to do a
('73', 410, 0, 1, 751301) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 411
('73', 410, 1, 2, 751351) particular thing, and force exercised by interposing yourself between him and the deed ?
('73', 410, 1, 3, 751440) When, during the non co operation days, the students in Benares blocked the passage to the University gates I had to send a peremptory message and, if my recollection serves me right, I strongly condemned their action in the columns of Young India.
('73', 410, 1, 4, 751689) Of course I have no argument against those who hold different views from mine regarding violence and non violence.
('73', 410, 1, 5, 751804) The other inconsistency imputed to me has reference to my advice to factory owners to invoke the assistance of the police to defend themselves against what I have described as violent picketing.
('73', 410, 1, 6, 751999) Having condemned the Ministries for calling in the aid of the police and even the military for suppressing riots, how could I advise employers of labour to ask for, and Ministers to supply, police assis tance, ask my critics.
('73', 410, 1, 7, 752225) This is what I wrote 1 in Harijan about the Ministerial action in U.P.:
('73', 410, 2, 8, 752297) It has been suggested that when we have our independence riots and the like will not occur.
('73', 410, 2, 9, 752389) This seems to me to be an empty hope, if in the course of the struggle for freedom we do not understand and use the technique of non violent action in every conceivable circumstance.
('73', 410, 2, 10, 752572) To the extent that the Congress Ministers have been obliged to make use of the police and the military, to that extent, in my opinion, we must admit our failure.
('73', 410, 2, 11, 752734) That the Ministers could not have done otherwise is unfortunately only too true.
('73', 410, 2, 12, 752815) I should like every Congressman, I should like the Working Committee, to ask themselves why we have failed, if they think with me that we have.
('73', 410, 2, 13, 752959) Surely here there is no condemnation of the Ministers action.I have deplored the necessity for it as I would deplore such necessity in the matter of picketing.
('73', 410, 2, 14, 753119) But till the Congress has developed a peaceful method of dealing with violent crimes, its Ministers must use the police and, I fear, even the military, if they are to undertake the administration of the affairs of the country in the present stage of its career.
('73', 410, 2, 15, 753381) But it will bode ill for them and the country if they do not devise methods of dispensing with the use both of the police and the military or at least of visibly reducing their use to such an extent that he who runs may notice the reduction.
('73', 410, 2, 16, 753623) There certainly is a way.
('73', 410, 2, 17, 753649) I have ventured to give a faint indication of it.
('73', 410, 2, 18, 753699) But it may be that the Congress organization is not really fitted for the great task.
('73', 410, 2, 19, 753785) Without a living faith in non violence, neither the military nor the police can be supplanted.

('73', 411, 7, 11, 754412) August 27, 1938
('73', 411, 8, 12, 754428) VALJI, I read your third article and am returning all the three.
('73', 411, 8, 13, 754493) The idea of composing a new Smriti is a tempting one, but I am not qualified.
('73', 411, 8, 14, 754571) If I assume that I am qualified, I would require the leisure that is posible in jail.
('73', 411, 8, 15, 754657) Outside I have no choice.
('73', 411, 8, 16, 754683) I have to take up the work that comes to me and do it as best as I can.
('73', 411, 8, 17, 754755) There is some freedom of choice in jail.
('73', 411, 8, 18, 754796) If you wish to contribute in the compositon of a new Smriti, you will have to go deep into the thing.
('73', 411, 8, 19, 754898) There are many interpolations in the Smritis.
('73', 411, 8, 20, 754944) Some portions, though not interpolations, deserve to be rejected.
('73', 411, 8, 21, 755010) Even in the Vedas everything contained is not eternal truth.
('73', 411, 8, 22, 755071) The Vedas are a mixture of poetry, history and eternal verities.
('73', 411, 8, 23, 755136) We should try to pick out the last.
('73', 411, 8, 24, 755172) We should formulate rules of interpretation.
('73', 411, 8, 25, 755217) And after that, we may place before the people our interpretations right from the Vedas to the Puranas, as the substance of Hinduism.
('73', 411, 8, 26, 755351) You have got the necessary ability for this, but have I ?
('73', 411, 8, 27, 755409) This task is beyond the ability of a single person.
('73', 411, 8, 28, 755461) For this we should have a group from among ourselves.
('73', 411, 8, 29, 755515) You will now get some faint idea about how my mind is working.
('73', 411, 8, 30, 755578) I do know what is dharma, but I do not know how to put it as the Vedas do.
('73', 411, 8, 31, 755653) I am not sufficiently well versed in the Shastras.
('73', 411, 8, 32, 755704) And the most important thing is that I am not completely free from attachment.
('73', 411, 8, 33, 755783) I aspire to be so in this life.
('73', 411, 8, 34, 755815) But I will not feel sorry if I fail.
('73', 411, 8, 35, 755852) I am using all the strength God has given me to destroy attachment, etc.
('73', 411, 8, 36, 755925) It is not impossible for me to attain to that state, but I do not know whether I have that much time left to me.

('73', 412, 7, 12, 756495) August 27, 1938
('73', 412, 8, 13, 756511) DEVDAS,
('73', 412, 9, 14, 756519) I could not spare the time to reply to you.
('73', 412, 9, 15, 756563) I also have formed the same impression about Khan Saheb that you say you have.
('73', 412, 9, 16, 756642) However, he is so suspicious that one cannot know when he might do what.
('73', 412, 9, 17, 756715) But being a man of God, he remains unharmed by mistakes and perhaps he may live his whole life in this way and remain blameless.
('73', 412, 9, 18, 756844) He suffers from mental lethargy and so does not know what to do in particular circumstances.
('73', 412, 9, 19, 756937) And, moreover, he is simple hearted.
('73', 412, 9, 20, 756974) He would believe everythng that a man whom he has come to trust told him, would not believe anything said by anyone against whom he is prejudiced, and get angry with those that did.
('73', 412, 9, 21, 757156) Even so, he is a saintly person, and so one does not mind his faults.
('73', 412, 10, 22, 757226) Pyarelal has pulled through this time.
('73', 412, 10, 23, 757265) Showing him what you have written would have an adverse effect.
('73', 412, 10, 24, 757329) He is not fit enough just now to bear your jokes and it would not do showing him the letter after it has been edited !
('73', 412, 10, 25, 757448) If his temperature is not normal today, it will be so in a day or two.
('73', 412, 10, 26, 757519) He follows my advice on most things.
('73', 412, 10, 27, 757556) He gives me no trouble, and so you need not worry.
('73', 412, 10, 28, 757607) My silence has benefited me so much that if and when I have to give it up, I shall find it hard to
('73', 413, 0, 1, 757706) 414 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 413, 1, 2, 757748) Most certainly there is anger in me.
('73', 413, 1, 3, 757785) The silence eats it all up.
('73', 413, 1, 4, 757813) After all, how much anger can I give vent to by writing ?
('73', 413, 2, 5, 757871) We are going through a period of wet adversity.
('73', 413, 2, 6, 757919) Water is dripp ing everywhere.
('73', 413, 2, 7, 757950) You will see evidence of it in this also.
('73', 413, 2, 8, 757992) I fully realize now the meaning of living in a village.
('73', 413, 3, 9, 758048) I am enclosing Ramdass letter.
('73', 413, 4, 10, 758079) Ramachandran is likely to be arrested in a day or two.
('73', 413, 4, 11, 758134) Rajkumari will return from Travancore tomorrow.
('73', 413, 4, 12, 758182) Poor woman, she did her very best.
('73', 413, 4, 13, 758217) But after all we can only try, is not that so ?
('73', 413, 4, 14, 758265) We have left, and should leave, credit or discredit to God.
('73', 413, 4, 15, 758325) If we do not act thus, we would come to grief.

('73', 413, 12, 25, 758793) You yourself should write to Bhulabhai.

('73', 415, 3, 6, 760246) Gandhiji was of course silent, but he received them and asked them in writing if they would be content with written replies.
('73', 415, 3, 7, 760371) They said they would.
('73', 415, 3, 8, 760393) He asked them to explain the purpose of their visit.
('73', 415, 4, 9, 760446) We gave you notice, their spokesman said, that unless you could have a Harijan appointed as a Cabinet Minister we should go to Segaon and do satyagraha there.
('73', 415, 4, 10, 760605) You asked us to desist.
('73', 415, 4, 11, 760629) We did so and wrote to you to say so.
('73', 415, 4, 12, 760667) But after that, having heard nothing from you we decided to fulfil our promise.
('73', 415, 5, 13, 760747) GANDHIJI: But what do you want, and what do you mean by satyagraha?
('73', 415, 6, 14, 760815) HARIJANS: We want a Harijan to be in the Cabinet and a seat reserved in the Cabinet for a Harijan as there is one reserved for a Mussalman.
('73', 415, 7, 15, 760955) G. But that is not in my power.
('73', 415, 8, 16, 760987) H. It is.
('73', 415, 8, 17, 760997) You were prepared to lay down your life for the Harijans at Yeravda and your fast led to the Yeravda Pact.
('73', 415, 8, 18, 761104) You can do everything for the Harijans.
('73', 415, 9, 19, 761144) G. I am doing all that is in my power.
('73', 415, 9, 20, 761183) But let that be.
('73', 415, 9, 21, 761200) What do you mean by satyagraha?
('73', 415, 10, 22, 761232) H. We will remain here without food until another party from Nagpur comes to relieve us.
('73', 415, 11, 23, 761321) G. You are welcome to do so.
('73', 415, 11, 24, 761350) You want me to provide you with room.
('73', 415, 11, 25, 761388) Well we are cramped for space, but you tell us where you will sit, and we will vacate the place for you.
('73', 415, 12, 26, 761493) H. We will be fasting, and five or six people will have to stay with us to attend to our needs whilst we are fasting.
('73', 415, 13, 27, 761611) G. I am not concerned with that.
('73', 415, 13, 28, 761644) You select the place and we vacate it for you.
('73', 415, 13, 29, 761691) One of the Ashram inmates went out with them to show them over the place.
('73', 415, 13, 30, 761765) He returned to say that they wanted a room adjoining a hut reserved for women and also the verandah in front of it.

('73', 425, 12, 24, 774938) DEAR RAJENDRA BABU,
('73', 425, 13, 25, 774958) It seems to me that we do not read in the right spirit what our opponents write.
('73', 425, 13, 26, 775039) The point is not that the language is abusive.
('73', 425, 13, 27, 775086) The socialists are carrying on massive activities for an ideal.
('73', 425, 13, 28, 775150) We should not ignore them.
('73', 425, 13, 29, 775177) There is some criticism of the Bihar Bill in the current Congress Socialist.
('73', 425, 13, 30, 775254) There are other articles too.
('73', 425, 13, 31, 775284) Read them.
('73', 425, 13, 32, 775295) Write an article about the Bihar Bill in reply to the article in the Congress Socialist.

('73', 426, 1, 3, 775551) Glance through them.
('73', 426, 1, 4, 775572) Somebody at least should read such things.
('73', 426, 1, 5, 775615) We should not be unaware of all these ideas.
('73', 426, 1, 6, 775660) Leaflets should be distributed among the peasants on behalf of the Congress governments.
('73', 426, 1, 7, 775749) This suggestion should be implemented at once.

('73', 426, 13, 22, 776238) Are the mosambis over?
('73', 426, 13, 23, 776261) Ba says that there are still many mosambis left.
('73', 426, 13, 24, 776310) Find out correctly and tell me.
('73', 426, 13, 25, 776342) How many are there?
('73', 426, 13, 26, 776362) They are more than enough.
('73', 426, 13, 27, 776389) Pyarelal would need very few or none at all.
('73', 426, 13, 28, 776434) Who all are taking mosambis?
('73', 426, 13, 29, 776463) Chimanlal, etc.?
('73', 426, 13, 30, 776480) The point is that it should not be made a duty for Rajaram to go.
('73', 426, 13, 31, 776546) If it can be managed, he should not be sent in such rains.
('73', 426, 13, 32, 776605) I have been facing such problems from the days of South Africa.
('73', 426, 13, 33, 776669) There too a particular man went to the city every day.
('73', 426, 13, 34, 776724) I came to know about it.
('73', 426, 13, 35, 776749) I took up cudgels and resolved that he should go only twice a week.
('73', 426, 13, 36, 776817) Thereby, I saved energy, time and money.

('73', 429, 3, 8, 780109) So much for jest.
('73', 429, 3, 9, 780127) I certainly like it that Sita is coming over but will it not affect her studies?
('73', 429, 3, 10, 780208) From my point of view, children do learn here but what they learn is of a different kind altogether.
('73', 429, 3, 11, 780309) The two cannot be combined.

('73', 429, 9, 21, 780762) PYARELAL, Munnalals letter was not meant to be read by you.
('73', 429, 9, 22, 780822) You are still considered an invalid.
('73', 429, 9, 23, 780859) Besides, you should not be upset by what Munnalal says, but should accept anything that may be good in it.
('73', 429, 9, 24, 780966) In any case, the letter is not for Mother 1. I would consider it sinful even to tell her anything.
('73', 429, 9, 25, 781065) With you and Sushila around, I am not worried about Mother.
('73', 429, 9, 26, 781125) I take it that there will be no hesitation in asking for whatever may be needed by her.
('73', 429, 9, 27, 781213) I must know when she does not get what she asks for.
('73', 429, 9, 28, 781266) The origin of Munnalals letter lies in the conver sation between Sushila and me.
('73', 429, 9, 29, 781347) I had asked Sushila to keep an eye on things.
('73', 429, 9, 30, 781393) She brought to my notice instances of uncleanliness.
('73', 429, 9, 31, 781446) I made inquiries and then there was a certain improvement.
('73', 429, 9, 32, 781505) The matter went further and it was desired that rather than make comments in front of

('73', 430, 12, 18, 782369) The Sardar is not going to foment trouble.
('73', 430, 12, 19, 782412) He has been President of the Rajakiya Parishad.
('73', 430, 12, 20, 782460) He has been honoured as a guest in several States.
('73', 430, 12, 21, 782511) He owes a duty to his co workers of the Parishad.
('73', 430, 12, 22, 782561) He goes merely as a guide.
('73', 430, 12, 23, 782588) It is strange that you should regard his coming as outside interference.
('73', 430, 12, 24, 782661) I expect you to take advantage of his presence to produce harmony if the agitation is confined to a mino rity.
('73', 430, 12, 25, 782772) You may depend upon the Sardar.
('73', 430, 12, 26, 782804) Knowing as I do so many of the workers, I am unable to regard them as ill meaning agitators.
('73', 430, 12, 27, 782897) Please share this with Bhayats, Lohana Samaj and the Muslim Council, who have wired to me.

('73', 431, 2, 3, 783418) September 3, 1938 I have been in close touch with the prime movers affected by the tragedy which is now being enacted in Travancore, and I had hoped that I should be able to avoid having to make any public statement.
('73', 431, 2, 4, 783635) After a study of the available evidence and interviews with rep resentative men from Travancore, I have come to the conclusion that the Travancore Government are resorting to repressive methods, far in excess of the requirements, if there are any.
('73', 431, 2, 5, 783883) The Travancore Government contend that the Travancore State Congress activities are disloyal and subversive.
('73', 431, 2, 6, 783992) I have studied the documents alleged to contain evidence in support of such a charge and have failed to find anything of that nature.
('73', 431, 2, 7, 784126) On the contrary, I have seen emphatic repudiaton by the State Congress of the charge unless constitutional agitation for responsible government is to be called subversive.
('73', 431, 2, 8, 784298) I have, however, read the memorial of the Working Committee of the Travancore State Congress, making the most serious charges unsupported by any evidence against the able Dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar.
('73', 431, 2, 9, 784503) They should never have been made, even if the memorialists had evidence in support.
('73', 431, 2, 10, 784587) Such evidence is irrelevant to the case for responsible government.
('73', 431, 2, 11, 784655) It would have its place in a memorial for the removal of the Dewan.
('73', 431, 2, 12, 784723) There is no doubt that these charges have harmed the memorialists and therefore the State Con gress, though they cannot weaken the case for responsible govern ment.
('73', 431, 2, 13, 784888) I have no doubt whatsoever that the case for responsible government will be strengthened by the frightfulness being committed by the Government of Travancore if only the people will not be demoralized and will continue to adhere to non violence.
('73', 431, 2, 14, 785134) If reports about violence by students are true, I appeal to the students to desist and allow the movement to develop non violently.
('73', 431, 2, 15, 785266) Leaders who have been locked up should make amends by with drawing the charges against the Dewan.
('73', 431, 2, 16, 785364) I had the honour of meeting the young Maharaja and the Maharani.
('73', 431, 2, 17, 785429) I have had the privilege of knowing Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar for many years.
('73', 431, 2, 18, 785507) I appeal to them to retrace their steps and allow
('73', 432, 0, 1, 785557) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 433
('73', 432, 1, 2, 785607) the State Congress to function so long as its activities remain peaceful.
('73', 432, 1, 3, 785681) Surely the common law of the State is enough to cope with individuals using violent language or resorting to actual violence.
('73', 432, 1, 4, 785807) But at this hour of the day, to expect the people to submit to the suppression of free speech or of demands, however advanced these may be is to invite trouble.
('73', 432, 1, 5, 785968) In my humble opinion, the prevention of Shrimati Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya from entering the State was a first class tactical blunder.
('73', 432, 1, 6, 786103) it passes comprehension how Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, himself a foreigner, prohibited the entry of a distinguished Indian lady on the grounds, according to him, of her being an outsider.
('73', 432, 1, 7, 786291) She was amenable to the State law if she had committed any breach thereof.
('73', 432, 1, 8, 786366) I thought it was only reserved for the English administrators to treat Indians going from one province to another as foreigners.
('73', 432, 1, 9, 786495) It ill becomes the Indian Princes and their advisers to follow the perni cious practice of the English administratorsa practice of which many Englishmen are heartily ashamed.
('73', 432, 1, 10, 786670) The Government may, by the terrible repression they have resorted to, succeed in killing the move ment for the time being, but it will never die and will leave a bitter memory behind.
('73', 432, 1, 11, 786854) I hope that wiser counsels will yet prevail and the State Congress will be permitted to function properly.

('73', 432, 3, 13, 786980) 596. CHOICE BEFORE CONGRESSMEN
('73', 432, 4, 14, 787011) Since the publication of my article 1 on violence said to be creeping into the Congress ranks, evidence is coming in to corro borate the complaints made by my correspondents.
('73', 432, 4, 15, 787186) Violence at Con gress elections, they say, is on the increase.
('73', 432, 4, 16, 787249) It looks as if Congressmen are not able to digest the power that has come to the Congress.
('73', 432, 4, 17, 787340) Everyone wants to have a share in the spoils of office.
('73', 432, 4, 18, 787396) And so there is an unhealthy competition to capture committees.
('73', 432, 4, 19, 787460) This is not the way to win swaraj, nor is it the way to work the office programme.
('73', 432, 4, 20, 787543) The holding of any office in the Congress Government must be in the spirit of service without the slightest expectation of personal gain.
('73', 432, 4, 21, 787681) If A is satisfied in ordinary life with getting Rs. 25 per month, he has no right to expect Rs. 250 on becoming a minister or obtaining any other office under the Govern

('73', 433, 0, 1, 787882) 434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 433, 1, 2, 787924) And there are many Congressmen who are taking only Rs. 25 per month in voluntary organizations and who are well able to shoulder ministerial responsibility.
('73', 433, 1, 3, 788081) Bengal and Maharashtra are teem ing with able men who have dedicated themselves to public service on a mere pittance and who are well able to give a good account of themselves no matter where they are put.
('73', 433, 1, 4, 788287) But they are not to be tempted to leave the fields they have chosen, and it would be wrong to drag them out of their invaluable self chosen obscurity.
('73', 433, 1, 5, 788438) It is true all the world over, and more true perhaps of this country, that as a rule the best and the wisest men will not become ministers or accept positions under Governments.
('73', 433, 1, 6, 788616) But I have digressed.
('73', 433, 1, 7, 788638) We may not always get the best and the wisest men and women to run Congress Governments, but swaraj will become a distant dream if the ministers and other Congressmen holding offices are not self less, able and incorruptible.
('73', 433, 1, 8, 788864) We are not likely to have such men if congress committees become job hunting arenas in which the most violent would win.
('73', 433, 1, 9, 788985) How to preserve the purity of the organization is the question.
('73', 433, 1, 10, 789049) Anyone who subscribes to the credal article of the Congress and pays 4 annas can demand registration as a member.
('73', 433, 1, 11, 789163) Many sign the congress pledge without believing in the necessity for observing truth and non violence as conditions of attainment of swaraj.
('73', 433, 1, 12, 789304) Let no one cavil at my use of the expressions truthful and non violent as synonymous with legitimate and peaceful.
('73', 433, 1, 13, 789419) From the very comm encement of the Congress constitution I have used those adjectives without challenge.
('73', 433, 1, 14, 789524) The word non violence was first introduced by me in the resolution on non co operation carried in Calcutta by the Congress.
('73', 433, 1, 15, 789648) Can anything be untruthful and yet be legitimate, violent and yet be peaceful?
('73', 433, 1, 16, 789727) Be that as it may, I claim that those who commit a breach of these two primary conditions, no matter by what adjectives they are known, can have no place in the Congress organization so long as it is governed by the present constitution.
('73', 433, 1, 17, 789965) Similarly those who do not use khadi as habitual wear have no place in any Congress committee.
('73', 433, 1, 18, 790060) This condition should apply also to those who do not carry out vital resolutions of the Congress, A.I.C.C. or the Working Committee.
('73', 433, 1, 19, 790193) My prescription would be that those who commit a breach of any of these conditions should automatically cease to belong to the Congress.
('73', 433, 1, 20, 790330) It may be urged that the remedy is too drastic.
('73', 433, 1, 21, 790378) It is, if it is regarded as a punishment.
('73', 433, 1, 22, 790420) If it is the automatic
('73', 434, 0, 1, 790443) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 435
('73', 434, 1, 2, 790493) result of a particular act or omission of a person, it is no punishment.
('73', 434, 1, 3, 790566) I know that thrusting my finger into a furnace will surely burn it and still I thrust it; my suffering is no punishment, it is the natural consequence of my action.
('73', 434, 1, 4, 790731) Punishment depends upon the will of the judge.
('73', 434, 1, 5, 790778) Natural consequences are independent of any persons will.
('73', 434, 1, 6, 790836) It will be urged that under these conditions the Congress will cease to be a democratic organization, it will become a close corpo ration.
('73', 434, 1, 7, 790975) I hold a wholly contrary view.
('73', 434, 1, 8, 791006) Democracy of the West is, in my opinion, only so called.
('73', 434, 1, 9, 791063) It has germs in it, certainly, of the true type.
('73', 434, 1, 10, 791112) But it can only come when all violence is eschewed and malpractices disappear.
('73', 434, 1, 11, 791191) The two go hand in hand.
('73', 434, 1, 12, 791216) Indeed malpractice is a species of violence.
('73', 434, 1, 13, 791261) If India is to evolve the true type, there would be no compromise with violence or untruth.
('73', 434, 1, 14, 791353) Ten million men and women on the Congress register with violence and untruth in their breasts would not evolve real democracy or bring swaraj.
('73', 434, 1, 15, 791496) But I can conceive the possibility of ten thousand Con gressmen and women who are cent per cent true, and free from having to carry the burden of innumerable doubtful companions, bringing swaraj.
('73', 434, 1, 16, 791692) Let us reflect upon the past a little.
('73', 434, 1, 17, 791731) Over fifty years ago a handful of men and women took it into their heads to meet together and represent and speak in the name of the dumb millions.
('73', 434, 1, 18, 791879) Time has proved the validity of their claim.
('73', 434, 1, 19, 791924) Since then the prestige of the Congress has risen not in proportion to its numbers, not in proportion to the display of intellect on the platform or in committee rooms, but it has risen in proportion to the ability of Congressmen to suffer and sacrifice, themselves for the nation.
('73', 434, 1, 20, 792206) No one will deny that when in 1920 the Congress definitely became a democratic, duly elected body having a large number of voters on its rolls, it found itself possessed of new power only because it deliberately adopted truth and non violence as its means of reaching its goal.
('73', 434, 1, 21, 792484) And even at the present day, the Congress has quite an insignificant number of men and women on its register compared to the tremendous power it wields.
('73', 434, 1, 22, 792637) The reason to my mind is that it shows a measure of sacrifice cohesion and discipline unequalled by any other organization in India.
('73', 434, 1, 23, 792770) But as an experienced servant and general I make bold to say that we shall have to show a much higher measure of these qualities if we are to win independence before many years are out.
('73', 434, 1, 24, 792956) It is my deliberate convic tion based on closest observation that we can secure all we want, within
('73', 435, 0, 1, 793056) 436 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 435, 1, 2, 793098) much less time than perhaps any one of us imagines, simply by showing high efficiency and equally high honesty in every one of the Congress activities.
('73', 435, 1, 3, 793250) It would ill become us as truly brave men and women to wish ill to the British in order to gain our end.
('73', 435, 1, 4, 793355) In non violent warfare wishing ill to the enemy is not permissible A non violent person relies upon his own strength and refuses to trade upon his opponents weakness.
('73', 435, 1, 5, 793522) With all the earnestness I can command I, therefore, plead with every Congressman who believes in his pledge to make his choice: either to apply the purge I have suggested, or, if that is not feasible because of the Congress being already overmanned by those who have lost faith in its creed and its constructive programme on which depends its real strength, to secede from it for its own sake and prove his living faith in the creed and programme by practising the former and prosecuting the latter as if he had never seceded from the Congress of his ideal.
('73', 435, 1, 6, 794081) If one or the other thing is not done, I see grave danger of the Congress collapsing by the weight of its own weaknesses.
('73', 435, 1, 7, 794203) It has given me no pleasure to pen these lines.
('73', 435, 1, 8, 794251) But having felt the urge, I would have been untrue to the Congress if I had not uttered the warning.
('73', 435, 1, 9, 794352) It is the voice of silence.
('73', 435, 1, 10, 794380) For the reader should know I took silence over a fortnight ago for an indefinite period.
('73', 435, 1, 11, 794469) It has given me peace I cannot describe, and it enables me to commune with Nature.

('73', 436, 11, 27, 796215) Sushila does not seem to like the idea.
('73', 436, 11, 28, 796255) Whether she will have complete peace of course rests in your hands and mine.
('73', 436, 11, 29, 796332) But whatever peace she can have depends only on her staying with both of us.

('73', 437, 6, 14, 797252) It is a great transformation.

('73', 438, 3, 4, 798052) KRISHNACHANDRA, About the first letter, I can only say that I never suspected the palate 1. About the other, I can say that I allow the massage if I need it, otherwise I stop it in a few minutes.
('73', 438, 3, 5, 798248) Why should I let Amtussalaam come when I do not need her services?
('73', 438, 3, 6, 798315) I did not know that she woke you up every night.
('73', 438, 3, 7, 798364) But you will have to sleep near me when Amtussalaam leaves me and when Lilavati will not be there.
('73', 438, 3, 8, 798463) Then you will see how I box your ears.

('73', 438, 8, 14, 798642) [September 5, 1938] 1
('73', 438, 9, 15, 798664) I have read Dr. Khares own defence.
('73', 438, 9, 16, 798700) The only part that directly concerns me I owe it to the public to answer.
('73', 438, 9, 17, 798774) It is painful for me to have to contradict Dr. Khare.
('73', 438, 9, 18, 798828) He came to Segaon voluntarily.
('73', 438, 9, 19, 798859) He came as a friend.
('73', 438, 9, 20, 798880) There was no protest on his part when he came.
('73', 438, 9, 21, 798927) It was not without full argument that he felt convinced of the charges I brought against him.
('73', 438, 9, 22, 799021) When he realized the force of my argument, he said he placed himself unreservedly in my hands.
('73', 438, 9, 23, 799116) I told him that as he had admittedly lost his balance, if he felt like consulting his friends whom I had named, he should do so.
('73', 438, 9, 24, 799245) There was no desperate hurry.
('73', 438, 9, 25, 799275) He said he was quite capable of deciding for himself and that there was no need to consult other friends.
('73', 438, 9, 26, 799381) Then I said he should better write out himself what he had admitted.
('73', 438, 9, 27, 799450) He suggested that I should draft a statement, as he was no draftsman.
('73', 438, 9, 28, 799520) I said nevertheless that I wanted his language.
('73', 438, 9, 29, 799568) If I felt it did not cover sufficiently what he had admitted, I would revise it or
('73', 438, 10, 30, 799651) 1 The Gujarati original has swada, which means relish of the palate.

('73', 439, 1, 2, 799789) add to it.
('73', 439, 1, 3, 799800) After some hesitation he took pen and paper and drew up the draft.
('73', 439, 1, 4, 799867) I then took it up and made the corrections and additions.
('73', 439, 1, 5, 799925) 1 He read them twice or thrice and said he could never admit betrayal of trust and that in any case he would not make any statement there and then but would accept my suggestion that he should consult his friends.
('73', 439, 1, 6, 800139) Three oclock the following day was the time limit fixed for the receipt of his answer.
('73', 439, 1, 7, 800226) I have consulted the President, Maulana Saheb and Sardar Patel, who are here, and they confirm my version.

('73', 439, 5, 19, 800717) It is brave of you to write directly to me.
('73', 439, 5, 20, 800761) I have torn up the letter after reading it.
('73', 439, 5, 21, 800805) It is a strange story !
('73', 439, 5, 22, 800829) I will write when you come.
('73', 439, 5, 23, 800857) There is nothing to worry about.
('73', 439, 5, 24, 800890) The thing is so ridiculous.

('73', 441, 9, 21, 803651) I fear I cannot take shelter under ignorance of the Press messages published from time to time on the tragedy that is being continued in Travancore.
('73', 441, 9, 22, 803800) 2 Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyars defence reads like an edition of the reports that used to be issued on behalf of the British Government during the civil disobedience campaign.
('73', 441, 9, 23, 803973) Not even the massacre of Jallianwalla was justified exactly as the Travancore shootings are now being justified.
('73', 441, 9, 24, 804086) Was not General Dyers action subsequently condemned?

('73', 444, 5, 15, 808186) But please know that the treatment there is mere quackery.

('73', 444, 5, 18, 808301) Go to Manjubehn.
('73', 444, 5, 19, 808318) Let her examine you and suggest whatever remedy she likes.
('73', 444, 5, 20, 808377) It would be better if you did not go to Maroli just now.
('73', 444, 5, 21, 808434) I will not have your illness being prolonged there.
('73', 444, 5, 22, 808486) I would bear it even if you were to die here because I would be sure then that scientific treatment had been given.

('73', 445, 3, 12, 809614) Instead of judging the world, we should judge ourselves and do what we can.
('73', 445, 3, 13, 809690) Bearing in mind that He who controls us all is perfect, we should be content with whatever we are able to do.
('73', 445, 3, 14, 809800) Have faith that in the measure in which you are able to improve your village, other villages also will improve, and concentrate on that task.

('73', 445, 8, 25, 810293) She need not act under pressure from Mother.
('73', 445, 8, 26, 810338) But if she is moved by Mothers love, she should not grum ble.

('73', 445, 8, 30, 810540) I see that our ideas of duty differ.

('73', 451, 3, 11, 817637) Because I have spoken and written at length on this subject.

('73', 453, 4, 5, 819011) NEW DELHI, March 3, 1938
('73', 453, 5, 6, 819036) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('73', 453, 6, 7, 819053) I have received your letter of the 24th February, 1938. I am sorry for the delay in replying as I was not well.
('73', 453, 6, 8, 819165) In your letter I missed the note of response, first whether you are of opinion that you see light now and the moment has come, and secondly, if so, whether you are prepared to take the matter up in right earnest, and thirdly, I find that there is no change in your attitude and mentality when you say you would be guided by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad as Dr. Ansari is no more.
('73', 453, 6, 9, 819539) If you pursue this line you will be repeating the same tragedy as you did when you expressed your helplessness because Dr. Ansari, holding pronounced and die hard views, did not agree and you had to say that although you were willing, but what could you do?
('73', 453, 6, 10, 819797) This happened, as you know, before you went to the Round Table Conference.
('73', 453, 6, 11, 819872) At the Round Table Conference the tragedy was repeated by you when you seemed to be willing to accept provisionally certain terms: but you there also expressed that you were helpless as the Hindus were unwilling and you, as a representative of the Congress, would have no objection, if the Hindus and Mussalmans came to an agreement.
('73', 453, 7, 12, 820206) We have reached a stage when no doubt should be left that you recognize the All India Muslim League as the one authoritative and representative organization of the Mussalmans of India and on the other hand you represent the Congress and other Hindus throughout the country.
('73', 453, 7, 13, 820480) It is only on that basis that we can proceed further and devise machinery of approach.
('73', 453, 8, 14, 820567) Of course, I shall be glad to see you, although I shall be equally glad to see Pandit Jawaharlal or Mr. Bose, [as] you may desire.
('73', 453, 8, 15, 820698) The matter as you know will not be clinched without reference again to you by either of them.
('73', 453, 8, 16, 820792) Therefore, I will prefer to see you first.
('73', 453, 8, 17, 820835) In any case, I am sorry to say that I cannot come to Segaon to see you before the 10th March.
('73', 453, 8, 18, 820929) I have to go to Bombay and also I have fixed various other engagements of my tour.
('73', 453, 8, 19, 821012) But we can fix up the time and place that may suit us both.
('73', 453, 8, 20, 821072) Yours sincerely,

('73', 454, 1, 2, 821225) APPENDIX II
('73', 454, 2, 3, 821237) A TRAGEDY 1
('73', 454, 3, 4, 821249) I proudly write in these columns about Gandhijis health, discussing the causes of its breakdown, warning people, asking them to give him more rest.
('73', 454, 3, 5, 821397) Ruthlessly I have turned out people wanting to see him, and have even interrupted talks and interviews, lest they should strain him over much and raise his blood pressure.
('73', 454, 3, 6, 821569) Fancy, therefore, my misery and my shame when I found one morning at Delang that what he considered a serious blunder on my part had raised his blood pressure to the breaking point and might have brought about a catastrophe.
('73', 454, 3, 7, 821794) Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, 29th, 30th and 31stwhich in that peaceful atmosphere of Orissa should have been the most blissful dayswere the most miserable days I have ever had in my life.
('73', 454, 3, 8, 821989) But they were, if anything, more miserable for Gandhiji, as I found from his heart broken and heart breaking utterance on the afternoon of the 30th.
('73', 454, 3, 9, 822138) I thought I had made amends indeed at that mornings prayer by telling everyone present how I had been the cause of the terrible breakdown, but Gandhiji was not present when I spoke.
('73', 454, 3, 10, 822320) But he knew that I had spoken about the incident, and so he devoted his speech to the incident.
('73', 454, 3, 11, 822416) I bespeak the indulgence of the reader for inflicting on him this tale of personal woe.
('73', 454, 3, 12, 822504) But I do it on public grounds, as he will find at the end of the story.
('73', 454, 4, 13, 822576) The circumstances were somewhat like these.
('73', 454, 4, 14, 822620) My wife, who rarely attends the annual meetings of the Gandhi Seva Sangh, or for that matter any such meetings, came to Delang, especially, I was told, with a view to being able to go to Puri.
('73', 454, 4, 15, 822813) And Gandhiji told me that I should make every arrangement for her going to Puri.
('73', 454, 4, 16, 822894) Personally I disliked her having come for the sake of Puri, and had no heart to make any arrangements.
('73', 454, 4, 17, 822997) I was once again asked if I had made the arrangements, and asked a third time.
('73', 454, 4, 18, 823076) My wife to my surprise did not know that the Puri temple was not open to the Harijans.
('73', 454, 4, 19, 823163) During Gandhijis Harijan tour she was in jail.
('73', 454, 4, 20, 823210) But that was no excuse for the ignorance.
('73', 454, 4, 21, 823252) On the very first day in the course of his exhibition speech Gandhiji made it clear that the temple of the Lord of the World was not open to the Harijans, and so long as it remained so, the Lord was not, in his opinion, the Lord of the World, but the Lord of those who fed and feasted under His shelter.
('73', 454, 4, 22, 823556) I had hoped that this speech would be a warning to all, including my wife, though I had a fear that she would go into the temple.
('73', 454, 4, 23, 823686) I must also confess that I had a lurking suspicion thatGandhijis repeated insistence on my making arrangements for her going to Puri sprang out of the depth of his ahimsathe ahimsa that had made him serve liquor to Tommies in the Zulu Rebellion, and to serve meat to his friends at table in South Africa.
('73', 454, 4, 24, 823991) I had also hoped that because she was going there with a number of other friends, including Gandhijis second son Manilal, she would not go into the temple when the rest stood out.
('73', 454, 4, 25, 824171) What I did not do was to din into her head that her going into
('73', 454, 5, 26, 824234) 1 Vide Letter to Mirabehn,4 4 1938
('73', 455, 0, 1, 824269) 456 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('73', 455, 1, 2, 824311) the temple would break Gandhijis heart.
('73', 455, 1, 3, 824351) As I have said, I was stupid enough not to realize the possible reaction and had even fancied that in the boundless charity of his heart he had found room for forgiving a temple goer like my wife.
('73', 455, 1, 4, 824548) I must therefore confess that even if she had definitely told me before going that she had made up her mind to go into the temple, I should not have resisted her.
('73', 455, 1, 5, 824711) I did not want to disturb her faith to that extent.
('73', 455, 1, 6, 824763) She knew that I was against it, she also knew that I have a horror of these templestemples which even when they are opened to the Harijans, would not be better unless they were purged of the unscrupulous pandas.
('73', 455, 1, 7, 824975) But if she thought it would do her soul good to go into the temple, I did not in my heart of hearts feel like standing in the way.
('73', 455, 1, 8, 825106) As for Kasturba Gandhi, I must say that I had assumed she would stand out and her presence would perhaps act as a check on my wife and others.
('73', 455, 1, 9, 825249) But as it happened, my wife went in, another friend went in, and also went in Kasturba.
('73', 455, 1, 10, 825337) Some members of the party stayed out, including my little son who put up a plucky fight with the pandas.
('73', 455, 2, 11, 825442) On Monday evening when they returned and Gandhiji knew the whole story, he was sad.
('73', 455, 2, 12, 825526) He had a sleepless night.
('73', 455, 2, 13, 825552) He called Kasturba and my wife and me to account.
('73', 455, 2, 14, 825602) The explanation, part of which is contained in the argument above, failed to satisfy him.
('73', 455, 2, 15, 825692) It even irritated him.
('73', 455, 2, 16, 825715) He held that I was primarily to blame.
('73', 455, 2, 17, 825754) He held that I should have explained to them the history of the movement, how Gandhiji had gone to Puri in 1934, how violence was organized there, how he had to undertake the Orissa pilgrimage on foot, how reformers were warned not to go to the temple until Harijans were admitted, and if my wife still did not listen, Gandhijis assistance should have been sought, and if then too she insisted on going she should have been free to go.
('73', 455, 2, 18, 826190) He held hat I had not been watchful enough and that I had thus been unjust to him, my wife, myself and to the cause.
('73', 455, 2, 19, 826307) And so he thus poured out his heart to the members of the Sangh : 1
('73', 455, 3, 20, 826375) This pouring out of the agony of his heart was for me an added agony.
('73', 455, 3, 21, 826445) He was so disconsolate.
('73', 455, 3, 22, 826469) The next day he felt too weak to speak and went into silence for the whole day as a measure of precaution.
('73', 455, 3, 23, 826576) What could I do in the circumstances?
('73', 455, 3, 24, 826614) I was afraid lest I should make matters worse by entering into explanations and arguments.
('73', 455, 3, 25, 826705) I felt like waiting until he had regained his normal pressure and strength.
('73', 455, 3, 26, 826781) But the thought of my having been the cause of the collapse tormented me.
('73', 455, 3, 27, 826855) If I was guilty of a grievous error of judgment, how could I continue to serve him?
('73', 455, 3, 28, 826939) How could I correctly represent and serve the Harijan cause?
('73', 455, 3, 29, 827000) What right had I to be his door keeper?
('73', 455, 3, 30, 827040) I had the hell of a night, and in sheer desperation I wrote to him a note imploring him to put me away.
('73', 455, 3, 31, 827144) This exasperated him all the more and made the cross heavier to bear.
('73', 455, 3, 32, 827214) He would prefer death, he said, at the hands of one who loved, to life at the hands of one who did not love him !
('73', 455, 3, 33, 827328) Instead of realizing my folly and repairing it by going to Puri with a band of satyagrahi pilgrims, he said, I had gone into hysterics over a well meant rebuke !
('73', 455, 3, 34, 827490) Instead of serving my wife, he said, I had in my blind love of her

('73', 456, 0, 1, 827644) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 457
('73', 456, 1, 2, 827694) encouraged her superstition !
('73', 456, 2, 3, 827724) All this was too stunning for words.
('73', 456, 2, 4, 827761) I felt that Gandhiji, who has performed
('73', 456, 3, 5, 827801) several spiritual operations using the chloroform of love, had performed this one
('73', 456, 4, 6, 827883) without that chloroform.
('73', 456, 4, 7, 827908) In resentment I cried :
('73', 456, 5, 8, 827932) To live with the saints in heaven
('73', 456, 6, 9, 827966) Is a bliss and a glory,
('73', 456, 7, 10, 827990) But to live with a saint on earth
('73', 456, 8, 11, 828024) Is a different story.
('73', 456, 9, 12, 828046) May it not be that he had made a mountain of a molehill ?
('73', 456, 10, 13, 828104) But who am I to judge?
('73', 456, 10, 14, 828127) As I write this I feel that I was perhaps too dense to
('73', 456, 11, 15, 828182) probe into the workings of his highy sensitive mind.
('73', 456, 11, 16, 828235) And after all he who had
('73', 456, 12, 17, 828260) devoted half a century of vigilant endeavour to the pursuit of truth and ahimsa should
('73', 456, 13, 18, 828347) be trusted to judge a situation better than I, ever liable to be swayed by passions and
('73', 456, 14, 19, 828435) desires.
('73', 456, 14, 20, 828444) What may appear to me to be trifles may be matters of life and death to him.
('73', 456, 15, 21, 828521) realized that however difficult life with him may appear sometimes, separation would
('73', 456, 16, 22, 828606) be still more unbearable.
('73', 456, 16, 23, 828632) He disclaims saintship.
('73', 456, 16, 24, 828656) He claims to be no better than the
('73', 456, 17, 25, 828691) smallest of us.
('73', 456, 17, 26, 828707) I realized that I had grievously erred in associating even in thought
('73', 456, 18, 27, 828777) those doleful lines with him.
('73', 456, 18, 28, 828807) Whether he is a saint or a mere mortal, like all of us, I
('73', 456, 19, 29, 828865) see that my cry for separation was a fit of frenzy.
('73', 456, 19, 30, 828917) For when I look upon the note that I
('73', 456, 20, 31, 828954) wrote to him, I feel I could not have gone five yards before returning as a penitent.
('73', 456, 21, 32, 829040) And after all is said and done, one thing stands out in bold reliefGandhijis
('73', 456, 22, 33, 829117) uncompromising love of the Harijans and his anxiety to lay down his life for that
('73', 456, 23, 34, 829199) The poignant utterance became a call to greater dedication for the cause.
('73', 456, 24, 35, 829273) incident burnt into every one of those who attended the Sangh meeting this year the
('73', 456, 25, 36, 829357) lesson that no one shall tamper with that most important item of the constructive
('73', 456, 26, 37, 829439) programme and that everyone shall be wide awake.
('73', 456, 26, 38, 829488) The week of retreat in sacred
('73', 456, 27, 39, 829518) Orissa became more sacred with the cleansing effect of the electric shock that
('73', 456, 28, 40, 829597) Gandhiji gave them, and the members went home with a message that they are not
('73', 456, 29, 41, 829676) likely easily to forget.

('73', 457, 2, 3, 829812) May 11, 1938
('73', 457, 3, 4, 829825) DEAR MR. GANDHI,
('73', 457, 4, 5, 829842) I write to acquaint you with the conclusions which have been reached by the Government of Bengal in the matter of the premature release of terrorist convicts.
('73', 457, 4, 6, 830001) In formulating these proposals, Government have given the most careful consideration to the suggestions which you were good enough to put forward in your letter of April 12.
('73', 457, 5, 7, 830175) It is necessary to emphasize at the outset that the scheme which is embodied in the succeeding paragraph is to be regarded as a connected plan, the different parts of which form a single and indivisible whole.
('73', 457, 5, 8, 830385) As such, it is communicated not only for securing your own acceptance, but also the acceptance of Mr. Sarat Chandra Bose, President of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee as well as the leader of the Congress party in the Assembly.
('73', 457, 6, 9, 830622) Government desire to commend the scheme to your most earnest conside ration, because the declared acceptance by you, and by the Congress of Governments policy in this matter is a vital precedent condition to the adoption of the plan.
('73', 457, 6, 10, 830856) In the absence of that acceptance Government will regard these proposals as null and void and will continue to discharge their responsibilities in this matter, according to the policy which has already been announced in the Legislature.
('73', 457, 7, 11, 831093) The scheme is as follows :
('73', 457, 8, 12, 831120) (1) To release forthwith terrorist convicts suffering from serious and con tinued illness.
('73', 457, 9, 13, 831211) (2) To release as soon as possible those convicts who have not been con victed of offences involving the actual commission of murder and serious violence, and have a comparatively short period of their sentences not in excess of 18 months still to serve.
('73', 457, 10, 14, 831466) (3) To place the cases of the remaining convicts before an Advisory Committee which will examine them on individual merits and make such recommen dations in each case to Government as it thinks fit.
('73', 457, 11, 15, 831665) The decision as to the orders to be passed in each case, after consideration of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, will rest with Government.
('73', 457, 11, 16, 831818) (4) The Advisory Committee will be appointed by Government and will consist of 9 members as follows : (i) The President, a retired judicial officer of high standing; (ii) A member of the Coalition Party;

('73', 458, 1, 2, 832118) (iii) A member of the Legislative Assembly from the Congress Party; (iv) A member of the Legislative Assembly from amongst the representatives of the Scheduled Castes; (v) A member of the Legislative Assembly from the Liberal Party; (vi) A member of the Legislative Council from the Congress Party; (vii) A European member of the Legislature; (viii) One other Muslim member; and (ix) An official.
('73', 458, 1, 3, 832515) The names of the members constituting the Committee will be announced as early as possible.
('73', 458, 1, 4, 832607) As an integral part of the scheme it shall be agreed and accepted between the Government, yourself and the Congress as follows : (1) That no attempt will be made hereafter by the Congress, or by any other body with the support, tacit or open, of the Congress to secure an advance upon these terms, and the matter shall cease to be a political issue;
('73', 458, 2, 5, 832957) (2) That you and the Congress will actively discourage all forms of agita tion for the accelerated release of prisoners, all attacks in the Press on the policy of Government in the matter of terrorist prisoners, all demonstrations and receptions on the release of such prisoners or thereafter, and all statements,writings and speeches favourable to terrorists or terrorism;
('73', 458, 3, 6, 833331) (3) That you and the Congress will take every step possible to create and maintain public opinion against hunger striking and will publicly condemn such a course if adopted.
('73', 458, 4, 7, 833505) In proposing these terms and conditions, the Government of Bengal have gone to the utmost limit which they consider to be compatible with the discharge of their responsibilities for the eradication of this canker of terrorism, which has for so long been a recurrent factor in the political life of the Province.
('73', 458, 4, 8, 833817) They have done so in the hope of mobilizing public opinion and of contributing to the creation and maintenance of the atmosphere calculated to render a recrudescence of terrorism unlikely.
('73', 458, 4, 9, 834006) Government earnestly desire the active association with themselves of all who genuinely wish for the ordered and non violent political development of the country.
('73', 458, 4, 10, 834169) Your own support I claim with the confidence of one who knows how much you have the same object at heart.
('73', 458, 4, 11, 834275) I should be glad, therefore, if you will be good enough to communicate your views on these proposals as early as possible, and I would suggest that it would be appropriate if you would communicate with Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose and the Leader of the Congress Party in the Legislative Assembly, Bengal, with a view to obtaining their acceptance.

('73', 459, 3, 5, 834734) July 25, 1938
('73', 459, 4, 6, 834748) I have already admitted an error of judgment committed by me in presenting my resignation to the Governor on the eve of the meeting of the Working Committee.
('73', 459, 4, 7, 834906) I admit that I have been guilty of indiscipline.
('73', 459, 4, 8, 834955) I, as an old Congressman, should have known the value of discipline.
('73', 459, 4, 9, 835024) I realize now 2 the enormity of the error, which has resulted in the dismissal of the Congress Ministers by the Governor under his constitutional powers under the Act 3.
('73', 459, 5, 10, 835194) I am sincerely sorry for what has happened on account of this loss of balance and I think that it is my duty to relinquish all positions of trust in the Congress, whose cause I have put in jeopardy by my action.
('73', 459, 5, 11, 835406) I shall be content if I am permitted to serve as a camp follower.
('73', 459, 5, 12, 835472) I shall do everything in my power to retrieve the prestige which the Congress has lost through my action.
('73', 459, 6, 13, 835578) I hope that all Congressmen will rally round the Working Committee in its endeavour to form a united and stable ministry, for there are rumours of a split in the Province between Maharashtra and Mahakoshal.
('73', 459, 6, 14, 835785) I hope that good counsels will prevail and we shall not think in terms of Maharashtra and Mahakoshal.
('73', 459, 6, 15, 835887) I shall try my best to prevent any such split.

('73', 459, 9, 18, 835965) WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON C. P. CRISIS 4
('73', 459, 10, 19, 836012) After having heard the Parliamentary Sub committee and given anxious consideration to the events that have happened since the agreement arrived at in Pachmarhi between the Ministers in the presence of the members of the Parliamentary Sub committee and the Presidents of the three Provincial Congress Committees concerned, and after having had several interviews with Dr. Khare, the Working Committee have reluctantly come to the conclusion that by the series of acts committed by Dr. Khare, culminating in his resignation of his charge and demanding the resignation of his colleagues of their charge, Dr. Khare was guilty of grave errors of judgment, which have exposed the Congress in the C. P. to ridicule and brought down its prestige.
('73', 459, 10, 20, 836751) He was also guilty of gross indiscipline in that he
('73', 459, 11, 21, 836803) 1 Vide Statement to the Press, 30 7 1938 and Statement to the Press, 5 9 1938 2 Now was deleted by Gandhiji.
('73', 459, 11, 22, 836912) 3 Under the Act was deleted by Gandhiji.

('73', 460, 0, 1, 837005) VOL. 73 : 21 FEBRUARY, 1938 8 SEPTEMBER, 1938 461
('73', 460, 1, 2, 837055) acted in spite of warnings against any precipitate action.
('73', 460, 2, 3, 837114) His resignation was the direct cause for the exercise, for the first time since
('73', 460, 3, 4, 837194) office acceptance by the Congress, by a Governor of his special powers, whereby Dr.
('73', 460, 4, 5, 837278) Khares three colleagues were dismissed.
('73', 460, 4, 6, 837318) The Working Committee note with
('73', 460, 5, 7, 837350) satisfaction that these three Congress Ministers showed their loyalty to the Congress
('73', 460, 6, 8, 837436) by declining, without instructions from the Parliamentary Sub committee, to tender
('73', 460, 7, 9, 837519) their resignations which were demanded by the Governor.
('73', 460, 8, 10, 837575) Dr. Khare was further guilty of indiscipline in accepting the invitation of the
('73', 460, 9, 11, 837655) Governor to form a new Ministry, and, contrary to the practice of which he was aware,
('73', 460, 10, 12, 837741) in actually forming a new Ministry and taking the oath of allegiance without
('73', 460, 11, 13, 837818) reference to the Parliamentary Sub committee, and the Working Committee, specially
('73', 460, 12, 14, 837901) when he knew that the meetings of these bodies were imminent.
('73', 460, 13, 15, 837963) By all these acts of his Dr. Khare has proved himself unworthy of holding
('73', 460, 14, 16, 838037) positions of responsibility in the Congress organization.
('73', 460, 14, 17, 838095) He should be so considered
('73', 460, 15, 18, 838122) till, by his services as a Congressman, he has shown himself well balanced and
('73', 460, 16, 19, 838201) capable of observing strict discipline and discharging the duties that may be
('73', 460, 17, 20, 838279) undertaken by him.
('73', 460, 18, 21, 838298) The working Committee have also come to the reluctant conclusion that H. E.
('73', 460, 19, 22, 838374) the Governor of the C. P. has shown, by the ugly haste with which he turned night
('73', 460, 20, 23, 838456) into day and forced the crisis that has overtaken the province, that he was eager to
('73', 460, 21, 24, 838541) weaken and discredit the Congress in so far as it lay in him to do so.
('73', 460, 21, 25, 838612) The Working
('73', 460, 22, 26, 838624) Committee hold that, knowing, as he must have, what was going on among members
('73', 460, 23, 27, 838703) of the Cabinet and the instructions of the Parliamentary Sub committee, he ought not
('73', 460, 24, 28, 838788) to have, with unseemly haste, accepted the resignation of the three Ministers and
('73', 460, 25, 29, 838870) demanded the resignation of the other three, dismissed them on their refusal to resign,
('73', 460, 26, 30, 838958) and immediately called upon Dr. Khare to form a new Ministry and sworn in the
('73', 460, 27, 31, 839036) available members of the new Ministry without waiting for the meeting of the
('73', 460, 28, 32, 839113) Working Committee which was imminent.
