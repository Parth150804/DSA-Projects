('41', 0, 1, 2, 41) 1. SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, CHICACOLE
('41', 0, 2, 3, 80) December 3, 1927
('41', 0, 3, 4, 97) You seem to be dividing all the good things with poor Utkal 1. I flattered myself with the assumption that my arrival here is one of the good things, for I was going to devote all the twenty days to seeing the skeletons of Orissa; but as you, the Andhras, are the gatekeepers of Orissa on this side, you have intercepted my march.
('41', 0, 3, 5, 428) But I am glad you have anticipated me also.
('41', 0, 3, 6, 472) After entering Andhra Desh, I have been doing my business with you and I know God will reward all those unknown people who have been co operating with me who am a self appointed representative of Daridranarayana.
('41', 0, 3, 7, 685) And here, too, you have been doing the same thing.
('41', 0, 3, 8, 736) Last night, several sister came and presented me with a purse.
('41', 0, 3, 9, 799) But let me tell you this is not after all my tour in Andhra.
('41', 0, 3, 10, 860) I am not going to let you alone so easily as this, nor will Deshabhakta Konda Venkatappayya let me alone, because I have toured in some parts of Ganjam.
('41', 0, 3, 11, 1013) I am under promise to tour Andhra during the early part of next year, and let me hope what you are doing is only a foretaste of what you are going to do next year.
('41', 0, 3, 12, 1177) You have faith in true non co operation.
('41', 0, 3, 13, 1218) There is the great drink evil, eating into the vitals of the labouring population.
('41', 0, 3, 14, 1301) I would like you to non co operate with that evil without a single thought and I make a sporting proposal, viz., that those who give up drink habit should divide their savings with me on behalf of Daridranarayan.
('41', 0, 3, 15, 1514) Then I see that many of you are making chimneys of your mouths by the vicious smoke habit.
('41', 0, 3, 16, 1605) You, who smoke, do not know what a filthy habit it is.
('41', 0, 3, 17, 1660) I saw that many of the people, when I made the appeal, threw away their cigars and cigarettes.
('41', 0, 3, 18, 1755) The elderly people by indulging in this vicious habit do not know what a legacy they are leaving to their children.
('41', 0, 3, 19, 1871) You know, as I know, that many children steal money in order to satisfy their curiosity to somke.
('41', 0, 3, 20, 1969) I ask you therefore to non co operate with the smoke habit, and again divide you savings with me.
('41', 0, 3, 21, 2067) So also must Hindus non co operate with the devil of un touchability.
('41', 0, 3, 22, 2137) I give you my assurance that devil is keeping us from God, and it is a barrier created for our own destruction.

('41', 1, 0, 1, 2275) 2 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 1, 1, 2, 2315) Mahatmaji then proceeded to answer some questions handed to him by someone in the audience.
('41', 1, 1, 3, 2407) The first question was: What are the means now to be adopted by young men for the uplift of the Mother country? Mahatmaji said: There are many things that I can suggest, but there is one thing which is the easiest for them to do and that is khadi work.
('41', 1, 1, 4, 2660) They can set apart a certain sum every month or every year to be devoted for khadi work.
('41', 1, 1, 5, 2749) If they have the time, they can devote it to organizing khadi work in their own district.
('41', 1, 1, 6, 2839) If they cannot do so or if they have given what is best in them.
('41', 1, 1, 7, 2904) If they cannot do so or if they have not confidence enough to be able to do organizing work, they can give half an hour a day to spinning and their yarn to the All India Spinners Association and become a member.
('41', 1, 2, 8, 3116) The second question dealt with the educational and other qualifications required for a public worker.
('41', 1, 2, 9, 3218) Mahatmaji said: So far as educational qualifications are concerned, besides knowing the provincial vernacular, they must know also the Rashtrabhasha 1Hindi.
('41', 1, 2, 10, 3375) But the other qualifications are even far more important.
('41', 1, 2, 11, 3433) They must be strictly honest and their private character must be pure.
('41', 1, 2, 12, 3504) Men whose eyes are not straight and whose heart is full of animal passion are not fit for doing political work.
('41', 1, 2, 13, 3616) And in my opinion, unless he believes in truth and non violence at any cost, he has no business to be a politician.
('41', 1, 3, 14, 3732) Answering the third question, Mahatmaji said : Whilst all our leaders are conceiving and cooking all kinds of schemes, we, the rank and file, cannot do better than achieving the message of khadi to its fullest extent.
('41', 1, 3, 15, 3950) It is not a small thing for you and me to take part in an effort to save sixty crores of rupees.
('41', 1, 3, 16, 4047) You and I cannot pack the Councils, Assembly and Municipalities.
('41', 1, 3, 17, 4112) Even if we would, we could not have all the qualifications.
('41', 1, 3, 18, 4172) But every one of us is born with the qualification for khadi.
('41', 1, 3, 19, 4234) It requires not much training except the training of the heart.
('41', 1, 3, 20, 4298) By doing khadi work you will find that the power is descending upon you.

('41', 2, 2, 3, 4471) Readers will recall that essays in English were invited on the subject of khadi, in view of the prize announced by Shri Revashanker Jagjivan 1. Accordingly, the essay written jointly by Professor Puntambekar and Shri Varadachari was awarded the prize.
('41', 2, 2, 4, 4723) As this is well worth study, it has been translated [into Gujarati] for the Jamnadas Bhagwandas Memorial Series.
('41', 2, 2, 5, 4836) Shri Chhaganlal Joshi of the Satyagraha Ashram has done the translation and it has now been published.
('41', 2, 2, 6, 4939) It is priced at Re.
('41', 2, 2, 7, 4959) 1. The total number of pages is 260. The translation runs into 215 pages, the rest being appendices.
('41', 2, 2, 8, 5060) All the apppendices are useful.
('41', 2, 2, 9, 5092) The last appendix gives a short history of khadi in Gujarat; in other words, it shows where khadi was formerly produced in Gujarat and how that priceless industry came to be ruined.
('41', 2, 2, 10, 5274) The language used in the translation is simple.
('41', 2, 2, 11, 5322) Gujarati readers will have no difficulty in understanding it.
('41', 2, 2, 12, 5384) Those who wish to understand well the secret underlying the activity of spinning must positively go through this book.

('41', 2, 4, 15, 5581) Decembr 4, 1927
('41', 2, 5, 16, 5597) SISTERS, You have presented two purses for the khadi work.
('41', 2, 5, 17, 5656) I acknowledge your present with gratitude.
('41', 2, 5, 18, 5699) You must not think that I consider some of you as Oriyas and some as Telugus.
('41', 2, 5, 19, 5777) You should feel that all are Indians.
('41', 2, 5, 20, 5815) Some say that they belong to Andhra and some say that they belong to Orissa.
('41', 2, 5, 21, 5892) Let all of you belong to India.
('41', 2, 5, 22, 5924) Let all of you share each others misery and happiness.
('41', 2, 5, 23, 5979) Only thus can you become like Sita.
('41', 2, 5, 24, 6015) Sita did not consider herself a citizen of Ayodhya.
('41', 2, 5, 25, 6067) She always considered hereself as belonging to the whole of India.
('41', 2, 5, 26, 6134) I am really glad that you have written this welcome address in the national language, that is, Hindi.
('41', 2, 5, 27, 6236) Let all of you give up foreign saris.
('41', 2, 5, 28, 6274) Let all of you use only khadi.
('41', 2, 5, 29, 6305) There is no necessity for a woman to wear beautiful saris and ornaments.
('41', 2, 5, 30, 6378) The only thing a woman needs is purity.
('41', 2, 5, 31, 6418) Let all of you wear khadi.
('41', 2, 5, 32, 6445) Let all of you be pure and truthful.

('41', 3, 1, 2, 6574) You should not consider anyone as untouchable.
('41', 3, 1, 3, 6621) In India, that is, Bharatvarsha, it is a great sin to consider anyone as an untouchable.
('41', 3, 1, 4, 6710) For heavens sake do not commit that sin.
('41', 3, 1, 5, 6751) Love those who are poor, diseased and hungry.
('41', 3, 1, 6, 6797) Let all of you prove that you love them by spinning yarn on the charkha for at least half an hour every day.
('41', 3, 1, 7, 6906) I appeal to those who have not contributed anything towards this Khadi Fund to contribute money or ornaments.

('41', 3, 2, 9, 7051) 4. SPEECH AT STUDENTS MEETING, BERHAMPUR
('41', 3, 3, 10, 7092) December 4, 1927
('41', 3, 4, 11, 7109) PROFESSORS, STUDENTS AND BROTHERS, Our programme in this meeting will be unlike the programmes followed in other meetings.
('41', 3, 4, 12, 7232) In our Satyagraha Ashram, for many years now, at 4.15 a.m.
('41', 3, 4, 13, 7291) in the morning and at 7 p.m.
('41', 3, 4, 14, 7320) in the evening, we hold congregational prayers.
('41', 3, 4, 15, 7368) When the Ashramites go to other places this schedule is observed even there.
('41', 3, 4, 16, 7445) Knowing that it is difficult to hold prayers at 7 p.m.
('41', 3, 4, 17, 7500) in the evening regularly [during tours], we have ruled that prayer must be held at night before going to bed.
('41', 3, 4, 18, 7610) On Friday, December 2, it was very late in the night when we entered into Ganjam district.
('41', 3, 4, 19, 7701) I forgot to pray before going to bed due to heavy work.
('41', 3, 4, 20, 7757) When I woke up in the dawn, I trembled in fear.
('41', 3, 4, 21, 7805) I could see that I had committed a great mistake before the Lord.
('41', 3, 4, 22, 7871) So we decided that anyone forgetting to offer prayers must do some kind of penance.
('41', 3, 4, 23, 7955) We also decided that wherever we were, we must remember the name of Rama at least once in the evening.
('41', 3, 4, 24, 8058) I was scheduled to come to this meeting at 7 p.m.
('41', 3, 4, 25, 8108) and we were supposed to pray together; but while coming the motor car from Chhatrapur I found that it was already 7 p.m.
('41', 3, 4, 26, 8229) So I prayed by myself in the motor car; but when we have decided on collective prayer, I beg you to pray here and now.
('41', 3, 4, 27, 8348) Those students and others who have faith in prayer, let them pray with closed eyes.
('41', 3, 4, 28, 8432) After the prayer, I will try to explain its utility.
('41', 3, 4, 29, 8485) Those who are unwilling to pray, I request them to sit quietly.
('41', 3, 5, 30, 8549) 1 The first two paragraphs are translated from The Samaj, an Oriya paper.
('41', 3, 5, 31, 8623) What follows is from Mahadev Desais Weekly Letter, published in Young India, 15 12 1927. Mahadev Desai adds: The students meeting had been timed at 7 p.m.
('41', 3, 5, 32, 8778) Although we did not reach the meeting at 7 and had to have our prayers whilst in motion, Gandhiji decided to have the congregational prayer at the meeting.
('41', 3, 5, 33, 8934) So we had it, the students keeping pin drop silence.
('41', 4, 0, 1, 8987) VOL. 41 : 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 5
('41', 4, 1, 2, 9028) As food is necessary for the body, prayer is necessary for the soul.
('41', 4, 1, 3, 9097) A man may be able to do without food for a number of days, as MacSwiney did for over 70 daysbut believing in God, man cannot, should not, live a moment without prayer.
('41', 4, 1, 4, 9265) You will say that we see lots of people living without prayer.
('41', 4, 1, 5, 9328) I dare say they do, but it is the existence of the brute which, for man, is worse than death.
('41', 4, 1, 6, 9422) I have not the shadow of a doubt that the strife and quarrels with which our atmosphere is so full today are due to the absence of the spirit of true prayer.
('41', 4, 1, 7, 9580) You will demur to the statement, I know, and contend that millions of Hindus, Mussalmans and Christians do offer their prayers.
('41', 4, 1, 8, 9708) It is because I had thought you would raise this objection that I used the words true prayers.
('41', 4, 1, 9, 9803) The fact is we have been offering our prayers with the lips but hardly ever with our hearts, and it is to escape, if possible, the hypocrisy of the lip prayer, that we in the Ashram repeat every evening the last verses of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.
('41', 4, 1, 10, 10066) The condition of the Equable in Spirit that is described in those verses, if we contemplate them daily, is bound slowly to turn our hearts towards God.
('41', 4, 1, 11, 10218) If you students would base your education on the true foundation of a pure character and pure heart there is nothing so helpful as to offer your prayers every day truly and religiously.

('41', 5, 3, 5, 10810) I have very little time to write today.
('41', 5, 3, 6, 10850) I am convinced that we should not permit jewels in the Ashram.
('41', 5, 3, 7, 10913) As long as there is terrible starvation in our land it is a sin for us to keep or to put on a ring weighing even a grain.
('41', 5, 3, 8, 11035) Our clothes must be just sufficient to cover our nakedness and to protect us against heat and cold.
('41', 5, 3, 9, 11135) All of you should try to reach this ideal.
('41', 5, 3, 10, 11178) I shall not write today about how the desire for ornaments arises.
('41', 5, 3, 11, 11245) It looks as though you have also not understood my question properly.
('41', 5, 3, 12, 11315) How is it that Lakshmibehn is ill?

('41', 5, 7, 17, 11482) December 5, 1927
('41', 5, 8, 18, 11499) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I missed one mail this time.
('41', 5, 8, 19, 11549) I could not attend to things regularly while I was in Ceylon.
('41', 5, 8, 20, 11611) There was plenty of travelling to do.
('41', 5, 8, 21, 11649) When, however, I miss a mail you should not feel worried or followed my example.
('41', 5, 8, 22, 11730) You will be free to miss a mail when both of you become as busy as I am if you have not learnt by then to get over my weaknesses.
('41', 5, 8, 23, 11860) Truly speaking, however, a real heir is one who enhances the legacy he has inherited.
('41', 5, 8, 24, 11946) Sushila is right when she says that in the realm of art there can be no distinction between indigenous and foreign, but her statement calls for some reflection.
('41', 5, 8, 25, 12107) Lovers of art take a superficial view of art and use it as a cover for many weaknesses.
('41', 5, 8, 26, 12195) We should, therefore, examine what we mean by art.
('41', 5, 8, 27, 12246) Not everything which appeals to the eye is art.
('41', 5, 8, 28, 12294) What is accepted as art by many expert may not be art.
('41', 5, 8, 29, 12349) I have read conflicting opinions about many paintings and statues

('41', 6, 1, 6, 12665) Sushila should read it.
('41', 6, 1, 7, 12689) If you cannot get it there, Please write to me.
('41', 6, 1, 8, 12737) Devdas suffered very much during his illness.
('41', 6, 1, 9, 12783) There is some affection in the nose.
('41', 6, 1, 10, 12820) There was temperature again.
('41', 6, 1, 11, 12849) He is better now.

('41', 6, 4, 16, 13008) [On or before December 6, 1927]
('41', 6, 5, 17, 13040) I am pining for a day when all this unhealthy competition between sister languages of India will have ceased.
('41', 6, 5, 18, 13150) Why should we not love all of them equally, as a brother holding a number of sisters in the same affection?
('41', 6, 5, 19, 13258) The result of the wretched competition has been that we forget our vernaculars and are jealous of others, and fondly believe that English would take the place of the common language of India, and even of the vernaculars.
('41', 6, 5, 20, 13479) Indeed a suggestion had come to me to address the meeting here in English.
('41', 6, 5, 21, 13554) Well, I take this as disaffection towards the daughter language of the motherland, and an unhealthy affection for a foreign tongue.
('41', 6, 5, 22, 13686) Not that I hate English, but I love Hindi more.
('41', 6, 5, 23, 13734) That is why I am beseeching the lettered classes of India to make Hindi their common language.
('41', 6, 5, 24, 13829) It is through Hindi that we can get into touch with and promote the growth of the other vernaculrs of the provinces.
('41', 6, 5, 25, 13946) If our intellects and hearts had not been atrophied owing to our having to learn through a foreign medium, there would be no reason why we should not all be knowing five or six vernaculars.
('41', 6, 5, 26, 14136) And my remarks regarding the competition betw een languages apply also to our narrow provincialism.
('41', 6, 5, 27, 14236) It is that provi

('41', 6, 6, 29, 14365) The lines enumerating the provinces including Madras and Utkal were mutilated by some parochial Andhra who had dropped Utkal and added Andhra instead !
('41', 6, 6, 30, 14517) The Chhatrapur meeting was the first quiet meeting we had after many noisy ones, and Gandhiji took an opportunity to animadvert upon this narrow spirit.

('41', 7, 1, 2, 14710) ncialism that has prevented the full growth of nationalism in us.
('41', 7, 1, 3, 14776) The golden rule for the promotion of nationalism is that the stronger should help and sacrifice for the weaker as much as is possible.
('41', 7, 1, 4, 14911) And now you will understand the rationale of khadi, which is intended to promote a healthy nationalism, and which embraces within its fold the poor and the downtrodden.

('41', 7, 3, 7, 15162) MAGANLAL, I got your letter.
('41', 7, 3, 8, 15191) I look forward to a letter from you on the due dates; if, however, I dont get one, I understand.
('41', 7, 3, 9, 15288) Your name is always on my lips.
('41', 7, 3, 10, 15320) When it becomes necessary to say anything unpleasant like a note out of tune, even then it will, in fact, be perfectly in tune since it will be the truth and truth is always in tune.
('41', 7, 3, 11, 15503) Do not, therefore, omit to tell me what you think I must be told.
('41', 7, 3, 12, 15569) I did not receive the letters which you mention.
('41', 7, 3, 13, 15618) Letters addressed to me do not generally get lost, but these ones at any rate did not reach me.
('41', 7, 3, 14, 15714) I am sure many errors remain in My Experiments with Truth.
('41', 7, 3, 15, 15773) I exercise great care but, when memory betrays me, to whom shall I complain about the misfortune?
('41', 7, 3, 16, 15871) Please to not omit to draw my attention to any fact, whether important or unimportant.
('41', 7, 3, 17, 15958) So tenacious is life, it does not leave even now. 2 I do fear this.
('41', 7, 3, 18, 16026) Mahadev, of course, sang the line for his own purpose.
('41', 7, 3, 19, 16081) You may hear the history behind it when he narrates it to you.
('41', 7, 3, 20, 16144) You have done very well in absorbing yourself in your present work.
('41', 7, 3, 21, 16212) 3 It is also a good thing that you get an opportunity to visit the Ashram form time to time.
('41', 7, 3, 22, 16305) Do continue to send your suggestions and criticisms.
('41', 7, 3, 23, 16358) Give your very life in making a model village a really model one; men with real life will then come and live in it.
('41', 7, 3, 24, 16474) Ba has gone there, that is, to live with Devdas.

('41', 8, 1, 2, 17001) 10. DISTORTION OF TRUTH A correspondent has been endeavouring with the help of the head master of a high school to introduce the teaching of the Gita among its boys.
('41', 8, 1, 3, 17167) But at a recent meeting convened to organize Gita readings a bank manager got up and disturbed the even tenor of the proceedings by saying that students had not the adhikara, qualification, for studying the Gita; it was not a play thing to be placed before students.
('41', 8, 1, 4, 17434) The correspondent sends me a long and argued letter about the incident and sends in support of his contention some apt saying from Ramakrishna Paramahamsa from which I cull the following :
('41', 8, 2, 5, 17623) Boys and youths should be encouraged to seek God.
('41', 8, 2, 6, 17673) They are like unpecked fruits, being totally untainted by worldly desires.
('41', 8, 2, 7, 17748) Once such desires have entered their minds, it is very difficult to make them tread the path to salvation.
('41', 8, 3, 8, 17855) Why do I love young men so much?
('41', 8, 3, 9, 17888) Because they are masters of the whole (16 annas) of their minds which get divided and sub divided as they grow up.
('41', 8, 3, 10, 18003) One half of the mind of a married man goes to his wife.
('41', 8, 3, 11, 18059) When a child is born it takes away one fourth (four annas), and the remaining one fourth (four annas) is scattered over parents, wordly honours, dress, etc.
('41', 8, 3, 12, 18216) Therefore a young mind can easily know God.
('41', 8, 3, 13, 18260) It is very difficult for old people to do so.
('41', 8, 4, 14, 18306) The parrot cannot be taught to sing if the membrane of its throat becomes hardened with age.
('41', 8, 4, 15, 18399) It must be taught while it is young.
('41', 8, 4, 16, 18436) Similarly, in old age it is difficult for the mind to be fixed on God.
('41', 8, 4, 17, 18507) It can be easily done so in youth.
('41', 8, 5, 18, 18542) If a seer of adulterated milk contains a chhatank (sixteenth part of a seer) of water, it can be thickened into kshira (condensed milk) with very little labour and consumption of fuel.
('41', 8, 5, 19, 18727) But should there be three paos (quarter seer) of water in a seer, the milk cannot be easily thickened and a large consumption of fuel will be required.
('41', 8, 5, 20, 18879) A young mind, being but slightly adulterated with worldly desires, can be easily turned towards God; this cannot be done with the minds of old people which are highly adulterated with such desires.
('41', 8, 6, 21, 19077) The tender bamboo can be easily bent, but the full grown bamboo breaks when an attempt is made to bend it.
('41', 8, 6, 22, 19184) It is easy to bend young hearts towards God, but the heart of the old escapes the hold when so drawn.
('41', 8, 7, 23, 19286) The human mind is like a package of mustard seed.
('41', 8, 7, 24, 19336) As it is very difficult to gather the seeds that escape out of a torn package and are scattered in all directions, so when the human mind runs in diverse directions and is occupied with many worldly things, it is not a very easy task to collect and concentrate
('41', 9, 0, 1, 19597) 10 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 9, 1, 2, 19638) The mind of a youth, not running in diverse directions, can be easily fixed on anything; but the mind of an old man being totally occupied with worldly things, it is very hard for him to draw it away from them and fix it on God.
('41', 9, 1, 3, 19867) I have heard of adhikara in connection with the Vedas, but I never knew that the Gita required the qualifications that the bank manager had in mind.
('41', 9, 1, 4, 20016) It would have been better if he had stated the nature of the qualifications he required.
('41', 9, 1, 5, 20105) The Gita clearly states that it is meant for all but scoffers.
('41', 9, 1, 6, 20168) If Hindu students may not read the Gita they may not read any religious works at all.
('41', 9, 1, 7, 20254) Indeed the original conception in Hinduism is that the student life is the life of a brahmachari who should begin it with a knowledge of religion coupled with practice so that he may digest what he learns and weave religious conduct into his life.
('41', 9, 1, 8, 20502) The student of old began to live his religion before he knew what it was, and this conduct was followed by due enlightenment, so that he might know the reason for the conduct prescribed for him.
('41', 9, 1, 9, 20697) Adhikara then there certainly was.
('41', 9, 1, 10, 20732) But it was the adhikara of right conduct known as the five yamas or cardinal restraintsahimsa (innocence), satya (truth), asteya (non stealing), aparigraha (non possession), and brahmacharya (celibacy).
('41', 9, 1, 11, 20935) These were the rules that had to be observed by anybody who wished to study religion.
('41', 9, 1, 12, 21021) He may not go to religious books for proving the necessity of these fundamentals of religion.
('41', 9, 1, 13, 21115) But today the word adhikara like many such potent words has suffered distortion, and a dissolute man, simply because he is called Brahmin, has adhikara to read and expound Shastras to us, whereas a man, if he is labelled an untouchable because of his birth in a particular state, no matter how virtuous he may be, may not read them.
('41', 9, 1, 14, 21448) But the author of the Mahabharata of which the Gita is a part wrote his great work for the purpose of meeting this insane objection, and made it accessible to all irrespective of the so called caste, provided, I presume, that he complied with the observances I have described: I add the qualifying expression I presume for, at the time of writing, I do not recall the observance of the yamas as a condition precedent to a person studying the Mahabharata.
('41', 9, 1, 15, 21903) Experience however shows that the purity of heart and the devotional frame of mind are necessary for a proper understanding of religious books.
('41', 9, 1, 16, 22047) The printing age has broken down all barriers and scoffers read
('41', 10, 0, 1, 22111) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 11
('41', 10, 1, 2, 22152) religious books with the same freedom (if not greater) that the religiously minded have.
('41', 10, 1, 3, 22241) But we are here discussing the propriety of students reading the Gita as per of religious instruction and devotional exercise.
('41', 10, 1, 4, 22368) Here I cannot imagine any class of persons more amenable to the restraints and thus more fitted than students for such instruction.
('41', 10, 1, 5, 22500) Unfortunately, it is to be admitted that neither the students nor the instructors in the majority of cases think anything of the real adhikara of the five restraints.

('41', 10, 3, 8, 22706) Here in Ceylon where I am writing for Young India amid surroundings where Nature has bountifully poured her richest treasures, I recall a letter written by a poetically inclined friend from similar scenes.
('41', 10, 3, 9, 22912) I share with the reader a paragraph from that letter.
('41', 10, 4, 10, 22966) A lovely morning!
('41', 10, 4, 11, 22984) Cool and cloudy, with a drowsy sun whose rays are as soft velvet.
('41', 10, 4, 12, 23050) It is a strangely quiet morningthere is a hush upon it, as of prayer.
('41', 10, 4, 13, 23120) And the mists are like incense, and the trees worshippers in a trance, and the birds and insects pilgrims come to chant bhajans.
('41', 10, 4, 14, 23249) how I wish one could learn true abandonment from Nature!
('41', 10, 4, 15, 23306) We seem to have forgotten our birthright to worship where and when and how we please.
('41', 10, 4, 16, 23392) We build temples and mosques and churches to keep our worship safe from prying eyes and away from outside influences, but we forget that walls have eyes and ears, and the roofs might be swarming with ghostswho know!
('41', 10, 4, 17, 23608) Good Gracious, I shall find myself preaching next!
('41', 10, 4, 18, 23659) How foolish, on a lovely morning like this?
('41', 10, 4, 19, 23703) A little child in the garden adjoining is singing as unconsciously and joyously as a bird.
('41', 10, 4, 20, 23794) I feel inclined to go and take the dust of its little feet.
('41', 10, 4, 21, 23854) And since I cannot pour out my heart in sound as simply as that little one, my only refuge is in silence!
('41', 10, 4, 22, 23960) Churches, mosques and temples, which cover so much hypocrisy and humbug and shut the poorest out of them, seem but a mockery of God and His worship, when one sees the eternally renewed temple of worship under the vast blue canopy inviting every one of us to real worship, instead of abusing His name by quarrelling in the name of religion.

('41', 11, 3, 4, 24415) MATHURADAS, I am having such a hectic time that I have no leisure at all.
('41', 11, 3, 5, 24489) Your letter has come to me here at an obscure place.
('41', 11, 3, 6, 24542) Now you must leave Pattani Sahebs bungalow, and that without intimating him.
('41', 11, 3, 7, 24619) You must inform him only after you have left.
('41', 11, 3, 8, 24665) Isnt that what we decided in Bombay?
('41', 11, 3, 9, 24702) If you must stay in Panchgani you must take whatever other accommodation you can get.
('41', 11, 3, 10, 24788) My advice is that you should only go to Almora or some place that side.
('41', 11, 3, 11, 24860) If Taramati refuses to go along, she must be left at Bombay.
('41', 11, 3, 12, 24921) As for Dilip, now he can be taken even without her.
('41', 11, 3, 13, 24973) The fact that you got temperature again suggests that you are still in a delicate state of health.
('41', 11, 3, 14, 25072) I am all right.

('41', 11, 6, 21, 25430) I had given up the idea of visiting Banpur, considering the advice of my doctors.
('41', 11, 6, 22, 25512) But, when I learnt that the Police were threatening the villagers and warning that if they come to the meeting they would be trampled upon by horses and shot down by soldiers, I resolved to come to Banpur.
('41', 11, 6, 23, 25718) Why should you fear?
('41', 11, 6, 24, 25739) A man who is innocent of crime need not fear.
('41', 11, 6, 25, 25785) And remember that there would be no one to frighten you if you refused to be afraid.
('41', 11, 6, 26, 25870) After all the policemen are our kith and kin.
('41', 11, 6, 27, 25916) When they come to intimidate you, ask them what they want to achieve thereby.
('41', 11, 6, 28, 25994) If they take you to jail do not resist them.
('41', 11, 6, 29, 26039) If they abuse you dont abuse you dont abuse them but laugh away.
('41', 11, 6, 30, 26104) If they belabour you, dont return blow for blow, but go and report the matter to the nearest representative of the people.

('41', 12, 1, 3, 26376) But if you feel that you must go to law you may.
('41', 12, 1, 4, 26425) Do not in any case be cowed down.
('41', 12, 1, 5, 26459) For fear is worse than disease.
('41', 12, 1, 6, 26491) The man who fears man falls from the state of man.
('41', 12, 1, 7, 26542) Fear God alone.
('41', 12, 1, 8, 26558) I am here until two oclock tomorrow.
('41', 12, 1, 9, 26595) You can come and tell me all you have to say.
('41', 12, 2, 10, 26641) Your address mentions that you have got no khadi work here.

('41', 12, 6, 24, 27397) 2 From the postmark 3 In August September 1927, the Bengal Nagpur Railway Administration decided to reduce the labour force in the Kharagpur Workshop by 1,600 hands.
('41', 12, 6, 25, 27563) The workmen adopted passive resistance.
('41', 12, 6, 26, 27603) The workshops were closed on 12th September and were reopened on 8th December when, as the result of an enquiry, some workmen who had been discharged were reinstated and in a few cases the compensation payable to the discharged workmen was enhanced (India in 1927 28, pp.

('41', 13, 2, 3, 27957) BOLGARH, December 10, 1927
('41', 13, 3, 4, 27984) MY DEAR C.R., You will be surprised to know that at least I have three days of quiet in a beautiful little village.
('41', 13, 3, 5, 28100) Before that the Ganjam programme was worse if possible even than the Ceylon programme, though it yielded twenty thousand.
('41', 13, 3, 6, 28222) Then a doctor came to take my blood pressure.
('41', 13, 3, 7, 28268) Niranjan Babu has made the same arrangements for examination of blood pressure that you had.
('41', 13, 3, 8, 28361) And when the doctor read 190, he got frightened and the whole of the programme has been rearranged.
('41', 13, 3, 9, 28461) Hence the rest.
('41', 13, 3, 10, 28477) Personally I am inclined to disbelieve the doctors reading.
('41', 13, 3, 11, 28537) However, even if it was wrong reading, it has done good.
('41', 13, 3, 12, 28594) A new doctor who has come today from Cuttack has read anything between 155 and 165. His own reading is between 155 and 160. Mahadev and Pyarelal read 165. The diastolic is 90 100. If these readings are correct, the blood pressure is the same as before, and there is nothing to worry.
('41', 13, 3, 13, 28878) However I am not writing this to tell you about the blood pressure.
('41', 13, 3, 14, 28946) Enough for you to now that I am all right.
('41', 13, 3, 15, 28989) I am dictating this in order to send you the enclosed.
('41', 13, 3, 16, 29044) If you can send someone to inspect the village and find out whether we can take up the proposition, please do so.
('41', 13, 3, 17, 29158) In any case correspond with the writer Mr. G. Subramaniam yourself.
('41', 13, 3, 18, 29226) I am sending him a postcard telling him that he may expect to hear from you.
('41', 13, 3, 19, 29303) I send you also Dr. Josephs letter.
('41', 13, 3, 20, 29339) His suggestion commends itself to me.
('41', 13, 3, 21, 29377) I think we must do some wor in Nagercoil, and unless you have anything to the contrary, please enter into correspondence with him telling him that his suggestion is acceptable and that it will be put before the Council of the Association 1 and you will let him know at an early date.
('41', 13, 3, 22, 29661) Meanwhile you may send the sample of yarn he wants.
('41', 13, 3, 23, 29713) We ought to be able to take up the yarn, and if there are local weavers, we may be able to get it woven there.
('41', 13, 3, 24, 29824) Please write to Dr. Joseph early.
('41', 13, 3, 25, 29858) I have told him that his suggestion commends itself to me and that I have forwarded his letter to you for consideration.

('41', 14, 4, 11, 30573) Disease wastes only the body, while fear destroys the soul; and men of fear cannot understand God.
('41', 14, 4, 12, 30672) He who is godfearing, takes the name of God, cannot fear men.
('41', 14, 4, 13, 30734) I cannot dismiss as untrue reports of friends who have informed me that you have been frightened by the Police and others who have told you that Government would arrest all those who came to me.
('41', 14, 4, 14, 30929) I am aware of nothing for which Government should make arrests and for aught I know Government has not till now asked people not to contribute to funds raised by me.
('41', 14, 4, 15, 31095) I understand that Orissa being poor, zamindars and officials want to keep people under fear for their own selfish interests.
('41', 14, 4, 16, 31220) I have found something striking in the atmosphere since Banpur.
('41', 14, 4, 17, 31284) I cannot make out how it will satisfy Government if people are kept off from me, or khadi work is interfered with, I cannot bear the thought that anyone should oppress another and feel ashamed that such poor unsophi sticated people receive such treatment.
('41', 14, 4, 18, 31540) I feel humiliated that whereas I cannot put up with oppression from foreigners, my own countrys zamindars or officials have been frightening people.
('41', 14, 4, 19, 31689) If the names of those who have been frightened are given to me I propose visiting them and if the names of the zamindars are also given I shall go and discuss the subject with them.
('41', 14, 4, 20, 31871) Fear is more deadly than diseases, and I ask them to give up fear, so that the work of those who frighten might automatically cease.
('41', 14, 4, 21, 32004) Give up drink, gambling and prostitution, so that you can be pure enough to attain God.
('41', 14, 4, 22, 32092) Though I have not come to raise purses in Orissa I do not hesitate to beg even from the poor for the sake of khadi.
('41', 14, 4, 23, 32208) May God bless you.

('41', 15, 2, 3, 32354) AS AT THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI December 11, 1927
('41', 15, 3, 4, 32400) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter 1 for which I thank you.
('41', 15, 3, 5, 32457) You may translate the book Self restraint v.
('41', 15, 3, 6, 32502) Self indulgence.
('41', 15, 3, 7, 32519) As to the terms, I leave them to you.
('41', 15, 3, 8, 32557) Whatever is given will be devoted to public use.
('41', 15, 3, 9, 32606) What you say about the women of the West is only partly true and true also perhaps to an extent for the women of India.
('41', 15, 3, 10, 32726) But these are society women and very few.
('41', 15, 3, 11, 32768) So far as the vast majority of women are concerned, they are too engrossed in their own occupations even to think of animal passions.
('41', 15, 3, 12, 32902) It is reserved for man to become aggressive when animal passion forces him.
('41', 15, 3, 13, 32978) What you say about passivity is unfortunately too true all the world over, and I do not know that the majority of women will ever be able to overcome that passivity.
('41', 15, 3, 14, 33144) Perhaps the very construction of their bodies prevents the development of active resistance except under certain well defined circumstances which are created by special culture.
('41', 15, 3, 15, 33322) And it is because woman is passive that I have contended that it is man who is the more to blame than woman.
('41', 15, 3, 16, 33431) And even the society woman of the West does not go beyond subtle attraction and blandishments.
('41', 15, 3, 17, 33526) I have not known many cases of violence done by women to men.
('41', 15, 3, 18, 33588) She has a remarkable capacity for controlling herself and pining away rather than be aggressive even under raging passion within her breast.
('41', 15, 4, 19, 33729) Your sincerely, M. ADA ROSENGREEN LIDINGO, SWEDEN

('41', 16, 2, 3, 33980) AS AT THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, December 11, 1927
('41', 16, 3, 4, 34027) DEAR FRIEND, I have your kind letter 1 and enclosures.
('41', 16, 3, 5, 34082) I do not feel that I can really write anything that would suit you.
('41', 16, 3, 6, 34150) You will therefore excuse me for not complying with your request.
('41', 16, 3, 7, 34216) So far as the question of child welfare is concerned, it is quite true to say that in the sense Lord Lytton means I have not interested myself in the problem, but in a sense, which I consider higher and which takes in not a few thousand children but millions of children, I am continually occupied in attending to their welfare.
('41', 16, 3, 8, 34545) For, the hand spinning movement is designed to affect the starving millions of this land including little children.
('41', 16, 3, 9, 34661) And if I succeed, I know that the child welfare of the type known to you and Lord Lytton is assured.
('41', 16, 3, 10, 34762) With reference to the printed sheet by you, it is difficult to reply to it because the writer has seen the same thing from a different angle of vision.
('41', 16, 3, 11, 34914) I have no desire therefore to enter upon a criticism of the writing which in accordance with your wish I return herewith.
('41', 16, 4, 12, 35036) Your sincerely, JUDGE HENRY NEIL

('41', 16, 8, 16, 35219) DEAR FRIEND, Owing to continuous travelling I have been able to reach your letter only today.
('41', 16, 8, 17, 35313) Whilst I have no hesitation about condemning the Devadasi institution, it would not be proper on my part to say
('41', 16, 9, 18, 35425) 1 The addressee, in his letter dated 8 10 1927, sought from Gandhiji a full and complete statement as to the effects of the teachings of Christ on the people of India and also his views on certain other matters.
('41', 17, 0, 1, 35637) 18 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 17, 1, 2, 35678) anything about your appeal seeing that I do not personally know any member of your society.
('41', 17, 1, 3, 35770) If you are unknown there, you are still more unknown to me.
('41', 17, 1, 4, 35830) Your duty therefore is to make yourselves known by your honest and strenuous work.
('41', 17, 1, 5, 35913) And I am sure that there will be benevolent men enough in Cochin to take up your cause.

('41', 17, 6, 10, 36183) DEAR FRIEND, Owing to my continuous wanderings I have not been able to reply to your letter earlier.
('41', 17, 6, 11, 36284) The time limit you have given me makes it well nigh impossible for me to overtake the task imposed by you on me.
('41', 17, 6, 12, 36397) Only Mahadev Desai can cope with the work, if I dont do it myself, but I have not the heart to add to the strain already put upon him.
('41', 17, 6, 13, 36532) Neither he nor I have a moment to spare till February.
('41', 17, 7, 14, 36587) Yours sincerely, PROF.

('41', 17, 10, 18, 36727) AS AT THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, December 11, 1927
('41', 17, 11, 19, 36774) DEAR FRIEND, I had your long letter.
('41', 17, 11, 20, 36811) It is not possible to prevent or regulate by pressure of public opinion the emigration of people in distress from one place to another, and it would be wrong to prevent it by legislation.
('41', 17, 11, 21, 36999) But wise ameliorative legislation in Ceylon can certainly

('41', 18, 1, 2, 37098) do a great deal to check evils inseparable from the immigration of poor labourers no matter to what race they belong.
('41', 18, 1, 3, 37216) You should create a public opinion in Ceylon which would demand from the employers of labour a humane treatment, payment of adequate wages and construction of sanitary and commodious dwellings.
('41', 18, 1, 4, 37410) Instead of regarding Indian labourers as foreigners, you should treat them as your own.
('41', 18, 1, 5, 37498) After all the labourers go to Ceylon because they are wanted.
('41', 18, 2, 6, 37560) Yours sincerely, J. N. JINENDRADAS 45, PARANAWADIYA ROAD MARADANA, COLOMBO From a microfilm: S.N. 12644

('41', 18, 4, 8, 37677) AS AT THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, December 11, 1927
('41', 18, 5, 9, 37724) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 18, 5, 10, 37757) I do not consider the embracing of Christianity as in any way essential for salvation.
('41', 18, 5, 11, 37844) I do not believe in the exclusive divinity of Jesus Christ.
('41', 18, 5, 12, 37904) I do not consider that the lives of all Roman Catholic bishops are above suspicion.
('41', 18, 5, 13, 37988) In my opinion, it is taking a low view of marriage to think that it involves indulgence in animal passion at the instance of either partner.
('41', 18, 5, 14, 38129) Marriage has far nobler uses.
('41', 18, 5, 15, 38159) I am not aware that religion enjoins upon one partner the obligation to indulge at the instance of another.
('41', 18, 5, 16, 38267) On the contrary, physical union is not permitted till both are equally desirous.
('41', 18, 6, 17, 38348) Yours sincerely, From a microfilm: S.N. 12645
('41', 18, 7, 18, 38394) 23. LETTER TO SRI PRAKASA
('41', 18, 8, 19, 38420) BOLGARH (ORISSA), December 11, 1927
('41', 18, 9, 20, 38456) MY DEAR SRI PRAKASA, You must forgive me for not replying to your letter for such a long time, but I have been worked beyond my strength and have had no time left for dealing with voluminous correspondence.
('41', 18, 9, 21, 38663) It is only
('41', 19, 0, 1, 38674) 20 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 19, 1, 2, 38715) because I am having enforced rest at an unknown and out of the way village in Utkal, that I am able to deal with the arrears, and in the natural course I have come upon your letter.
('41', 19, 1, 3, 38897) Here is the receipt sent to me with your letter from the Ashram.
('41', 19, 1, 4, 38962) The Aaj people should not complain.
('41', 19, 1, 5, 38998) Complimentary copies have been sent only to well known English papers.
('41', 19, 1, 6, 39069) Even well known friends have not been supplied with copies simply because after all Young India and Navajivan are at present very poor concerns.
('41', 19, 1, 7, 39214) They do not command the circulation of 1920 and 1921, and yet the rigid rule of remaining self supporting in spite of the handicaps in the shape of not taking advertisements, etc., is observed, and whenever there is anything left over from the running of these papers, the whole of it goes for public cause.
('41', 19, 1, 8, 39522) Should Aaj then expect a free copy, it would be simply taking so much out of poor peoples pockets.
('41', 19, 1, 9, 39621) If, in spite of this explanation, you or the workers at the Aaj office expect a free copy, tell me and I shall ask Swami Anand to send one.
('41', 19, 1, 10, 39761) Of course I know that Aaj is a leading paper on your side as is Basumati for instance in Calcutta.
('41', 19, 1, 11, 39860) But so far as I am aware, no vernacular paper has had the English copy.
('41', 19, 1, 12, 39932) Do please take me in your confidence either by letter or by coming to me.
('41', 19, 1, 13, 40006) I would love to share your burdens.
('41', 19, 1, 14, 40042) Do regard me therefore as a friend who would treasure your confidence and endeavour to lighten your burdens.
('41', 19, 1, 15, 40151) I am at Sabarmati in January.
('41', 19, 1, 16, 40181) I am sorry I shall have to go to Kathiawr for a few days during that month.
('41', 19, 1, 17, 40257) 1 But if you will be there for the whole of the month you can go with me to Kathiawar also and see that weird country.
('41', 19, 1, 18, 40376) Do take up the charkha regularly and once you have obtained mastery over it, you will not want to give it up, and it will be a faithful companion speaking to you only at your behest.
('41', 19, 1, 19, 40559) But you will find all the joy in the handling of it only if you will connect it and through it yourself with the meanest of our people.
('41', 19, 1, 20, 40695) And why should there be any shame in carrying on the takli, if there is no shame in identifying with the poorest.
('41', 19, 1, 21, 40809) I suppose you do know that the shepherds in Almora and in many other parts of India carry their taklis, spinning wool wherever they go.
('41', 19, 1, 22, 40945) Yours, SJT.

('41', 20, 2, 3, 41146) BOLGARH, ORISSA, December 11, 1927 When the mind is disturbed by impure thoughts, instead of trying to drive them out one should occupy it in some work, that is, engage it in purposeful thoughts.
('41', 20, 2, 4, 41342) Or one may engross it in Raman ama, engage it in reading or in some bodily labour which requires mental attention too.
('41', 20, 2, 5, 41461) Never let the eyes follow their inclination.
('41', 20, 2, 6, 41506) If they fall on a woman, withdraw them immediately.
('41', 20, 2, 7, 41558) It is scarcely necessary for anyone to look straight at a mans or womans face.
('41', 20, 2, 8, 41637) This is the reason why brahmacharis, and others too, are enjoined to walk with their eyes lowered.
('41', 20, 2, 9, 41736) If we are sitting, we should keep steady in one direction.
('41', 20, 2, 10, 41795) This is an external remedy, but a most valuable one.
('41', 20, 2, 11, 41848) You may undertake a fast if and when you find one necessary.
('41', 20, 2, 12, 41909) It is not necessary for you to go to Satavalekarji.
('41', 20, 2, 13, 41961) He will certai nly teach you some asanas.
('41', 20, 2, 14, 42003) If you wish to go to him to learn them, you may certainly do so.
('41', 20, 2, 15, 42068) I know him very well.
('41', 20, 2, 16, 42090) He is a fine man.
('41', 20, 2, 17, 42108) You should not be afraid even if you get involuntary discharges during a fast.
('41', 20, 2, 18, 42187) Vaids say that, even when impure desires are absent, such discharges occur because of pressure in the bowels.
('41', 20, 2, 19, 42297) But, instead of believing that, it helps us more to believe that they occur because of impure desires.
('41', 20, 2, 20, 42400) We are not always conscious of such desires.
('41', 20, 2, 21, 42445) I had an involuntary discharge in sleep twice during the last two weeks.
('41', 20, 2, 22, 42518) I cannot recall any dream.
('41', 20, 2, 23, 42545) I never practised masturbation.
('41', 20, 2, 24, 42577) One cause of these discharge is of course my physical weakness, but I also know that there are impure desires deep down in me.
('41', 20, 2, 25, 42704) I am able to keep out such thoughts during waking hours.
('41', 20, 2, 26, 42761) But what is present in the body like some hidden posion, always makes its way, even forcibly sometimes.
('41', 20, 2, 27, 42865) I feel unhappy about this, but am not nervously afraid.
('41', 20, 2, 28, 42921) I am always vigilant.
('41', 20, 2, 29, 42943) I can suppress the enemy but have not been able to expel him altogether.
('41', 20, 2, 30, 43016) If I am truthful, I shall succeed in doing that too.
('41', 20, 2, 31, 43069) The enemy will not be able to endure the power of truth.
('41', 20, 2, 32, 43126) If you are in the same condition as I am, learn from my experience.
('41', 20, 2, 33, 43194) In its essence, desire for sex pleasure is equally impure, whether its object is ones wife or some other woman.
('41', 20, 2, 34, 43306) Its results differ.
('41', 20, 2, 35, 43326) At the moment, we are thinking of the enemy in his essential nature.
('41', 20, 2, 36, 43395) Understand, therefore, that so far as ones wife is concerned you are not likely to find anyone as lustful as I was.
('41', 20, 2, 37, 43511) That is why I have described my
('41', 21, 0, 1, 43543) 22 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 21, 1, 2, 43584) pitiable condition to you and tried to give you courage.
('41', 21, 1, 3, 43641) If Ba is as a mother to me now, this is the result of long struggle and Gods grace.
('41', 21, 1, 4, 43725) The legacy of that unclean life, however, afflicts me.
('41', 21, 1, 5, 43780) I, in return, try to overcome it and, with Gods grace, shall overcome it in this very life.

('41', 21, 5, 11, 44002) I have been thinking about him constantly.
('41', 21, 5, 12, 44045) His wife is very intractable and very obstinate.
('41', 21, 5, 13, 44094) On the whole therefore if he works at the Ashram, i.e., in Gujarat, for the time being, it will relieve Narandas of some anxiety.
('41', 21, 5, 14, 44224) On further considering the matter, I think it will be better till we meet to postpone setting apart sums for mother and Kishan.
('41', 21, 5, 15, 44352) I would make some other suggestions.

('41', 21, 8, 19, 44500) BOLGARH, Silence Day, December 12, 1927
('41', 21, 9, 20, 44540) SISTERS, There is profound solitude around me, but it is the solitude of a sick mans room.
('41', 21, 9, 21, 44631) When I see the state of people here my heart burns within me, and I very much long to stay on here.
('41', 21, 9, 22, 44731) If any of you is willing to come here, I would invite her to do so.
('41', 21, 9, 23, 44799) All the women here observe purdah.
('41', 21, 9, 24, 44834) The people have neither enough clothes to wear nor food to eat.
('41', 21, 9, 25, 44898) When Mirabehn suggested, before I went to Orissa, that it was our duty to put on still fewer clothes, I felt embarrassed.
('41', 21, 9, 26, 45020) But when I see things here, I feel that her suggestion was indeed proper.
('41', 21, 9, 27, 45094) Women here put on only one dhoti, one half covers the lower part, and the other half the upper part of their bodies.
('41', 21, 9, 28, 45211) They get neither milk nor ghee.
('41', 21, 9, 29, 45243) They are terror stricken.
('41', 21, 9, 30, 45269) Because of some policemans threat, they do not even come anywhere near me.
('41', 21, 9, 31, 45344) I left Mirabehn in a house
('41', 21, 10, 32, 45371) 1 This was written on the letter head of the All Parties Convention, Allahabad which was held on 11 12 1927.

('41', 22, 1, 2, 45521) and went out; immediately about fifty women surrounded her and began to ask her questions.
('41', 22, 1, 3, 45612) If someone of you is willing to work here among these women, she can, I am sure, do a great deal.
('41', 22, 1, 4, 45710) But all this is about the future.
('41', 22, 1, 5, 45744) For the present, all of you should get fully trained.
('41', 22, 1, 6, 45798) Training means forgetting oneself.
('41', 22, 1, 7, 45833) If you do that, you can then go anywhere you like.

('41', 22, 6, 12, 46014) CHHAGANLAL I had your letter.
('41', 22, 6, 13, 46044) Today I am in an unknown village of Utkal.
('41', 22, 6, 14, 46087) There is so much to do here that I myself feel like devoting some time.
('41', 22, 6, 15, 46159) Tomorrow, I will reach the place where there were floods.
('41', 22, 6, 16, 46217) What I will get to see there will be something different.
('41', 22, 6, 17, 46275) Will you come here if I want to utilize your services?
('41', 22, 6, 18, 46330) Perhaps it would be necessary to keep someone in the affected area to supervise the work.
('41', 22, 6, 19, 46420) He has to maintain the accounts, too.
('41', 22, 6, 20, 46458) Is there a marked improvement in your health there?
('41', 22, 6, 21, 46510) Has the mental fatigue gone?
('41', 22, 6, 22, 46539) There are certain difficulties in Nimus marriage 2 but I would not involve you in those worries.
('41', 22, 6, 23, 46636) I am writing to Lakhtar.
('41', 22, 6, 24, 46661) I expect to reach the Ashram on January 1 or before that.
('41', 22, 7, 25, 46719) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] Now send your letters to Madras.
('41', 22, 7, 26, 46778) The best address is: Hindi Prachar Office Triplicane, Madras.
('41', 22, 7, 27, 46840) There, too, I would not stay for more than five days.

('41', 23, 2, 3, 47353) BHAI RAMESHCHANDRAJI, I preserved your letter till now in the hope of answering it.
('41', 23, 2, 4, 47437) Only today can I do so.
('41', 23, 2, 5, 47461) Eating flesh and eating vegetables both involve violence but without the latter man can survive nowhere, while without the former he can ordinarily survive anywhere.
('41', 23, 2, 6, 47627) If sensitivity to pain differs among creatures, the pain experienced by a cow in the throes of death cannot be experienced by plants.
('41', 23, 2, 7, 47761) For all living beings, violence in some form is unavoidable.
('41', 23, 2, 8, 47822) The votary of non violence will commit the minimum of violence.
('41', 23, 2, 9, 47886) The other religions do not enjoin flesh eating; they just do not forbid it.
('41', 23, 2, 10, 47962) It is well to know the custom in the other religions or even in Hindu dharma, but if our reason considers vegetarianism superior from the moral point of view, we must accept it.
('41', 23, 2, 11, 48140) The votary of non violence will progressively restrict himself, even in the use of vegetables.
('41', 23, 2, 12, 48235) It is difficult, not impossible, to remain a vegetarian in places like Greenland.
('41', 23, 2, 13, 48317) Even if proved impossible, it cannot establish the necessity of flesh eating everywhere.
('41', 23, 2, 14, 48406) Though our acts are seldom without a fault, we abstain from many on the basis of comparative merit.
('41', 23, 2, 15, 48506) Abstinence is constantly on the increase in the life of a seeker after moksha, and it is essential too.
('41', 23, 2, 16, 48610) Eggs and milk differ.
('41', 23, 2, 17, 48632) Eggs are not essential.
('41', 23, 2, 18, 48656) Milk too is not essential for crores of people.
('41', 23, 2, 19, 48704) I have eaten eggs in England under a delusion, as I ate meat in India.
('41', 23, 2, 20, 48775) But on coming to my senses I left them and even in the company of vegetarian friends I accepted only those dishes that did not contain eggs.
('41', 23, 2, 21, 48916) I have now come to know that a great number of unfertilized eggs are laid.
('41', 23, 2, 22, 48991) This can be systematically checked and generally unfertilized eggs alone are eaten.
('41', 23, 2, 23, 49075) But this cannot make eggs an item of our food.
('41', 23, 2, 24, 49122) Non violence is a comprehensive dharma.
('41', 23, 2, 25, 49162) Violence does not consist only in taking life away from the body.
('41', 23, 2, 26, 49228) Abandoning brahm acharya too is violence in my eyes.
('41', 23, 2, 27, 49281) It is well known that a brahm achari must abstain from fleshdiet, eggs and milk too.
('41', 23, 2, 28, 49366) Brahm acharya is more easily attainable with vegetable diet alone.
('41', 23, 2, 29, 49433) In conclusion, though the question of diet is very important for a religious man, yet it is not the be all and end all of religion or non violence; nor is it the most vital factor.
('41', 23, 2, 30, 49614) The observance of religion and

('41', 24, 1, 2, 49686) non violence has more to do with the heart.
('41', 24, 1, 3, 49730) He who does not feel the necessity of abstaining from meat for inner purification need not abstain from it.

('41', 24, 7, 11, 50140) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter written on the train.
('41', 24, 7, 12, 50194) It is pathetic, for, though I believe that I have a most accommodating temperament, I see vital differences between us, where you seem to say only differences in mere matters of detail.
('41', 24, 7, 13, 50380) Our outlooks appear to me to be wholly different.
('41', 24, 7, 14, 50430) Whereas you have before your minds eye that microscopic minority, the educated Indian, I have before my minds eye the lowliest illiterate India living outside the railway beat.
('41', 24, 7, 15, 50607) Important as the former class undoubtedly is, it has no importance in my estimation except in terms of the latter and for the sake of the latter.
('41', 24, 7, 16, 50753) The educated class can justify its existence only if it is willing to sacrifice itself for the mass.
('41', 24, 7, 17, 50854) Your scheme therefore makes no appeal to me.
('41', 24, 7, 18, 50899) I have read Sir P. C. Rays preface and I have read the other writings you have been sending me; but though I admire these great men, they cannot move me from my fundamental position.
('41', 24, 7, 19, 51082) I want you therefore to recognize the fundamental difference between us and love me in spite of that difference if you can.
('41', 24, 7, 20, 51206) For my part, the existence of that difference does not prevent me from loving you and therefore writing to you as often as I can in reply to your communications and striving

('41', 25, 6, 7, 51725) BHAI RATILAL, Chi.
('41', 25, 6, 8, 51744) Narandas has sent me your letter.
('41', 25, 6, 9, 51778) It is good you wrote to me.
('41', 25, 6, 10, 51806) Mathurads had given me news of Sakubhais illness when I was in Bombay.
('41', 25, 6, 11, 51877) But I did not think it was anything serious.
('41', 25, 6, 12, 51922) Of course a T.B. patient has to be extremely careful.
('41', 25, 6, 13, 51976) Therefore please make arrangements so that proper care is taken of him.
('41', 25, 6, 14, 52048) Inform me regularly.
('41', 25, 6, 15, 52069) Give the enclosed letter 2 to Sakubhai if you think it proper.
('41', 25, 6, 16, 52132) I have sent a wire today.

('41', 25, 10, 21, 52280) Wednesday [December 14, 1927] 3
('41', 25, 11, 22, 52312) BHAISHRI S. SAKUBHAI, I have been distressed to read about the deterioration in your health.
('41', 25, 11, 23, 52405) Get well quickly now.
('41', 25, 11, 24, 52427) Illness is inseparable from the body.
('41', 25, 11, 25, 52465) Therefore while we should try to overcome illness we must not be scared of it or worry on account of it.
('41', 25, 11, 26, 52570) Illness can only end in death.
('41', 25, 11, 27, 52601) That also is our companion from birth.
('41', 25, 11, 28, 52640) Therefore we should ever be prepared to embrace it.
('41', 25, 11, 29, 52692) Death is not extinction but only a change of state.
('41', 25, 11, 30, 52744) I want you to ponder this so that fear of death does not make

('41', 26, 1, 4, 53085) If we remain light hearted and cheerful it helps to overcome the illness.
('41', 26, 1, 5, 53159) I want you to get well soon and be free from anxiety.

('41', 26, 4, 9, 53323) Do you agree that it is the primary duty of an ideal Government and more so of a Great Soul to put down the wicked and to protect the righteous?
('41', 26, 4, 10, 53468) If so, may we know how your political philosophy is consistent with this age long dictum?
('41', 26, 4, 11, 53558) Was not this the keynote of Shri Krishnas preaching to Arjuna on the battle field of Kurukshetra?
('41', 26, 5, 12, 53656) Was this not the shrewd policy of the avataras 1, that brought about the dethronement of the renowned Bali, the destruction of Vali, and the annihilation of Jarasandha?
('41', 26, 6, 13, 53825) How can you expect ordinary mortals, and and that too large numbers at a time, to withstand the attacks of unscrupulous enemies without retaliation?
('41', 26, 6, 14, 53974) In view of the above, are we not justified in considering your emotional preachings and teachings as impracticable and not within the realization of ordinary persons?
('41', 26, 6, 15, 54141) Your temporary and piecemeal success in South Africa had been exaggerated greatly by your admirers, and the Indians of average intelligence, innocently (sheep like) following your lead, have been entangled in difficulties, not realizing that the parrallel of South Africa does not hold good in the case of a vast country of different languages and religious sections like India.
('41', 26, 6, 16, 54520) Have you not yourself realized, at the cost of the life interests of a large number of young patriots, that all your talk of swaraj within a year has proved vainglorious?
('41', 26, 6, 17, 54691) Dont you admit that your somersault 2
('41', 26, 7, 18, 54729) in the Bardoli 3 affair caused much havoc to the people of Guntur who boldly and manfully withheld payment of taxes for a considerable period, 4 in pursuance of your programme?

('41', 27, 1, 2, 55378) and the consequent playing of the Congress into the hands of a few fanatical Mussalmans?
('41', 27, 1, 3, 55467) Has not the Hindu Muslim unity of which you spoke and wrote so much, and in the name which you appealed to all Hindus to join their Mohammedan brethren in the hour of their trial, proved a veritable castle of cards, the moment the need of the Mohammedans was over?
('41', 27, 1, 4, 55732) Can you ever expect by your pious teachings to bring about any real unity between the bigoted and brave Mohammedans and caste ridden and timid Hindus?
('41', 27, 1, 5, 55883) Have you ever realized the fact that the communal feuds are increasing all the more, ever since you came into prominence in the Congress by virtue of your creed of non violence?
('41', 27, 2, 6, 56061) Will you not admit that Pandit Malaviya, C. R. Das, Lala Lajpat Rai, Vijayaraghavachariar, Kelkar, Dr. Moonje and other all India leaders were disgusted with your political philosophy, however much it might be garbed in the language of dharma?
('41', 27, 3, 7, 56305) Have you not recognized the leadership of that great soul Tilak at least at the beginning?
('41', 27, 3, 8, 56396) But how is it, you are today raking up intricate controversies of a social and religious character, to the detriment of the national cause?
('41', 27, 3, 9, 56536) Do you not realize that these tend only to accentuate dissensions all the more among the docile Hindus?
('41', 27, 3, 10, 56640) Are you not thereby indirectly playing into the hands of the enemies of our cause, whose one argument against us is that we are socially unfit for poliitcal freedom?
('41', 27, 4, 11, 56806) It is worthy on your part to set up and encourage Panchamas to enter the holy temples of caste Hindus for whom and by whom they were built exclusively?
('41', 27, 4, 12, 56958) Do you consider yourself to be a Trinetra (God Rudra) to set at naught those time honoured customs at one stroke?
('41', 27, 4, 13, 57072) Rcently, we are surprised to note that you have taken up the the cause of widows and boldly advised immature youths to marry widows.
('41', 27, 4, 14, 57205) Dont you consider that Swami Vivekananda and others were prudent enough not to advocate widow marriage as they realized the the difficulties which confront us even in the case of the marriages of maids, as they are taking place today?
('41', 27, 4, 15, 57440) May we know how far it will help to create harmony by mixing up such highly controversial problems with the question of swaraj which is purely political and on which all of us are expected to make a united stand?
('41', 27, 5, 16, 57653) Your charkha cannot be popularized in this advanced age of science.
('41', 27, 5, 17, 57721) Dont you think that you will do well, in the light of practical experience, to confine your activities to the field of labour organizations?
('41', 27, 6, 18, 57862) As a real believer in ahimsa dharma is it not your clear duty to refuse addresses from municipalities which are harbouring slaughter houses?
('41', 27, 6, 19, 58003) The foregoing is a condensation of a letter sent to me by a
('41', 28, 0, 1, 58063) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 29
('41', 28, 1, 2, 58104) correspondent while I was in Berhampur.
('41', 28, 1, 3, 58144) As I have reason to think that the correspondent has boldly voiced what many are harbouring in their breasts, I feel that the indictment deserves an answer.
('41', 28, 1, 4, 58301) It is hardly necessary to answer he questions in detail.
('41', 28, 1, 5, 58358) Many of us make the very serious mistake of taking literally what is accepted as scriptures, forgetting that the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life.
('41', 28, 1, 6, 58514) The Mahabharata and the Puranas are neither history nor simple religious maxims.
('41', 28, 1, 7, 58595) They appear to me to be wonderfully designed to illustrate the religious history of man in a variety of ways.
('41', 28, 1, 8, 58705) The heroes described therein are all imperfect mortals, even as we arethe difference being one of degree only.
('41', 28, 1, 9, 58816) Their alleged actions are not infallible guides for us.
('41', 28, 1, 10, 58872) The Mahabharata sums up its teachings by declaring emphatically that truth outweighs everything else on earth.
('41', 28, 1, 11, 58983) But I do no seek to justify everything written under the name of scriptures.
('41', 28, 1, 12, 59060) I take, as all to be true must take, the sum total of the effect produced on me by a prayerful reading of such books.
('41', 28, 1, 13, 59178) Thus I hold that my belief in truth and non violence is derived from and bases on the scriptural teaching of the very books from which the correspondent presents me with conundrums.
('41', 28, 1, 14, 59360) Nay more, my belief today having become part of my fundamental being is capable of standing independent of these books or any other Surely there must come a time in the life of a very religiously minded man when his faith must be self sustained.
('41', 28, 1, 15, 59606) Whatever therefore the avataras may be proved to have done or not done is of little moment to me.
('41', 28, 1, 16, 59704) My experience daily growing stronger and richer tells me that there is no peace for individuals or for nations without practising truth and non violence to the uttermost extent possible for man.
('41', 28, 1, 17, 59899) The policy of retaliation has never succeeded.
('41', 28, 1, 18, 59946) We must not be confounded by the isolated illustrations of retaliation, including frauds and force, having attained temporary and seeming success.
('41', 28, 1, 19, 60093) The world lives because there is more love than hate, more truth than untruth in it.
('41', 28, 1, 20, 60178) This is a proposition capable of being verified by everyone who will take the trouble to think.
('41', 28, 1, 21, 60274) Fraud and force are diseases, truth and non violence is health.
('41', 28, 1, 22, 60338) The fact that the world has not perished is an ocular demonstration of the fact that there is more health than disease in it.
('41', 28, 1, 23, 60464) Let us, then, who realize this, live up to the rules of health even in the midst of circumstances the most adverse.
('41', 28, 1, 24, 60580) My preaching and teaching are not emotional or unpractical, for I teach what is ancient and strive to practice what I preach.
('41', 29, 0, 1, 60706) 30 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 29, 1, 2, 60747) claim that what I practise is capable of being practised by all, because I am a very ordinary mortal open to the same temptations and liable to the same weaknesses as the least among us.
('41', 29, 1, 3, 60934) The success in South Africa was complete according to the standard then aimed at.
('41', 29, 1, 4, 61016) And what is true of small groups must be true of larger groups with correspondingly larger effort of the same types.
('41', 29, 1, 5, 61133) I have faith enough in my method to be able to prophesy that posterity will consider the years 1920 and 1921 as among the most brilliant in the pages Indias history, and among them the Bardoli somersault the most brilliant of all.
('41', 29, 1, 6, 61364) The Bardoli decision has enabled India to look the world square in the face and to hold up her head.
('41', 29, 1, 7, 61465) With her creed in the Congress constitution, it was the only correct, bold and honourable course for the nation to take.
('41', 29, 1, 8, 61586) The battle for swaraj was no camouflage.
('41', 29, 1, 9, 61627) And if any suffered involuntarily, they suffered because they played with fire.
('41', 29, 1, 10, 61707) The participation in the Khilafat agitation has made both the parties strong and has resulted in a mass awakening which would have otherwise taken ages.
('41', 29, 1, 11, 61860) If real uniy is to come, it will come only by a due adherence to my teachings.
('41', 29, 1, 12, 61939) The present Hindu Muslim feuds and inter Hindu feuds and even inter Muslim feuds are a sign of the mass awakening.
('41', 29, 1, 13, 62054) What we see happening today is nothing but the coming of dirt to the surface in the process of purification.
('41', 29, 1, 14, 62163) Let the correspondent watch the process going on in a sugar refinery, and he will understand my meaning.
('41', 29, 1, 15, 62268) This froth in the shape of feuds had come to the surface only to be thrown out in the end.
('41', 29, 1, 16, 62359) I am unaware of the fact that Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji and the other leaders mentioned by the correspondent are disgusted with my political philosophy.
('41', 29, 1, 17, 62516) Of some at least I know to the contrary.
('41', 29, 1, 18, 62557) But even if they are disgusted I hope that my faith will stand the strain of the disgust of all friends whose opinion I have learnt to value and cherish.
('41', 29, 1, 19, 62711) The correspondent betrays his ignorance of the Lokamanya when he imputes to him policies which I know he was never guilty of.

('41', 30, 1, 6, 63670) When I receive addresses from municipalities, I claim to remain untouched by the slaughter in the municipal slaughter houses.

('41', 30, 3, 10, 64110) DEAR FRIEND, I had your letter 1. I have not any time at my disposal to send you a long message, but this I can say.
('41', 30, 3, 11, 64227) The present and the future policy of the Anglo Indian community should be not to strive for recognition as Europeans, but strive to make common cause with Indias masses to whom they owe everything.
('41', 30, 3, 12, 64425) The fact of European blood should be treated as a handicap and turned to good account not by aping the superficial veneer of Europe, but by striving to assimilate the good qualities of the Europeans and sharing them with the masses.
('41', 30, 3, 13, 64658) The attempt on the part of some Anglo Indians to treat themselves as a class apart and wrest special privileges will be found in the end to be vain and inglorious.
('41', 30, 4, 14, 64822) Yours sincerely, LT.

('41', 31, 3, 4, 65137) DEAR FRIEND, I have secured from Deshbhakta Venkatappayya the names of these Andhra friends who gave proper legal guarantees for the moneys advanced by the Khadi Board, now Charkha Sangh, for khadi work.
('41', 31, 3, 5, 65341) I understand that you are one of these guarantors and that there is difficulty in securing payment from you.
('41', 31, 3, 6, 65450) I would make a fervent appeal to you to discharge your obligation which is not merely legal but also moral.
('41', 31, 3, 7, 65558) And we who profess to serve the country are in my opinion more bound by moral obligations even than by those that are merely legal.
('41', 31, 3, 8, 65690) I therefore hope that you will discharge this obligation as if it was a first charge upon all your assets and induce other friends to discharge their responsibility.

('41', 32, 8, 14, 67413) Some readers have made a request that articles written by Shri Valji Desai on cow protection, in Gujarati in the Navajivan and in English in Young India, may be published in book form.
('41', 32, 8, 15, 67598) Shri Rameshwardas of Dhulia has promised to contribute Rs. 35 towards the expense.
('41', 32, 8, 16, 67681) It is doubtful whether the book would fetch the cost of publication; hence it could be published only if other cow lovers contribute towards the cost.
('41', 32, 8, 17, 67832) It is not possible for the Navajivan to undertake this venture without others help.
('41', 32, 8, 18, 67916) The funds at the disposal of the All India Cow protection Association are not sufficient to meet the expenses of its constructive activities; hence, I do not dare to meet the deficit out of these funds.
('41', 32, 8, 19, 68119) The book will be published immediately if readers send in small contributions.

('41', 33, 5, 6, 68563) MY DEAR THIRUKOOTASUNDARAM, I received your letter 1 when I was about to finish the Ceylon visit.
('41', 33, 5, 7, 68661) I could not reply to you earlier as your letter was mislaid and therefore escaped my attention.
('41', 33, 5, 8, 68757) I have made full enquiry into the matter and I have come to the conclusion that Sjt.
('41', 33, 5, 9, 68842) Varadachari counted the purse as soon as it was humanly possible.
('41', 33, 5, 10, 68908) In rapid tours, it is not possible to count purses in the presence of donors or even during the night of the day on which the purses are received.
('41', 33, 5, 11, 69055) The donors give purses only when they have full confidence in the integrity of the donees and their ability to choose honest instrumentsfor their keep as well as disposal.
('41', 33, 5, 12, 69227) This is not the first time that the purses have been found to contain less than the amounts announced, and the deficiencies occur often without any fault of the persons who keep the purses before they find themselves into the hands of the donees.
('41', 33, 5, 13, 69474) All the consolation therefore that I can give you is that you should not agitate yourself over the deficiency.
('41', 33, 5, 14, 69585) It means no reflection on you, nor should it carry and reflection upon those who are associated with me in the conduct of the khadi organization.
('41', 33, 5, 15, 69731) Varadachari is one of the most trusted amongst khadi workers and I assure you that you have no reason whatsoever to suspect his honesty or doubt his diligence.
('41', 33, 5, 16, 69891) I had not known a more eiligent and honest worker in the All India Spinners Association.
('41', 33, 5, 17, 69980) He tells me that he did count the purse at Palamcottah, but you were not available after he had counted the purse.
('41', 33, 5, 18, 70095) There is evidently therefore some misunderstanding regarding the date of counting as understood by Sjt.

('41', 34, 5, 7, 70664) CUTTACK, Sunday [December 18, 1927] 1
('41', 34, 6, 8, 70702) CHHAGANLAL, I have been able to read carefully the copies of the articles on sugar and malaria sent by you only today.
('41', 34, 6, 9, 70821) Per capita = per head The bone powder used for cleansing sugar seems to be harmless.
('41', 34, 6, 10, 70906) Not a trace of it remains in the sugar.
('41', 34, 6, 11, 70946) It is thrown out with the impurities.
('41', 34, 6, 12, 70984) lt is not necessary to kill even a single cow for obtaining bones for this purpose.
('41', 34, 6, 13, 71068) This should be regarded as the same thing as the use of bones for fertilizers.
('41', 34, 6, 14, 71147) It is therefore wrong on our part to object to it on religious grounds.
('41', 34, 6, 15, 71219) Sugar worth Rs. 18 crore is imported into India.
('41', 34, 6, 16, 71268) The quantity would have perhaps increased now.
('41', 34, 6, 17, 71315) It is impossible to produce sugar worth Rs. 18 crore in India.
('41', 34, 6, 18, 71378) No one has ruined our sugar industry.
('41', 34, 6, 19, 71416) We use up all the sugarcane we produce.
('41', 34, 6, 20, 71456) The use of sugar has increased disproportionately in India as well as in the whole world.
('41', 34, 6, 21, 71546) 2 Whatever sugar we produce is like a drop in the ocean.
('41', 34, 6, 22, 71603) If you want to ask me more on the subject, please do.
('41', 34, 6, 23, 71657) Write to me if you know more.
('41', 34, 6, 24, 71687) I am sending the copy of the article on malaria to Navajivan.
('41', 34, 6, 25, 71749) There is some mistake in the copy.
('41', 34, 6, 26, 71784) I constantly think about why we have not been able to control malaria in the Ashram but am unable to find a solution.
('41', 34, 6, 27, 71902) I have talked to Kakasaheb.
('41', 34, 6, 28, 71930) He is carrying on correspondence on the subject with Dr. Talwalkar.

('41', 37, 5, 8, 75296) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 37, 5, 9, 75329) Of course if you wish to publish your book, there is no harm.
('41', 37, 5, 10, 75391) Perhaps my own experience is that it is better to wait for publishing such books till one has obtained greater and more accurate experience.
('41', 37, 5, 11, 75532) Your reference to different kinds of asanas 1 seem to me to have been taken from various books.
('41', 37, 5, 12, 75628) I have been in courrespondence with the writers of such books and I have found that whatever they have written is not capable of being borne out fully either by their own experience or the experience of others on whom one can rely.
('41', 37, 5, 13, 75860) But if you have confidence in what you have written, I have no desire to dissuade you from publishing the book.
('41', 37, 5, 14, 75972) If asana and pranayamas 2
('41', 37, 6, 15, 75998) are really efficacious as they are claimed to be, why dont you give them a thorough trial yourself?
('41', 37, 6, 16, 76098) I intended to do so myself but experts themselves dissuaded me owing to my illness.
('41', 37, 6, 17, 76182) I see no inconsistency between advocating brahmacharya and widow remarriage at the same time so long as I do not do so in connection with the same persons.
('41', 37, 6, 18, 76338) Whilst I would like all young men to be and remain brahmacharis, I did not hesitate to advocate, countenance and even officiate at marriages of those who find it impossible to practise self restraint.
('41', 37, 6, 19, 76539) Of course when I advocate the marriage of child widows, I presume that they want the pleasure which all animals seek and some human beings only can restrain themselves from seeking.

('41', 38, 1, 3, 76919) If the fallen sisters to whom you refer will not mind marrying a person belonging to any caste, there should be no difficulty and they ought not to object to any caste.
('41', 38, 1, 4, 77088) My asking them to obseve celibacy, if they cannot secure a proper match, has a meaning.
('41', 38, 1, 5, 77176) That is to say, if they will restrict themselves to a caste or a province, and yet lead a pure life, naturally they must observe celibacy or they must accept any person of any character.

('41', 38, 1, 10, 77603) In spite of your information, it would not be wrong to say that he was an embodiment of ahimsa.
('41', 38, 1, 11, 77699) He believed in that dharma and tried to follow it to the best of his lights.
('41', 38, 1, 12, 77776) That he did something which to us toda with our fuller epxerience appears to be repugnant to the doctrine of ahimsa, does not take away from the merit of Ramakrishna inasmuch as he could not think out of the custom pravalent around him, so far as food was concerned.
('41', 38, 1, 13, 78043) It is not 1 possible that future generations will condemn the eating of cooked food as contrary to ahimsa and yet the existing authorities of ahimsa will not be liable tocondemnation for not having discovered the inconsistency of eating cooked food.
('41', 38, 1, 14, 78293) No person is able to practise completest ahimsa.
('41', 38, 1, 15, 78342) Possession of a material frame involves a certain amount of unavoi dable himsa.
('41', 38, 1, 16, 78422) A votary of ahimsa therefore continually strives to reduce the extent of himsa to a minimum.
('41', 38, 1, 17, 78515) Please tell me if you want me to return the manuscript of your book.
('41', 38, 2, 18, 78584) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 39, 3, 4, 78833) MY DEAR OLIVE, I was delighted to hear from Miss Schlesin all about the family and your exploits.
('41', 39, 3, 5, 78931) Now I would like to shake hands with Clement who is now Dr. Clement and to hear you singing to me Lead Kindly Light.
('41', 39, 3, 6, 79048) You may not remember the scene, I do and I could paint it if I was a painter, so vivid is the recollection of that scene.
('41', 39, 4, 7, 79170) Your venturing out in the wilds of Africa does not appear at all strange to me, for, I should expect nothing less from Joseph Dokes children.
('41', 39, 4, 8, 79312) You must forgive this dictated letter.
('41', 39, 4, 9, 79351) I had to choose between postponing writing to you and dictating.
('41', 39, 4, 10, 79416) I have made a better choice.

('41', 39, 10, 17, 79648) SISTERS, God willing, there will be only one more Monday for me to write to you.
('41', 39, 10, 18, 79729) I have received Manibehns letter.
('41', 39, 10, 19, 79763) You suggest that I should discuss the question of dress in greater detail.
('41', 39, 10, 20, 79838) I shall not do so now, but you may reopen the point when we meet.
('41', 39, 10, 21, 79904) As long as we retain an attraction for fineries in the deepest recesses of our heart, it is useless

('41', 40, 1, 3, 80384) But if our infatuation for fineries passes off, and still the mind is drawn towards them, then we should make the necessary outward changes, whether through a sense of shame or by way of imitation of others, and ultimately root out this craving.
('41', 40, 1, 4, 80630) Infatuation and things like that are our enemies; they harass us so much that we should protect ourselves against them with help secured from every possible quarter.
('41', 40, 1, 5, 80796) I am writing all this for those who are honest and sincere.
('41', 40, 1, 6, 80856) The Gita says somewhere that those who deny themselves pleasures and crave for them in their hearts, are foolish and deceitful.
('41', 40, 1, 7, 80984) This refers to the hypocrite.
('41', 40, 1, 8, 81014) To those who are really honest and sincere, the Gita says that they should constantly control the passions that agitate them.

('41', 41, 3, 5, 81905) Though the doctors say that the blood pressure is high, I notice no effects of it.

('41', 42, 2, 7, 83334) I feel so helpless about many things and therefore leave them.

('41', 43, 2, 3, 84379) December 20, 1927 I The directors should be as vigilant and as jealous of the interests of their concern as the directors of the Bank of England, one of the greatest co operative corporations in the world.
('41', 43, 2, 4, 84585) But they have to be even more unselfish than they, inasmuch as the khadi company was not for exploitation, but for service of the poorest in the land.
('41', 43, 2, 5, 84736) Their ability lay in attention to the most minor details in mastering the science of spinning.
('41', 43, 2, 6, 84831) It is impossible for them to achieve any result unless they were expert spinners and expert organizers.
('41', 43, 2, 7, 84935) Some of the questions you have asked showed how unpractical you are.
('41', 43, 2, 8, 85004) Some of you want to know if I would have you put on loin cloth and to have a particular diet.
('41', 43, 2, 9, 85098) Well, I have no desire to regulate either your dress or diet.
('41', 43, 2, 10, 85160) What I want you to do is to realize the spirit of the movement and shape your life accordingly.
('41', 43, 2, 11, 85256) To you who want to serve Orissa I say, make Orissa a khadi depot for the whole of India.
('41', 43, 2, 12, 85345) And you cannot do so until all the spirit of rivalry goes out and all concentrate on production.
('41', 43, 2, 13, 85442) There can be no rivalry between khadi and khadi.
('41', 43, 2, 14, 85491) I can understand your objection to khadi from other provinces, but you should make no distinction between khadi produced in different parts of Orissa.
('41', 43, 2, 15, 85642) Concentrate on unifying your efforts and co ordinating your sales.
('41', 43, 2, 16, 85709) I heard the other day some young men talking of the development of agriculture.
('41', 43, 2, 17, 85789) If someone can prove to me that it is practicable and for the millions we have in view now, and can keep all the impoverished population from poverty and want, I will change my opinion about spinning.
('41', 43, 2, 18, 85990) But I warn you in the present conditions you will not be successful.
('41', 43, 2, 19, 86059) I have been working to build a model farm.
('41', 43, 2, 20, 86102) There are foolish friends to entrust me with money to indulge in experiment, and I squander money on them.
('41', 43, 2, 21, 86209) I had a talk with the late Sir Ganga Ram and supplied him with all the information about my lands, but he could not present me with a ready made workable plan
('41', 43, 3, 22, 86368) 1 These talks were delivered on 18th, 19th and 20th December, 1927. They are here reproduced under the date of the last talk.
('41', 43, 3, 23, 86494) Mahadev Desai says about these talks: Advice to those who wanted to run a khadi joint stock company was on the lines to the Rajapalayam merchants; vide Speech at Khadi Vastralaya, Rajapalayam, 4 10 1927.

('41', 44, 1, 2, 86739) to improve our agriculture.
('41', 44, 1, 3, 86767) I ask you to go to the villages and bury yourselves there, not as their masters or benefactors, but as their humble servants.
('41', 44, 1, 4, 86893) Let them know what to do and how to change their modes of living from your daily conduct and way of living.
('41', 44, 1, 5, 87001) Only feeling will be of no use just like steam which by itself is of no account unless it is kept under proper control when it becomes a mighty force.
('41', 44, 1, 6, 87152) I aks you to go forth as messengers of God carrying balm for the wounded soul of India.
('41', 44, 1, 7, 87240) II Do not be troubled by the question of the disposal of your production.
('41', 44, 1, 8, 87314) I could, if need be, disengage you from the obligation of selling.
('41', 44, 1, 9, 87381) Go on producing as much as you can.
('41', 44, 1, 10, 87417) There cannot be a better field for the production of khaddar than Orissa.
('41', 44, 1, 11, 87491) Only Orissa can make khaddar a proved proposition.
('41', 44, 1, 12, 87542) Intuitively of course it was a proved proposition to me in 1908, but you should demonstrate it practically.
('41', 44, 1, 13, 87650) Show to the world that you cannot exist without khadi.
('41', 44, 1, 14, 87705) Dont derive your faith from me, but derive it from yourselves and then refuse to be moved even if Gandhi changes his faith.
('41', 44, 1, 15, 87829) Show to the people that they must work if they want more food, and the work can be none else than you can give them and on your terms.
('41', 44, 1, 16, 87964) Remember that you cannot go on indefinitely relying merely on the patriotism of the people.
('41', 44, 1, 17, 88056) You must produce khadi which is in quality superior to any other cloth.
('41', 44, 1, 18, 88128) I ask you to remember that unless the people understand that khadi is their only salvation, unless they feel that they cannot be without khadi, you cannot succeed.
('41', 44, 1, 19, 88292) Mind you, I am not conducting this campaign to bring about a boycott of foreign cloth for its own sake.
('41', 44, 1, 20, 88396) It is a necessary condition of our living, and an incident of our producing our own cloth if we must live.
('41', 44, 1, 21, 88503) Go then to the villages and become villagers.
('41', 44, 1, 22, 88549) The story that the schoolmaster revealed at Charbatia was an eye opener.
('41', 44, 1, 23, 88622) It was a typical village.
('41', 44, 1, 24, 88648) What a field of operation he has!
('41', 44, 1, 25, 88682) You can take charge of the village school, make the children flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone and work amongst the villagers through the children.
('41', 44, 1, 26, 88838) You will enter into their sorrows, ask them why they send their men to those pestilential hovels in Calcutta instead of working for their bread in their own homes.
('41', 44, 1, 27, 89002) Go and get into their homes, handle their wheels, their carding bows, show them their defects, see how they live, teach them the elementary principles of sanitation.
('41', 44, 1, 28, 89168) It is this spinning of a constructive type that can bring swaraj and it is in this land that the charkha can sing its finest music.
('41', 44, 1, 29, 89300) Make every village self contained, make every home produce and use its own khadi, and as for the
('41', 45, 0, 1, 89397) 46 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 45, 1, 2, 89438) surplus khadi, take a written guarantee from me to sell it all if it is of standard quality.
('41', 45, 1, 3, 89531) Remember that only that worker will be worth his salt who makes the village he lives in self reliant.
('41', 45, 1, 4, 89633) The upshot of it all is the personal equation.
('41', 45, 1, 5, 89680) No learning is necessary, except learning in the school of love.
('41', 45, 1, 6, 89745) Have we workers honest, true, defiant, and burning with love of the country?
('41', 45, 1, 7, 89822) III One word, that I would like to leave with you, doubly afflicted people of this afflicted land, is that you will lose yourselves in the ocean of the submerged humanity about you.
('41', 45, 1, 8, 90004) Because it is submerged, the problem is simple.
('41', 45, 1, 9, 90052) The way is straight, even though it is narrow.
('41', 45, 1, 10, 90099) And you must treat it in the right and prayerful spirit.
('41', 45, 1, 11, 90156) We have been praying here for three days.
('41', 45, 1, 12, 90198) Prayer brings a peace, a strength and a consolation that nothing else can give.
('41', 45, 1, 13, 90278) But it must be offered from the heart.
('41', 45, 1, 14, 90317) When it is not offered from the heart, it is like the beating of a drum, or just the vocal effect of the throat sounds.
('41', 45, 1, 15, 90437) When it is offered from the heart, it has the power to melt mountains of misery.
('41', 45, 1, 16, 90518) Those who want are welcome to try its power.

('41', 45, 5, 21, 90927) Miss Schlesin has been of late writing to me regularly, and of course she is as mad and as good as ever.
('41', 45, 5, 22, 91032) Albert 3 never writes nowadays.
('41', 45, 5, 23, 91064) I did however get accounts of him and know that he and his are doing very well indeed.
('41', 45, 5, 24, 91151) Manilal and his wife have been writing to me regularly.

('41', 46, 6, 15, 92201) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 46, 6, 16, 92234) I can quite see that unless you have a living faith in God you cannot get rid of sinful thoughts much less sinful acts.
('41', 46, 6, 17, 92354) The only way I can commend to you to have that belief is to realize mans littleness and therefore your own and persist in believing.
('41', 46, 6, 18, 92487) 1 assuming that there must be a Being who is perfect and who is responsible for the wonderful phenomenon, the world.
('41', 46, 6, 19, 92604) I have no capacity to argue with you about the origin of evil.
('41', 46, 6, 20, 92667) It is enough for me humbly to recognize evil as evil and strive to combat it.
('41', 46, 6, 21, 92745) For, I know that God in Whom I believe helps me always in the combat.
('41', 46, 6, 22, 92815) Victory lies in striving.
('41', 46, 6, 23, 92841) To find honestly a guru and the striving necessitates the living of a pure life.

('41', 47, 3, 4, 93209) DEAR FRIEND, I am sorry I am able to reach your letter only today.
('41', 47, 3, 5, 93276) So far as my recollection serves me right, I have not given anyone any exclusive right to publish a translation of my Guide to Health 1 in Hindi or Urdu.
('41', 47, 3, 6, 93430) I am aware that many people have published translations of that book both in India and in Europe.
('41', 47, 3, 7, 93528) You should ask Messrs N. D. Saighal & Sons, Lahore, to show you my authority and if any such authority is produced to you, please send me a copy for my verification.

('41', 47, 6, 11, 93861) DEAR FRIEND, I am sorry I have not been able to reply to your letter earlier.
('41', 47, 6, 12, 93939) Your enquiry is quite pertinent.
('41', 47, 6, 13, 93972) The money that I collect or is sent to me for khadi must be spent on khadi, unless I may commit a breach of trust.
('41', 47, 6, 14, 94087) But I do collect and receive moneys for untouchables which are used only for their uplift.
('41', 47, 6, 15, 94178) I collect moneys in this manner for activities which are controlled by me directly or indirectly.

('41', 48, 3, 5, 94744) I cannot help feeling that your judgement is warped according to your reasoning that there should be no effort on the part of mankind for self improvement.
('41', 48, 3, 6, 94900) A prisoner who is innocently convicted you would say should not try to secure his release.

('41', 49, 3, 4, 95822) DEAR FRIEND, I have not been able to deal with your letter earlier.
('41', 49, 3, 5, 95890) I do not think you need a scheme so much as proper workers, and since you have Miss Gmeiner and Babu Jugal Kishore, I think you cannot do better than be guided by them.
('41', 49, 3, 6, 96059) One mistake I would ask you to guard yourself against, namely, making the Widows Home a mere literary school where widows will have everything done for them.
('41', 49, 3, 7, 96217) I should give the widows some industrial training and make them self reliant and ultimately self supporting.
('41', 49, 3, 8, 96326) I shall also guard against making them sectional.

('41', 49, 6, 12, 96468) 60. OUR SHAME AND THEIR SHAME
('41', 49, 7, 13, 96498) The long deferred Orissa visit has come to fill the bitter cup of sorrow and humiliation.
('41', 49, 7, 14, 96588) It was at Bolgarh, thirty one miles from the nearest railway station, that whilst I was sitting and talking with Dinabandhu Andrews on the 11th instant, a man with a half bent back wearing only a dirty loin cloth came crouching in front of us.
('41', 49, 7, 15, 96832) He picked up a straw and put it in his mouth and then lay flat on his face with arms outstretched and then raised himself, folded his hands, bowed, took out the straw, arranged it in his hair and was about to leave.
('41', 49, 7, 16, 97048) I was writhing in agony whilst I witnessed the scene.
('41', 49, 7, 17, 97102) Immediately the performance was finished, I shouted for an interpreter, asked the friend to come near and began to talk to him.
('41', 49, 7, 18, 97230) He was an untouchable living in a village six miles away, and being in Bolgarh for the sale of his load of faggots and having heard of me had come to see me.
('41', 49, 7, 19, 97388) Asked why he should have taken the straw in his

('41', 50, 1, 2, 97510) mouth, he said that was to honour me.
('41', 50, 1, 3, 97548) I hung my head in shame.
('41', 50, 1, 4, 97573) The price of honour seemed to me to be too great to bear.
('41', 50, 1, 5, 97631) My Hindu spirit was deeply wounded.
('41', 50, 1, 6, 97667) I asked him for a gift.
('41', 50, 1, 7, 97691) He searched for a copper about his waist.
('41', 50, 1, 8, 97733) I do not want your copper, but I want you to give me something better, I said.
('41', 50, 1, 9, 97812) I will give it, he replied.
('41', 50, 1, 10, 97840) I had ascertained from him that he drank and ate carrion because it was custom.
('41', 50, 1, 11, 97920) The gift I want you to give me is a promise never again to take the straw in your mouth for any person on earth, it is beneath mans dignity to do so; never again to drink because it reduces man to the condition of a beast, and never again to eat carrion, for it is against Hinduism and no civilized person would ever eat carrion. But my people will excommunicate me, if I do not drink and eat carrion, the poor man said.
('41', 50, 1, 12, 98341) Then suffer excommunication and if need be leave the village. This downtrodden humble man made the promise.
('41', 50, 1, 13, 98449) If he keeps, it, his threefold gift is more precious than the rupees that generous countrymen entrust to my care.
('41', 50, 1, 14, 98563) This untouchability is our greatest shame.
('41', 50, 1, 15, 98606) The humiliation of it is sinking deeper.
('41', 50, 2, 16, 98647) But this never to be forgotten incident was only part of the shame and sorrow.
('41', 50, 2, 17, 98726) Never since the days of Champaran (in 1917) 1
('41', 50, 3, 18, 98772) have I witnessed such death like quiet as I did on entering political Orissa through Banpur.
('41', 50, 3, 19, 98865) And I fear that the quiet of Orissa is worse than that of Champaran.
('41', 50, 3, 20, 98934) There was spirit in the ryots of Champaran after a few days stay in their midst.
('41', 50, 3, 21, 99015) I doubt if the Orissa ryot would respond so quickly.
('41', 50, 3, 22, 99068) I was told that the zamindars, the rajas and the local police had conspired to frighten the ryots out of coming near me.
('41', 50, 3, 23, 99189) I had begun to flatter myself with the belief that the rajas, the zamindars and the pettiest police officials had ceased to distrust or fear me.
('41', 50, 3, 24, 99334) The experiences of Orissa have chastened me.
('41', 50, 3, 25, 99379) Being too weak to go about much, I sent my friends among the people and ascertained the cause.
('41', 50, 3, 26, 99474) They brought the news that people were told, on pain of punishment, not to come near me or to take part in any demonstration in my honour.
('41', 50, 3, 27, 99613) Such warnings have been issued before and in other provinces, but they have had little or no effect in normal

('41', 51, 0, 1, 99746) 52 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 51, 1, 2, 99787) times such as these.
('41', 51, 1, 3, 99808) The ryots in Orissa, however, seemed to me to be living in a perpetual state of fear and liable to be acted upon by the slightest attempt.
('41', 51, 1, 4, 99947) This is a shame both we and the foreign rulers have to share.
('41', 51, 1, 5, 100009) It is true that the rajas and zamindars and the petty officials are our own kith and kin.
('41', 51, 1, 6, 100099) But the primary source of fright is in the rulers.
('41', 51, 1, 7, 100150) Their system is based on frightfulness.
('41', 51, 1, 8, 100190) In the name of prestige they have compelled somehow or other the tallest among us to bend low.
('41', 51, 1, 9, 100285) They have intensified, where they have not created, demoralization.
('41', 51, 1, 10, 100353) They have known the existence of abject fear among the ryots.
('41', 51, 1, 11, 100415) But they have done nothing to remove it and the causes, where they have not hugged the condition of things in the alleged interest of their rule.
('41', 51, 1, 12, 100561) Whilst therefore they may not be directly responsible for the pathetic scenes I witnessed, they cannot be acquitted of a considerable share of responsibility for them.
('41', 51, 1, 13, 100729) But our shame is greater.
('41', 51, 1, 14, 100755) If we were strong, self respecting and not susceptible to frightulness, the foreign rulers would have been powerless for mischief.
('41', 51, 1, 15, 100886) Those only who are susceptible to fear are frightened by others.
('41', 51, 1, 16, 100951) And it has to be confessed that long before the British advent we were habituated to fear by our own zamindars and rajas.
('41', 51, 1, 17, 101073) The present rulers have but reduced to a science what was in existence before in a more or less crude share.
('41', 51, 1, 18, 101182) The workers in Orissa have therefore to teach the ryot to shed the oppressive nervous timidity bordering on cowardice.
('41', 51, 1, 19, 101301) And this they will not do by swearing at the zamindar.
('41', 51, 1, 20, 101356) the raja or the police officials.
('41', 51, 1, 21, 101390) These latter become docile and even friendly when they find that the ryot has unlearned the unmanly habit.

('41', 51, 3, 24, 101543) A friend sends me for publication a charkha dialogue.
('41', 51, 3, 25, 101597) I am not printing it as I have discovered no plot about the story, but I gladly publish the following instructive verses the writer has quoted and put into the mouth of a little girl telling her little brother that they should begin to work the charkha for the sake of the poor even though they were youngsters :
('41', 51, 4, 26, 101910) Suppose the little cowslip Should hang its golden cup, And say, Im such a tiny flower,

('41', 52, 1, 2, 102038) Id better not grow up : How many a weary traveller Would miss its fragrant smell?
('41', 52, 1, 3, 102120) How many a little child would grieve To lose it from the dell ?
('41', 52, 2, 4, 102184) Suppose the glistening dewdrop Upon the grass should say, What can a little dewdrop do?
('41', 52, 2, 5, 102272) Id better roll away : The blade on which it rested, Before the day was done, Without a drop to moisten it, Would wither in the sun.
('41', 52, 3, 6, 102404) Suppose the little breezes, Upon a summers day, Should think themselves too small to cool The traveller on his way : Who would not miss the smallest And softest ones that blow, And think they made a great mistake If they were talking so?
('41', 52, 4, 7, 102642) How many deed of kindness A little child may do; Although it has so little strength And little wisdom too.
('41', 52, 4, 8, 102749) It wants a loving spirit, Much more than strength, to prove How many things a child may do For others by his love.
('41', 52, 4, 9, 102864) These beautiful verses apply equally to many of us grown up people who talk no better than the little children in the imaginary story.
('41', 52, 4, 10, 102999) We may not excuse ourselves from sacrificial spinning on the flimsy excuse that it is too little to be of use.
('41', 52, 4, 11, 103110) Not for us thus to argue ourselves into laziness; ours is but to do our little best and leave to God to use it as He wills.

('41', 53, 2, 3, 103327) December [22] 1, 1927
('41', 53, 3, 4, 103349) RAMDAS, I have your letter.
('41', 53, 3, 5, 103377) You are needlessly worried.
('41', 53, 3, 6, 103405) I am hopeful that health will be restored.
('41', 53, 3, 7, 103448) But if it does not happen and I remain bed ridden then....
('41', 53, 3, 8, 103507) I began this letter four days ago.
('41', 53, 3, 9, 103542) Just then the doctor 2 arrived and it was left there.
('41', 53, 3, 10, 103596) I now take it up in Madras where I arrived today.
('41', 53, 3, 11, 103646) We shall see about that.
('41', 53, 3, 12, 103671) For the present let us resolve that on the Vasant Panchami 3 day you will be entering a new life and shouldering a new responsibility in the name of God and with His help.
('41', 53, 4, 13, 103843) Apparently there is nothing wrong with my health.
('41', 53, 4, 14, 103893) But the blood pressure is very high.
('41', 53, 4, 15, 103930) There is no doubt of that.
('41', 53, 4, 16, 103957) All I need is rest.
('41', 53, 4, 17, 103977) It is not also true that I do not observe the rules about health which I prescribe for others.
('41', 53, 4, 18, 104072) But I shall explain this to you one day if you ask me.
('41', 53, 4, 19, 104127) Today I wish to write about one point in your previous letter.
('41', 53, 4, 20, 104190) Why should Nimu not do independent work?
('41', 53, 4, 21, 104231) You know that millions of our poor people work like that.
('41', 53, 4, 22, 104289) We have become sweepers and scavengers!
('41', 53, 4, 23, 104329) What about Ramjibhai and Gangabehn?
('41', 53, 4, 24, 104365) In countless peasant families both husbands and wives earn.
('41', 53, 4, 25, 104425) In factories both men and women work.
('41', 53, 4, 26, 104463) Here both Anna and his wife Gomatibehn take salaries and also do the Hindi work.
('41', 53, 4, 27, 104544) By following this practice your family life will become not difficult but smooth and you will become an ideal couple.
('41', 53, 4, 28, 104662) Thousands of people have children while they work.
('41', 53, 4, 29, 104713) Yes, it is true.
('41', 53, 4, 30, 104730) that they are not able to live in comfort.
('41', 53, 4, 31, 104773) But you must ask me for further clarification on this point.
('41', 53, 4, 32, 104834) I wish you to have a happy, simple, useful and interesting life.
('41', 53, 4, 33, 104899) The circumstances are also favourable.
('41', 53, 4, 34, 104938) Everything depends on your education and Nimus.
('41', 53, 4, 35, 104986) I wanted to train her but could not manage it.
('41', 53, 4, 36, 105033) There were obstacles in the way.
('41', 53, 4, 37, 105066) I fell ill and on returning to the Ashram could not cope with three obstacles at the same time.
('41', 53, 4, 38, 105162) But Nimu is herself a good girl and hence I am not worried.
('41', 53, 4, 39, 105222) The only question is how far your body will co operate.
('41', 53, 4, 40, 105278) I shall not write anything more now.

('41', 54, 5, 10, 105968) The best way to study the Gita apart from recitation is to take it verse by verse, understand its meaning fully and apply it in the working of ones own life.

('41', 54, 9, 16, 106503) I have the information from the Ashram that your drama has been received.

('41', 55, 7, 9, 107327) MY DEAR FRIEND, I was delighted to hear from you the wedding for which you had to go away from me at Colombo had been duly celebrated.
('41', 55, 7, 10, 107462) Please convey to the married couple my good wishes again and tell them that I expect them both to work for the service of the country.
('41', 55, 7, 11, 107597) Yes, the contributions from Ceylon were exceedingly good.
('41', 55, 7, 12, 107655) I do not need to commend any particular thing to you, for I know that your whole heart is in khadi service which is the most universal and practical service of the country at the present moment.

('41', 56, 2, 3, 108150) MY DEAR FRIEND, I like your letter.
('41', 56, 2, 4, 108186) 1 What you say about the girls and women of India is largely true.
('41', 56, 2, 5, 108253) But you and other girls in your position can do a great deal in deal in order to remove the bondage.
('41', 56, 2, 6, 108354) If you are firm in your resolve and at the same time gentle, I am sure that your father will let you follow your own bent of mind.
('41', 56, 2, 7, 108485) But in order to achieve the result, you must be patient.
('41', 56, 2, 8, 108542) Live there the life of simplicity that you have pictured to yourself in the Ashram at Sabarmati.
('41', 56, 2, 9, 108639) After all mind is the greatest factor.
('41', 56, 2, 10, 108678) And if your mind is married to the idea of simplicity and purity no power on earth can divorce it from their idea.
('41', 56, 2, 11, 108793) I note what you say about your idea of necessaries of life.
('41', 56, 2, 12, 108853) Do you want me to speak to your father and even correspond with him?
('41', 56, 2, 13, 108922) You should not be afraid to talk to your father freely and give him your full confidence.

('41', 57, 6, 10, 110056) I do not think it is necessary to publish it in Young India.
('41', 57, 6, 11, 110117) I therefore return it.
('41', 57, 6, 12, 110140) In my opinion, khadi will not become popular by publishing general state ments of the kind you have prepared.
('41', 57, 6, 13, 110250) It requires organization and personal propaganda both of which are being attended to as far as is possible.

('41', 59, 10, 15, 112777) December 23, 1927
('41', 59, 11, 16, 112795) Mahatmaji, before declaring the Exhibition open, made a speech in English which was translated into Tamil by Mr. C. Rajagopalachari.
('41', 59, 11, 17, 112928) He said that it was a great privilege to be called upon to open the exhibitions.
('41', 59, 11, 18, 113009) He was not physically fit to raise his voice to such a pitch as to be heard by all.
('41', 59, 11, 19, 113093) He was not going to make a long speech and he was not able, in his present state of health, to address such a large
('41', 59, 12, 20, 113209) 1 From V. K. Sankara Menon, Manager, Pulaya Colony, Chalakudi, a colony run by the Depressed Classes Development Society.
('41', 59, 12, 21, 113331) He had invited Gandhijis suggestions and advice.
('41', 60, 0, 1, 113380) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 61
('41', 60, 1, 2, 113421) audience.
('41', 60, 1, 3, 113431) He need not dwell long on the necessity for khaddar for he was just returning from Utkal where he had seen with his own eyes emachiated men and women on account of starvation.
('41', 60, 1, 4, 113607) To such people khaddar would do an immense good.
('41', 60, 1, 5, 113656) If the people present at the meeting has seen those famished people of Utkal they would readily agree with him that khadi was the only thing that could save them from such a low condition.
('41', 60, 1, 6, 113845) Khadi was a movement in which Tamils and Telugus, and people of the north and south of India could take part without any distinction of caste or creed.
('41', 60, 1, 7, 113997) A visit to Utkal would make them instinctively support the khadi movement.
('41', 60, 1, 8, 114072) The khadi exhibition by the side of the industrial exhibition looked like an ant before an elephant.
('41', 60, 1, 9, 114173) In the bigger exhibition there were both foreign and indigenous articles.
('41', 60, 1, 10, 114247) In the khadi exhibition they would find only indigenous goods, hand spun and hand woven and there was no competition here, the only competition being how shall I serve, how shall I serve best.
('41', 60, 1, 11, 114440) In the khadi exhibition they would find goods manufactured by poor men and women and those goods must have given food to a number of poor people.
('41', 60, 1, 12, 114586) Manchester goods and Indian mill made goods went to enrich English and Indian capitalists, whereas khaddar provided food for the poorest labourers who had no other means of living.
('41', 60, 1, 13, 114767) The khadi movement had given food to seventy five thousand spinners scattered in 2,000 villages and also six thousand weavers lived by weaving khaddar cloth.
('41', 60, 1, 14, 114925) He had mentioned only spinners and weavers in connection with the movement and had not taken into consideration others engaged in printing, dyeing, etc., who were benefited by it.
('41', 60, 1, 15, 115105) In addition to these poor people about one thousand young men belonging to middle class had also taken up the khadi work.
('41', 60, 1, 16, 115227) Khadi would also give employment to the unemployed and solve the problem of unemployment among the middle classes which was agitating the minds of many.
('41', 60, 1, 17, 115380) Khadi would give work to the people of IndiaBrahmins and Non Brahmins, Hindus and Mussalmans and the so called untouchables.
('41', 60, 1, 18, 115505) Very soon they would go round the stalls to see the exhibits for themselves.
('41', 60, 1, 19, 115582) When they did so, he would ask them to go round the exhibition with a feeling of sympathy for the poor and to consider what amount of energy and time must have been spent upon those products by the poor people to earn something to keep body and soul together.
('41', 60, 1, 20, 115842) They would also find that the cost of the khaddar products was much reduced.
('41', 60, 2, 21, 115919) Next to the khadi exhibition, they would find the Hindi exhibition.
('41', 60, 2, 22, 115987) The Hindi movement was conceived in the interests of millions of Indians.
('41', 60, 2, 23, 116061) Hindi or Hindustani was spoken by 21 crores of people and it was the mother tongue of many Mussalmans.
('41', 60, 2, 24, 116164) It was the only language which could be inter provincial.
('41', 60, 2, 25, 116222) For some time past attempts had been made to propagate Hindi in South India.
('41', 60, 2, 26, 116299) The Hindi Prachar Sabha had been instituted and had been giving instruction in Hindi to a large number of people in the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Desha.
('41', 60, 2, 27, 116448) Many people in those two provinces had learnt Hindi and passed examinations.
('41', 60, 2, 28, 116525) The Hindi exhibitions was to have been opened by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya but, he having not arrived, he (Mahatmaji)
('41', 61, 0, 1, 116645) 62 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 61, 1, 2, 116686) had been asked to open the exhibition.
('41', 61, 1, 3, 116725) He would ask them to learn Hindi and would inform them that it could be learnt easily.
('41', 61, 1, 4, 116812) After learning it, they would find it a beautiful language.
('41', 61, 2, 5, 116872) With these words he declared the khadi and Hindi exhibitions open.

('41', 61, 7, 14, 117238) 75. THE INDRARAJ SPINNING WHEEL
('41', 61, 8, 15, 117270) In the issue of the Khadipatrika dated 1 12 27 Shri Harjivandas Kotak has written an article on the place that khadi occupies in Kashmir.
('41', 61, 8, 16, 117408) I would recommend the article to all lovers of khadi.
('41', 61, 8, 17, 117462) Its merit lies in Shri Harjivandass personal experience.
('41', 61, 8, 18, 117519) He has written the article after having observed things for himself during his stay in Kashmir.
('41', 61, 8, 19, 117615) Three facts become clear from this.
('41', 61, 8, 20, 117651) (1) The importance of the spinning wheel, (2) The place it still occupies in Kashmir, (3) The ruin of this invaluable industry in Kashmir.
('41', 61, 8, 21, 117790) We can get proofs of the value of the spinning wheel in the south in Nagercoil right up to Kanyakumari.
('41', 61, 8, 22, 117894) We get these right up to Assam in the east and we have now found them as far north as Kashmir.
('41', 61, 8, 23, 117989) In the west, we find them right up to Kathiawar.
('41', 61, 8, 24, 118038) I do not mention Karachi in the west because Karachi is a new city and, it is natural that people there being enamoured of wealth do not realize the value of the spinning wheelalthough even there, because of the efforts of such lovers of khadi as the late Shri Ranchhoddas even up to this day, propaganda for the spinning wheel is being carried on in a
('41', 61, 9, 25, 118391) 1 This note follows M. K. Pandyas article complaining that untouchables were forbidden to enter the temple of Ranchhodaraiji at Dakor and to bathe in the Gomati tank near the temple.

('41', 62, 1, 2, 118641) new manner and khadi is being used.
('41', 62, 1, 3, 118677) Shri Harjivandass article reveals that the silk produced there (in Kashmir) is not hand spun.
('41', 62, 1, 4, 118771) Until this day some of us who are fond of good clothes wore Kashmiri silk under the impression that it was hand spun; however, it is clear that those who wish to use clothes of only hand spun cotton, silk or wool must give up the use of Kashmiri silk.
('41', 62, 1, 5, 119023) One should spin oneself as much as is necessary to prepare what one wishes to wear of the finest stuff; one should get cloth of medium quality spun at the nearest possible place, while inferior cloth could be bought from whatever in an honest dealer sells under the name of hand woven fabric.
('41', 62, 1, 6, 119316) [From Gujarati] Navajivan, 25 12 1927
('41', 62, 2, 7, 119354) 76. WHAT SHOULD A HINDU WIDOW DO ?
('41', 62, 2, 8, 119389) A gentleman from Ajmer writes in Hindi to say : I wish you to answer the following questions of mine, in Navajivan : How should Hindu widows not wishing to remarry spend the rest of their lives?
('41', 62, 2, 9, 119584) Maharshi Dayanand has written to say that they should practise celibacy, educate themselves and also educate young girls.
('41', 62, 2, 10, 119706) Do you agree with this view?
('41', 62, 2, 11, 119735) If so, keeping in mind the present plight of our country, what would you like to add to this?
('41', 62, 2, 12, 119829) Maharshi Dayanand did not hold that all widows should spend their time in learning and teaching; this could only be by way of an example.
('41', 62, 2, 13, 119967) In this case teaching means imparting a knowledge of letters.
('41', 62, 2, 14, 120029) This knowledge is necessary to some extent; in my opinion, however, the more important teaching is how to stave off starvation.
('41', 62, 2, 15, 120157) And every day, I am more firmly convinced that this lies in the spinning wheel.
('41', 62, 2, 16, 120237) If we of the middle class who are educated, and who look upon ourselves as belonging to the higher castes give a thought to the condition of the poorer classes, nothing else but the spinning wheel will occur to us.
('41', 62, 2, 17, 120452) The spinning wheel will be plied mainly by women as it is primarily they who have time to spare.
('41', 62, 2, 18, 120549) Hence I have been crying from the house tops at various places, day and night, that
('41', 63, 0, 1, 120633) 64 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 63, 1, 2, 120674) it is through them that we would prevent crores of rupees from being drained out of the country and secure true swarajRamarajya 1. It is women who can readily approach others of their sex.
('41', 63, 1, 3, 120863) Here in the Province of Orissa where I happen to write this, and where even the poorer women observe purdah, who can set aside purdah and approach them?
('41', 63, 1, 4, 121016) I sent Mirabehn who has accompanied me to the women of a certain village.
('41', 63, 1, 5, 121090) About fifty women surrounded her and became crazy with joy they started asking her about many things and the spinning wheel came up for discussion.
('41', 63, 1, 6, 121238) These women were absolutely naive, simple and ignorant.
('41', 63, 1, 7, 121294) It is innumerable women of this type who should really be educated.
('41', 63, 1, 8, 121362) Widows with pure character can readily impart such education, serve their own interest and, at the same time, help India solve its problems.
('41', 63, 1, 9, 121503) Widows who are benevo lently inclined can easily learn this work and do justice to it.
('41', 63, 1, 10, 121590) However, an important prior condition for this is that they should be keen on going to villages and, while living there, should not get impatient.
('41', 63, 1, 11, 121737) A widow who takes the vow of celibacy is not a helpless, crippled individual.
('41', 63, 1, 12, 121815) If she is fit for self realization, she is a strong independent woman capable of protecting herself.
('41', 63, 1, 13, 121916) Compared with this, the education given to girls today is, I thing, of little consequence.
('41', 63, 1, 14, 122007) If however a widow refuses to go to the villages, idles away her time or, year after year, runs from one place of supposed pilgrimage to another, mistaking this for dharma, it is obviously better if she stayed even in the city and engaged herself in teaching children.
('41', 63, 1, 15, 122276) She has before her the vast field of nursing the sick.
('41', 63, 1, 16, 122331) Very few Hindu women take up the profession of nursing.
('41', 63, 1, 17, 122387) Widows in Maharashtra are found undergoing this training.
('41', 63, 1, 18, 122445) Outside Maharashtra, very few widows are prepared to undergo this training.
('41', 63, 1, 19, 122521) However, the jobs that I have suggested should also be regarded only as examples.
('41', 63, 1, 20, 122603) Every sensible widow who wishes to practise celibacy should seek out some useful activity for herself and devote her whole life to it.

('41', 64, 2, 4, 122943) DEAR DR.
('41', 64, 2, 5, 122952) ANSARI, I had a long chat with Malaviyaji.
('41', 64, 2, 6, 122995) The resolution on the cow and the music as it stands does not satisfy him, nor does it satisfy me.
('41', 64, 2, 7, 123094) I have suggested two formulas to which he agrees and thinks the Hindu Mahasabha will agree.
('41', 64, 2, 8, 123186) The first is this: the preamble instead of mentioning rights should say without prejudice to the rights of either party, etc. 1 The second which I consider to be the most important and the true solution is that Mussalmans should forgo cow slaughter and the Hindus should forgo music before mosques.
('41', 64, 2, 9, 123485) They should be part of legislation by common consent.
('41', 64, 2, 10, 123539) Malaviyaji thinks that if the second proposal can be accepted by the Mussalmans, he will be able to carry the Hindu Sahba with him.
('41', 64, 2, 11, 123671) If you think that there is anything in the two proposals please postpone passing the unity resolutions and let us discuss the proposals in all their bearings.

('41', 64, 5, 15, 123972) The Orissa resolution should not be in the Congress.
('41', 64, 5, 16, 124025) Because there are so many places that have suffered.
('41', 64, 5, 17, 124078) The special poverty of Orissa is chronic.

('41', 64, 5, 19, 124182) I have not attended any sittings of the Congress Committee.

('41', 66, 4, 12, 126620) [December 27, 1927] 1
('41', 66, 5, 13, 126642) This Congress, while acknowledging the relief received by the Indian settlers in South Africa and regarding the signing of the Indo Union Agreement as a token of the desire of the Union Government to Accord better treatment to the Indian settlers, cannot be satisfied till the status of the settlers is brought on par with that of the enfranchised inhabitants of the Union and appeals to the Union Government to consolidate the goodwill created between the two countries by repealing all class legislation, especially the Colour Bar Act of 1926, the clause in the Liquor Bill of 1927 prohibiting the employment of Indians as waiters in hotels and the Municipal Land Alienation Ordinances or Natal in so far as the latter involve racial segregation.
('41', 66, 5, 14, 127391) This Congress places on record its sense of deep gratitude to Deenabandhu C.F. Andrews for his great and humanitarian work in South Africa and East Africa in connection with the status of the Indian settlers in those countries.

('41', 67, 2, 5, 127993) ANSARI, The Cow Resolution has shaken me to the marrow.
('41', 67, 2, 6, 128049) I could read it carefully only last night.
('41', 67, 2, 7, 128092) The more I think of it, the more I shrink from it.
('41', 67, 2, 8, 128143) The draft 1 I sent with M. A. Azad is no substitute.
('41', 67, 2, 9, 128196) I have told the Maulana Saheb that it does not in any way satisfy me.
('41', 67, 2, 10, 128266) The only solution that I can see is the one I have suggested.
('41', 67, 2, 11, 128328) I would therefore urge you not to proceed with that resolution at all during this session.
('41', 67, 2, 12, 128419) I must have a chat with the Mussalman friends who are here and whom I know, and place before them my awful position.
('41', 67, 2, 13, 128536) But I wont trouble you at this stage.
('41', 67, 2, 14, 128574) You have so many things on your hands.

('41', 68, 1, 2, 129410) 85. POLITICAL PRISONERS
('41', 68, 2, 3, 129434) Lala Dunichand of Ambala has sent me a copy of the statement published by him in England about political prisoners who are undergoing incarceration in the various jails of India.
('41', 68, 2, 4, 129613) The statement contains nothing new for the Indian public and might easily have been fuller and more precise for the purpose intended by the author.
('41', 68, 2, 5, 129761) In a convering note he administers to me a gentle rebuke for rarely mentioning these prisoners.
('41', 68, 2, 6, 129857) If the absence of mention of these countrymen of ours means apathy or negligence on my part, the rebuke is well deserved.
('41', 68, 2, 7, 129979) But I claim that I yield to no one in my desire to see these prisoners released.
('41', 68, 2, 8, 130060) But the omission to mention these cases is deliberate.
('41', 68, 2, 9, 130115) I hope that the pages of Young India do not contain any idle words.
('41', 68, 2, 10, 130183) Whatever is written in these pages has a definite purpose.
('41', 68, 2, 11, 130242) Time was when I used to analyse these cases and expose the injustice done in many of them.
('41', 68, 2, 12, 130333) But that was when I had faith in the British system and when I used to take pride in its ultimate goodness.
('41', 68, 2, 13, 130441) Having lost that faith, I have lost also the power of making an effective appeal to the administrators of that system.
('41', 68, 2, 14, 130560) I can no longer write about British fair play and the British sense of justice.
('41', 68, 2, 15, 130640) On the contrary, I feel that the administrators are precluded by their system from dealing out fair play or justice when their system is or seems to them to be in jeopardy.
('41', 68, 2, 16, 130813) It is still possible, I admit, to secure justice from them when their system is not at stake in any shape or form.
('41', 68, 2, 17, 130928) But when that system is or is felt by them to be in danger they lose not only their sense of justice and fair play but they lose their balance and no means appear to them to be too dishonourable or despicable for adoption to sustain it.
('41', 68, 2, 18, 131165) Dyerism and ODwyerism 1 were no isolated phenomena.
('41', 68, 2, 19, 131217) Only I was blind to them before Jallianwala.
('41', 68, 2, 20, 131262) As a matter of fact, they have been resorted to in all climes and at all times whenever they have felt the need of them.
('41', 68, 2, 21, 131383) I am satisfied that the political prisoners who are held under restraint with or without trial, decorous or farcical, are so held in the interest of that system.
('41', 68, 2, 22, 131545) The administrators would far rather discharge a murderer caught red handed and found guilty of murder committed for private ends than discharge a political prisoner suspected of designs on their system, especially if he, the suspect, is believed to
('41', 68, 3, 23, 131794) 1 General Dyer and ODwyer were responsible for the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh in April 1919.
('41', 69, 0, 1, 131889) 70 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 69, 1, 2, 131930) have violent means in view.
('41', 69, 1, 3, 131958) It seems to me therefore to be waste of time and inconsistent with respect to make any appeal to the administrators in behalf of the political prisoners Lala Dunichand has in view.
('41', 69, 1, 4, 132139) And he has in mind the prisoners of the Gadr party, the Punjab Martial Law prisoners and the Bengal detenus.
('41', 69, 1, 5, 132248) Nor need we be led astray by solitary discharges like that of Sjt.
('41', 69, 1, 6, 132315) Subhas Bose.
('41', 69, 1, 7, 132328) In spite of the agitation that was set on foot he would in all probability not have been discharged if his precarious health had not come to the rescue.
('41', 69, 1, 8, 132481) Indeed, have they not said in the plainest language possible that they were released purely on grounds of ill health?
('41', 69, 1, 9, 132599) Has not Earl Winterton 1 flatly declined to release the Bengal detenus in answer to the appeal to create a favourable atmosphere for their precious Statutory Commission?
('41', 69, 1, 10, 132769) Let those who still have faith in the system by all means make an appeal to the British sense of justice and fair play.
('41', 69, 1, 11, 132889) My course is clear.
('41', 69, 1, 12, 132909) We have not yet paid anything like adequate price for the freedom we would fain breathe.
('41', 69, 1, 13, 132998) I therefore regard these imprisonments as only a small part of the price we have to pay if we would have the freedom which is the birthright of man.
('41', 69, 1, 14, 133147) And we shall have to march as willing victims to the slaughter house and not helplessly like goats and sheep.
('41', 69, 1, 15, 133257) We may do this violently or non violently.
('41', 69, 1, 16, 133300) The way of violence can only lead us to a blind alley and must cause endless suffering to unwilling ignorant men and women who do not know what freedom is and who have no desire to buy the valuable article.
('41', 69, 1, 17, 133507) The way of non violence is the surest and the quickest way to freedom and causes the least suffering and that only to those who are prepared for it, indeed would gladly court it.
('41', 69, 1, 18, 133686) But suffering, intense, extensive and agonizing, there must be in every case.
('41', 69, 1, 19, 133764) What we have gone through is but a sample of what is to come.
('41', 69, 1, 20, 133826) Therefore the task before those, who share my views about the inherent evil of the system, is to cease to appeal to the administrators, and ceaselessly and with unquenchable faith in our cause and the means to appeal to the nation.
('41', 69, 1, 21, 134058) Not until the nation has developed enough strength to open the prison gates, can these prisoners be released with honour and dignity for it and them.
('41', 69, 1, 22, 134208) Till then let us with becoming patience and courage submit to the imprisonment of the prisoners and ourselves prepare joyfully to share their fate.
('41', 69, 1, 23, 134356) We shall certainly not hasten the advent of freedom by appealing to deaf ears

('41', 70, 3, 6, 134793) In reply to a question by the interviewer as to which of the three draft constitutions 1 drawn up by the Madras leaders he considered best suited to India, Mr. Gandhi said that he had no decisive opinion about the future Constitution of India.
('41', 70, 3, 7, 135037) He, however, added : The Constitution of India is not a matter for a single individual to decide.
('41', 70, 4, 8, 135135) Seated in the midst of his friends and disciples, playing the inseparable charkha, Mr. Gandhi politely invited our representative to put questions to him.
('41', 70, 4, 9, 135290) What are your impressions of the Madras Session of the Congress?, was the first question by the interviewer.
('41', 70, 5, 10, 135399) ANSWER: The Madras Session was a unique one inasmuch as it seems to have laid the foundation of Hindu Muslim unity.
('41', 70, 5, 11, 135515) This, I say, not because of the quality of the resolutions, but because of the manner in which they were presented and accepted.
('41', 70, 5, 12, 135644) Pandit Malaviyajis happy speech and the still happier response made by Ali Brothers appeared to me to be a good augury for future.
('41', 70, 5, 13, 135775) I was not present when the scene of Maulana Mahomed Ali in ecstacy falling at Malaviyajis feet and Maulana Shaukat Ali fanning him after he had finished his great speech took place; but it was described to me by the President of the Congress.
('41', 70, 5, 14, 136018) It filled me with great joy and hope.
('41', 70, 5, 15, 136056) I hope this spirit of cordiality and mutual trust will prove infectious and we shall be able to find such trust amongst the rank and file.
('41', 70, 5, 16, 136195) Both Dr. Ansari and Mr. S. Aiyengar deserve the gratitude of the nation for this happy event.
('41', 70, 6, 17, 136289) Asked why he was not present when the Independence Resolution 2 was
('41', 70, 7, 18, 136357) 1 Submitted before the Madras Session of the Congress; the Working Committee was given power to confer with other bodies and place a revised draft before a Special Convention for approval.
('41', 70, 7, 19, 136546) 2 In a separate resolution, the Congress declared the goal of the Indian people to be complete National Independence.
('41', 71, 0, 1, 136664) 72 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 71, 1, 2, 136705) discussed, Mr. Gandhi said that he was not expected to be present at any of the meetings of the Committee because of his health.
('41', 71, 1, 3, 136834) It was against the instruction of doctors and against the wishes of his friends that he had gone to Madras which he did only in order to help to the best of his ability Mr. Srinivasa Aiyengar and Dr. Ansari and to be available to them if at all it was necessary.
('41', 71, 1, 4, 137097) He was not supposed to take any part in the deliberations of the Working Committee, Subjects Committee or even in the open Session.
('41', 71, 1, 5, 137229) He never attended any of the Committee meetings except one informal meeting and attended the Congress at the opening only for a few minutes.
('41', 71, 2, 6, 137370) Our representative asked: But is it true that you did not approve of the Independence Resolution? ANSWER: That is an open secret.
('41', 71, 2, 7, 137500) But my disapproval of the Independence Resolution is based upon grounds that are not common to those who generally condemn the Independence Resolution.
('41', 71, 2, 8, 137652) I dealt with the subject last year when the Independence resolution was passed and I have given my reasons for my attitude towards it.
('41', 71, 2, 9, 137787) Let me, however, guard myself against any possible misunderstanding.
('41', 71, 2, 10, 137856) I do not for one moment consider that India is not fit for independence, or that she is not ripe for it.
('41', 71, 3, 11, 137961) Our representative next mentioned the death 1 of Hakim Ajmal Khan and Mr. Gandhi made the following statement : It is a great and grievous loss at this juncture.
('41', 71, 3, 12, 138123) Hakim Ajmal Khan was one of the truest servants of India and for the cause of Hindu Muslim unity he was one of the most invaluable men.
('41', 71, 3, 13, 138259) I can but hope that what we did not do and learn during his lifetime we shall now learn after and by his death.
('41', 71, 3, 14, 138371) If the accounts that have been published, viz., that Hindus took part in paying respect to the memory of the deceased in just as large numbers as the Mussalmans, are true, it is a very healthy sign and I hope that the spirit of brotherhood and friendliness that has been evoked in Delhi by his death will continue and become permanent and percolate throughout the length and breadth of the land.
('41', 71, 3, 15, 138767) For me the death of Hakimji is a deep personal loss.
('41', 71, 3, 16, 138820) I entirely associate myself with the appeal issued by Dr. Ansari and other leaders that the National Muslim University at Delhi which Hakimji nursed with very delicate care should be placed beyond any risk by patriotic Indians subscribing to the Fund that Hakimji was raising for putting its finances on a firm footing.
('41', 71, 3, 17, 139140) But, of course, the best monument to be raised to the memory of the great patriot would be to

('41', 72, 3, 5, 139474) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got both your letters.
('41', 72, 3, 6, 139520) I have now returned to the Ashram, and shall know, therefore, what letters arrive.
('41', 72, 3, 7, 139603) You gave at least one particular in your letter, and that was good.
('41', 72, 3, 8, 139671) I understand what you say about Sastriji.
('41', 72, 3, 9, 139713) You can boldly, but courteously, tell him what you may wish to.
('41', 72, 3, 10, 139777) You have given a good description of your conversation with him.
('41', 72, 3, 11, 139842) I certainly like the idea of closing the Durban Office.
('41', 72, 3, 12, 139898) Personally, I believe that, if the paper does not run on its own merit, we should not be too eager to continue it.
('41', 72, 3, 13, 140013) If it runs on its own merit, it should without difficulty run even from Phnix.
('41', 72, 3, 14, 140092) Do not run it by incurring debts or simply for the sake of running it.
('41', 72, 3, 15, 140163) In this matter, at any rate, please do accept my advice.
('41', 72, 3, 16, 140220) If you find it difficult to stay there on this condition, both of you should return here.
('41', 72, 3, 17, 140310) Do not wait till it is too late.
('41', 72, 3, 18, 140343) You have not replied to what I said about the money you owe to the Ashram.
('41', 72, 3, 19, 140418) This is to remind you again.
('41', 72, 3, 20, 140447) And now to Sushila : Your letters are dull.
('41', 72, 3, 21, 140491) Manilal is justified in saying that, being very busy with work, he cannot write much, but you certainly ought to write.
('41', 72, 3, 22, 140611) If you have interest in life, you will find much to write about.
('41', 72, 3, 23, 140676) Sons and daughters fill sheets and sheets when writing to their parents about their happy and unhappy experiences, but your letters contain no more than a few lines.
('41', 72, 3, 24, 140842) Your physique does not seem yet to have become stronger.
('41', 72, 3, 25, 140899) If you wish, you may consult some doctor there.
('41', 72, 3, 26, 140947) Do anything, but get strong.
('41', 72, 3, 27, 140976) If you wish to return here, discuss the matter between you two.
('41', 72, 3, 28, 141040) So far as I am concerned, you have my permission.
('41', 72, 3, 29, 141090) It will also be for you to decide where you will live.
('41', 72, 3, 30, 141145) You may live either here or at Akola.
('41', 72, 3, 31, 141183) Think of me not as a father in law but as a father.
('41', 72, 3, 32, 141235) In order that you may be able to do some service, it is also your duty to take care of your body.
('41', 72, 3, 33, 141333) Do not neglect that duty.

('41', 73, 1, 5, 141486) Balubhai, too, saw me.
('41', 73, 1, 6, 141509) Let me know : The time when you get up and the hours of meals.
('41', 73, 1, 7, 141572) How often and what you eat.

('41', 74, 4, 8, 143223) I do not even know where you have gone.

('41', 74, 4, 11, 143383) Self denial pays only to the extent that it is endurable.

('41', 76, 3, 8, 145707) For that, you must be completely absorbed in your work.
('41', 76, 3, 9, 145763) If you absorb yourself in your work, you can conquer your attachment and passion.
('41', 76, 3, 10, 145845) In this age there is no greater religion than service.
('41', 76, 3, 11, 145900) In my view it is the greatest religion in all ages.

('41', 76, 3, 19, 146387) Along with these, your study of Gujarati, Hindi and Sanskrit should continue.

('41', 77, 1, 5, 147427) You should learn Sanskrit even if you have to work by yourself.

('41', 78, 3, 4, 148870) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I feel that you love me too well to resent what I am about to write.
('41', 78, 3, 5, 148959) In any case I love you too well to restrain my pen when I feel I must write.
('41', 78, 3, 6, 149036) You are going too fast.
('41', 78, 3, 7, 149060) You should have taken time to think and become acclimatized.
('41', 78, 3, 8, 149121) Most of the resolutions you framed and got carried could have been delayed for one year.
('41', 78, 3, 9, 149210) Your plunging into the republican army was a hasty step.
('41', 78, 3, 10, 149267) But I do not mind these acts of yours so much as I mind your encouraging mischief makers and hooligans.
('41', 78, 3, 11, 149371) I do not know whether you still believe in unadulterated non violence.
('41', 78, 3, 12, 149442) But even if you have altered your views, you could not think that unlicensed and unbridled violence is going to deliver the country.
('41', 78, 3, 13, 149575) If careful observation of the country in the light of your European experiences convinces you of the error of the current ways and means, by all means enforce your own views, but do please form a disciplined party.
('41', 78, 3, 14, 149790) You know the Cawnpore experiences.
('41', 78, 3, 15, 149825) In every struggle bands of men who would submit to discipline are needed.
('41', 78, 3, 16, 149899) You seem to be overlooking this factor in being careless about your instruments.
('41', 78, 3, 17, 149980) If I can advise you, now that you are the working secretary of the Indian National Congress, it is your duty to devote your whole energy to the central resolution, i.e., Unity, and the important but secondary resolution, i.e., boycott of the Simon Commission.
('41', 78, 3, 18, 150240) 2 The Unity resolution 3 requires the use of all you great gifts of organization and persuasion.
('41', 78, 4, 19, 150337) 1 This was published along with the following note from Jawaharlal Nehru: I returned from Europe in December 1927 and went straight to the Madras Session of the Indian National Congress.
('41', 78, 4, 20, 150524) A number of resolutions were passed there at my instance.
('41', 78, 4, 21, 150582) This letter was written by Gandhiji because he did not approve of some of my activities at this session. 2Vide Appendix extract from Statement by the Viceroy on the Indian Statutory Commission, November 8, 1927. 3 Vide Appendix resolution on Hindu Muslim Unity, December 26, 1927.

('41', 79, 3, 5, 151041) 98. IN MEMORIAM
('41', 79, 4, 6, 151057) In the death of Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan the country has lost one of its truest servants.
('41', 79, 4, 7, 151145) Hakim Sahebs was a many sided personality.
('41', 79, 4, 8, 151188) He was not merely an able physician who practised his art as much for the rich as for the poor.
('41', 79, 4, 9, 151284) But he was a courtier patriot.
('41', 79, 4, 10, 151315) Though he passed his time among potentates, he was a thorough going democrat.
('41', 79, 4, 11, 151393) He was a great Mussalman and equally great Indian.
('41', 79, 4, 12, 151444) He loved equally Hindus and Mussalmans and was in turn equally respected and loved by both.
('41', 79, 4, 13, 151536) Hindu Muslim unity was the breath of his nostrils.
('41', 79, 4, 14, 151587) His later days were soured because of our dissensions.
('41', 79, 4, 15, 151642) But he never lost faith in his country or his people.
('41', 79, 4, 16, 151696) He felt that both the communities were bound in the end to unite.
('41', 79, 4, 17, 151762) Having that unchangeable faith, he never ceased to work for unity.
('41', 79, 4, 18, 151829) Though he took time, he finally threw in his lot with the non co operators and did not hesitate to put in peril his fondest and greatest creation, the Tibbia College.
('41', 79, 4, 19, 151996) He loved this College with a passion which only those who knew him well could realize.
('41', 79, 4, 20, 152083) In Hakimji I have lost not merely a wise and steadfast co worker, I have lost a friend on whom I could rely in the hour of need.
('41', 79, 4, 21, 152212) He was my constant guide in the matter of Hindu Muslim unity.
('41', 79, 4, 22, 152274) His judge ment, sobriety and knowledge of human nature enabled him for the most part to give correct decisions.
('41', 79, 4, 23, 152386) Such a man never dies.
('41', 79, 4, 24, 152409) Though he is no longer in the flesh with us, his spirit shall be ever with us and calls us even now to a faithful discharge of our duty.
('41', 79, 4, 25, 152546) And no memo rial that we can raise to perpetuate his memory can be complete until we have achieved real Hindu Muslim unity.
('41', 79, 4, 26, 152670) May God grant that we may learn to do through his death what we failed to do in his lifetime.
('41', 79, 4, 27, 152764) But Hakimji was no idle dreamer.
('41', 79, 4, 28, 152797) He believed in realizing his dream.
('41', 79, 4, 29, 152833) As he realized his dream about medicine through the Tibbia College, so he sought partially to realize his political dream through the Jamia Millia.
('41', 79, 4, 30, 152981) When this national university was almost on the point of dying, he, almost single handed, carried out a plan of removing the institution from Aligarh to Delhi.
('41', 79, 4, 31, 153141) But the removal meant more worry
('41', 80, 0, 1, 153174) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 81
('41', 80, 1, 2, 153215) for him.
('41', 80, 1, 3, 153224) He believed himself hence forward to be specially responsible for the financial stability of the College.
('41', 80, 1, 4, 153330) He was the principal man to find support for it either from his own pocket or by way of contributions collected from personal friends.
('41', 80, 1, 5, 153465) The immediate and indispensable memorial that the nation can raise is to put the financial condition of the Jamia on a stable basis.
('41', 80, 1, 6, 153598) Both Hindus and Mussalmans are and should be equally interested in it.
('41', 80, 1, 7, 153669) It is one of the four national universities still struggling for existence, the other three being the Bihar, Kashi and Gujarat Vidyapiths.
('41', 80, 1, 8, 153808) When the Jamia was brought into being Hindus subscribed liberally to it.
('41', 80, 1, 9, 153881) The national ideal has been kept intact in this Muslim institution.
('41', 80, 1, 10, 153949) I commend to the attention of the reader the note 1 prepared by Sjt.
('41', 80, 1, 11, 154018) Ramachandran 2 out of his own experience covering over twelve months.
('41', 80, 1, 12, 154088) In Principal Zakir Husain it has a learned Principal of liberal views and undoubted nationalism.
('41', 80, 1, 13, 154185) The Principal is ably assisted by a chosen staff some of whom have travelled abroad and possess foreign degrees.
('41', 80, 1, 14, 154298) The institution has grown since its transfer to Delhi and if it is well supported, it promises rich results.
('41', 80, 1, 15, 154407) There can be no doubt that it is the duty of those Hindus and Mussalmans who wish to honour the memory of Hakim Saheb, who believe in the constructive side of non co operation and who believe in Hindu Muslim unity, to give as much financial assistance as is possible for them to give.
('41', 80, 1, 16, 154692) Dr. Ansari, Sjt.
('41', 80, 1, 17, 154709) Srinivasa Aiyengar, Seth Jamnalal Bajaj and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru have already issued an appeal in this matter.
('41', 80, 1, 18, 154823) I am now trying through Principal Zakir Husain to find out the exact condition and placing myself in correspondence with Dr. Ansari, and as soon as I have collected enough information, I hope to lay it before the readers.
('41', 80, 1, 19, 155045) In the mean time I invite subscriptions so as not to lose time.
('41', 80, 1, 20, 155109) The subscriptions received will not be handed to anyone unless a proper committee is formed and an absolutely correct administration of funds is assured.
('41', 80, 1, 21, 155263) I do hope that Hindus and Mussalmans swill vie with one another to well the subscription list.

('41', 81, 1, 2, 155526) 99. THE NATIONAL CONGRESS
('41', 81, 3, 3, 155552) The special feature of Dr. Ansaris speech was its intense hunger for unity.
('41', 81, 3, 4, 155628) He knew that he was expected to bring it about.
('41', 81, 3, 5, 155676) And if any single person could do it, it was certainly Dr. Ansari.
('41', 81, 3, 6, 155743) He accepted the highest honour in the gift of the nation because he had confidence in the nation, the cause and himself.
('41', 81, 3, 7, 155864) He certainly left no stone unturned to achieve his ambition.
('41', 81, 3, 8, 155925) Stars favoured him.
('41', 81, 3, 9, 155945) Srinivasa Aiyengar helped him by his very recklessness.
('41', 81, 3, 10, 156001) No other president would perhaps have dared as he did after the partial failure at Simla.
('41', 81, 3, 11, 156091) But Sjt.
('41', 81, 3, 12, 156100) Aiyengar was not the man to shrink.
('41', 81, 3, 13, 156136) He took Dr. Ansari, the Ali Brothers, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and others with him and with his accustomed impetuosity carried his resolution.
('41', 81, 3, 14, 156278) He was not committed to any formula.
('41', 81, 3, 15, 156315) When the almost fatal flaw in the resolution about the cow and music was pointed out and a substitute submitted, he whole heartedly, frankly and generously admitted the flaw and accepted the substitute as a great improvement on the original.
('41', 81, 3, 16, 156557) The Mussalmans present rose to the occasion and, though not without some reluctance and hesitation at first, accepted the substitute without reserve.
('41', 81, 3, 17, 156707) Pandit Malaviyaji had come with the full intention of accommodating himself to the general wish so far as it was possible for him.
('41', 81, 3, 18, 156838) He knew and everybody realized that it was within his power to block the way.
('41', 81, 3, 19, 156916) He did not.
('41', 81, 3, 20, 156928) True, he had many amendments which he considered were necessary but he was not going to resist the resolution if his amendments could not be carried.
('41', 81, 3, 21, 157078) Pandit Malaviyaji is probably the oldest Congressman.
('41', 81, 3, 22, 157132) His loyalty to the Congress is beyond compare.
('41', 81, 3, 23, 157179) His patriotism is of the highest order.
('41', 81, 3, 24, 157219) But my Mussalman friends have hitherto always belittled my faith in his bona fides and nationalism as against communalism.
('41', 81, 3, 25, 157342) I have never been able to suspect either even where I have not been able to share his views on Hindu Muslim questions.
('41', 81, 3, 26, 157461) It was, therefore, a great joy to me that the Ali Brothers warmly acclaimed his great speech on the unity resolution.
('41', 81, 3, 27, 157579) So long as Hindu and Mussalman leaders distrust one anothers motives, speeches and actions, there can be no real unity in spite of perfect resolutions.
('41', 81, 3, 28, 157731) Let us hope that the trust generated at the meeting will continue and prove highly infectious.
('41', 81, 3, 29, 157826) Maulana Mahomed Ali, in his joy over Malaviyajis speech, said that the Mussalmans no longer wanted protection of minorities from Earl Winterton for it could be
('41', 82, 0, 1, 157986) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 83
('41', 82, 1, 2, 158027) better secured by Malaviyaji.
('41', 82, 1, 3, 158057) If there be one Hindu who can guarantee such protection on behalf of Hindus it is Malaviyaji.
('41', 82, 1, 4, 158151) But whether he can deliver goods or not, I would like the Maulana and the other Mussalmans and all minorities once for all to renounce the idea of expecting or getting protection from a third party.
('41', 82, 1, 5, 158350) It were better, if such protection be not given voluntarily by the majority, to wrest it by force from unwilling hands than that a third party should be invited to intervene and should weaken and humiliate both and hold the nation under bondage.
('41', 82, 1, 6, 158596) The greatest contribution of the Congress then to me was this apparent change of heart.
('41', 82, 1, 7, 158684) So far as the vast mass of Hindus are concerned, they are interested only in the cow and music resolution.
('41', 82, 1, 8, 158791) It was wholly bad in its original form.
('41', 82, 1, 9, 158831) As it has finally emerged from the Subjects Committee and passed, all that can be said for it is that it is innocuous and that it is the best that could be had at this stage of the national evolution.
('41', 82, 1, 10, 159032) But I for one cannot enthuse over it.
('41', 82, 1, 11, 159070) I can only tolerate it as passable.
('41', 82, 1, 12, 159106) Nevertheless it has great possibilities.
('41', 82, 1, 13, 159147) If the appeal of the Congress penetrates the hearts of Hindus and Mussalmans and if each party spares the feelings of the other in terms of the claims advanced by each, peace is in sight and swaraj within easy grasp.
('41', 82, 1, 14, 159364) A definite realization of the folly of fratricide and corresponding action will be the best and the most dignified answer to Lord Birkenheads insolent flaunting of British might in the nations face.
('41', 82, 1, 15, 159563) It is, therefore, profitable to examine the meaning of the Congress appeal.
('41', 82, 1, 16, 159639) I know what would spare the Hindus feeling in the matter of the cow.
('41', 82, 1, 17, 159708) It is nothing short of complete voluntary stoppage of cow slaughter by Mussalmans whether for sacrifice or for food.
('41', 82, 1, 18, 159825) The Hindu dharma will not be satisfied if some tyrant secured by force of arms immunity of the cow from the slaughter.
('41', 82, 1, 19, 159944) Islam in India cannot make a better gift to the Hindus than this voluntary self denial.
('41', 82, 1, 20, 160032) And I know enough of Islam to be able to assert that Islam does not compel cow slaughter and it does compel its followers to spare and respect to the full the feelings of their neighbours whenever it is humanly possible.
('41', 82, 1, 21, 160253) For me, music before mosques is not on a par with cow slaughter.
('41', 82, 1, 22, 160318) But it has assumed an importance which it would be folly to ignore.
('41', 82, 1, 23, 160386) It is for the Mussalmans to say what would spare Mussalman feelings.
('41', 82, 1, 24, 160455) And if complete stoppage of music before mosques will be the only thing that will spare the Mussalman feelings, it is the duty of the Hindus to do so without a moments thought.
('41', 83, 0, 1, 160632) 84 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 83, 1, 2, 160673) we are to reach unity of hearts, we must each be prepared to perform an adequate measure of sacrifice.
('41', 83, 1, 3, 160776) If this much to be desired consummation is to be reached, Dr. Ansari will have to send out peace parties with definite instructions to preach the message and secure for it the approval of the masses.
('41', 83, 1, 4, 160976) Have we sufficient energy for the mission, have we enough honest, industrious and willing missionaries?
('41', 83, 1, 5, 161080) Let us hope.
('41', 83, 1, 6, 161093) IRRESPONSIBILITY Though I was not able to attend any of the Committee meet ings, I could not fail to perceive that irresponsible talk and work were the order of the day.
('41', 83, 1, 7, 161263) Indiscipline was not a rare feature.
('41', 83, 1, 8, 161300) Resolutions involving great consequences were sprung upon the Subjects Com mittee and readily accepted by that august body without much thought or discussion.
('41', 83, 1, 9, 161459) The Independence Resolution 1 that was rejected last year was passed almost without opposition.
('41', 83, 1, 10, 161555) I know that its wording was harmless but, in my humble opinion, it was hastily conceived and thoughtlessly passed.
('41', 83, 1, 11, 161670) I hope to deal with this resolution separately in an early issue.
('41', 83, 2, 12, 161736) The boycott of British goods resolution was passed with an equally light heart.
('41', 83, 2, 13, 161816) The Congress stultifies itself by repeating year after year resolutions of this character when it knows that it is not capable of carrying them into effect.
('41', 83, 2, 14, 161973) By passing such resolutions we make an exhibition of our impotence, become the laughing stock of critics and invite the contempt of the adversary.
('41', 83, 2, 15, 162120) Let me not be misunderstood.
('41', 83, 2, 16, 162149) The Congress has a perfect right to boycott British goods if it so wishes.
('41', 83, 2, 17, 162224) But as the most representative assembly in India, it has no right to expose itself to ridicule by using threats which it cannot carry into effect.
('41', 83, 2, 18, 162371) I have singled out but two out of the several irresponsible resolutions passed by the Congress.
('41', 83, 2, 19, 162467) The conception behind the Congress constitution was to make it the most representative and authoritative body in all India, and by its commanding voluntary obedience on the part of millions, automa tically, almost imperceptibly to replace the sham enslaving assemblies and councils and other foreign machinery masquerading under the name of representative bodies.
('41', 83, 2, 20, 162831) But the Congress cannot become the irresistible force it was and is intended to be, if its resolutions are ill conceived and are to remain merely paper resolutions having no

('41', 84, 1, 2, 163150) response from the people or having no correspondence to the popular wants and aspirations and if the members are not to observe the rules of discipline, decorum and common honesty.
('41', 84, 1, 3, 163331) If they only knew, if they would regard themselves as servants of the nation, the members of the All India Congress Committee have the rights and opportunities of service equal to those of the members of any parliament in the world.
('41', 84, 1, 4, 163564) But at the present moment, we have almost sunk to the level of the schoolboys debating society.
('41', 84, 1, 5, 163660) The Working Committee is the national cabinet.
('41', 84, 1, 6, 163707) It has to enforce the resolutions of the Congress and the All India Congress Com mittee.
('41', 84, 1, 7, 163796) It must, therefore, be the body responsible for bringing before the A.I.C.C. resolutions required for the attainment of the Congress goal.
('41', 84, 1, 8, 163935) Any non official resolutions sprung upon the A.I.C.C. must be carefully scrutinized and should have but a remote chance of passing, if opposed by the Working Committee.
('41', 84, 1, 9, 164104) Every resolution, official or unofficial, must have behind it a working plan.
('41', 84, 1, 10, 164182) When, therefore, an unofficial resolution is brought forward, the sponsor must be prepared to disclose his plan of action if his proposal is to be accepted.
('41', 84, 1, 11, 164339) A resolution proposing the establishment in every village of a free night school for its adult population has everything to commend itself to a body like the Congress.
('41', 84, 1, 12, 164507) But if the proposer has no definite feasible plan of action behind it, the A.I.C.C. would be justified and bound to reject it summarily.
('41', 84, 1, 13, 164644) If then the Congress is to retain its prestige and usefulness, the members of the A.I.C.C. will have to revise their attitude and realize their great responsibility.
('41', 84, 2, 14, 164810) THE ELEPHANT AND THE ANT
('41', 84, 3, 15, 164835) In my humble opinion, the Reception Committee of the Congress at Madras committed a grave blunder by permitting and countenancing the so called All India Exhibition under its aegis.
('41', 84, 3, 16, 165017) That it received Government patronage and imprimatur adds nothing to its merit, if it does not rob it of what little merit it otherwise might have had.
('41', 84, 3, 17, 165169) The Congress long ago outlived Government favours and frowns.
('41', 84, 3, 18, 165231) The ideals for which the Congress has been working since, say, 1918, to go no further back, were almost all ignored in the plan of this Exhibition.
('41', 84, 3, 19, 165379) Let me point out what the All India Exhibition contained.
('41', 84, 3, 20, 165437) Among the pavilions were several assigned to foreign firms for exhibiting their wares, one assigned to machinery and mechanical contrivances, some to textiles containing foreign yarn, others to foreign clocks and watches.
('41', 84, 3, 21, 165659) There was little of swadeshi, much of
('41', 85, 0, 1, 165697) 86 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 85, 1, 2, 165738) foreign and British goods about the Exhibition, and this in the name of and under the patronage of a Congress which promulgates the gospel of swadeshi and which has on its programme a boycott of British goods!
('41', 85, 1, 3, 165948) There was hardly anything to interest or instruct the villagers.
('41', 85, 1, 4, 166013) The Exhibition represented not the rural civilization of India, but the exploiting city civilization of the West.
('41', 85, 1, 5, 166127) It was a denial of the Congress spirit and was in marked contrast to the khadi and swadeshi exhibitions of the past six years.
('41', 85, 1, 6, 166254) The textile court seemed to have been designed to ridicule khadi although the Congress still retains the khadi franchise and lends its name to the activities of the All India Spinners Association.
('41', 85, 1, 7, 166451) As if the visitors were to be all English, all the notices were printed in English.
('41', 85, 1, 8, 166535) Here is one designed to belittle khadi.
('41', 85, 2, 9, 166575) Feed the poor and work the able.
('41', 85, 2, 10, 166608) Let the charkha spin the weft And the mill the warp.
('41', 85, 2, 11, 166661) In this combination lies the solution Unless the author of this notice has a deliberately mischievous intention, he has demonstrated his ignorance of the evolution of khadi.
('41', 85, 2, 12, 166835) The fallacy of charkha weft and mill warp has been often exposed and refuted in these columns.
('41', 85, 2, 13, 166930) Suffice it here to say that the charkha would have died a well deserved death if the policy of using charkha yarn for weft only had long continued.
('41', 85, 2, 14, 167078) Experience has shown that the combination was bad in every respect.
('41', 85, 2, 15, 167146) Here is another equally, if not more, mischievous poster :
('41', 85, 3, 16, 167205) To force a weaver to use hand spun warp yarn
('41', 85, 4, 17, 167250) Is like forcing him to fight a battleship with a knife.
('41', 85, 5, 18, 167306) To cut a weaver off from best methods of work
('41', 85, 6, 19, 167352) Is like cutting off his thumbs.
('41', 85, 6, 20, 167384) This poster betrays venomous prejudice against khadi and ignorance of the art of weaving and the condition of weavers.
('41', 85, 6, 21, 167503) The writer forgets that all the world over, a time was when weavers took delight in using hand spun yarn both for weft and warp and that the art then exhibited by the weaver has never yet been excelled.
('41', 85, 6, 22, 167706) The writer could easily have corrected himself by visiting the khadi court outside the precious All India Exhibition court.
('41', 85, 6, 23, 167830) He would there have seen weavers actually working fairy tales on hand spun warp with the same ease and facility that they would have with mill spun yarn.
('41', 85, 6, 24, 167984) It is easy of proof that, whereas mill spun yarn must in timenot far off

('41', 86, 1, 2, 168098) kill out the weaver, hand spun yarn must revive and is reviving the weaver and has already rescued some of them from the butchers trade and closet cleaning work.
('41', 86, 1, 3, 168260) Every ten hand spinners mean an addition of one whole time weaver, one whole time carder, not to mention more work for dhobis, tailors, carpenters, blacksmiths, dyers, printers, etc.
('41', 86, 1, 4, 168443) The coming into being of this foreign and anti India spirit exhibition under the Congress aegis is an ocular and forcible demonstration of the irresponsibility to which I have already adverted.
('41', 86, 1, 5, 168637) I do not think any Congressman deliberately countenanced this white elephant.
('41', 86, 1, 6, 168715) Want of thought, want of care, want of responsibility are answerable forI cannot help callingthis scandalous creation.
('41', 86, 1, 7, 168834) There was no doubt the ant of the Khadi Exhibition was happily thrown outside the elephant court.
('41', 86, 1, 8, 168932) Rumour has it that the Madras Government would not have a Khadi Exhibition inside the all india court.
('41', 86, 1, 9, 169035) It certainly suited me.
('41', 86, 1, 10, 169059) For, having gained a knowledge of what this all india exhibition was, I would have found it difficult, if not impossible, even for opening the Khadi Exhibition to enter what was chiefly a foreign courta reminder of national humiliation.
('41', 86, 1, 11, 169296) The Khadi Exhibition on the other hand was, though like an ant, a work of indigenous art.
('41', 86, 1, 12, 169386) It was a school for study and demonstration of the potency of khadi.
('41', 86, 1, 13, 169455) There was beside it an Indian fine arts court, a result of the devoted labours of Dr. J. H. Cousins.
('41', 86, 1, 14, 169556) No doubt there were a few other things purely Indian or a result of Indian enterprise in the so called All India Exhibition.
('41', 86, 1, 15, 169681) But they only served to entrap the unwary and as a shield for the predominant foreign show.

('41', 86, 3, 19, 169865) Shrimati Sarojini Devi has received a call 1 from America chiefly for the purpose of undoing the mischief created by Miss Mayos untruthful and libellous production.
('41', 86, 3, 20, 170030) No writing undertaken in India can possibly overtake the mischief done by that sensation monger who has the ear of a gullible publichungering for and living on sensation.
('41', 86, 3, 21, 170201) No serious American can possibly be taken in by Miss Mayos scurrilous writings.

('41', 87, 1, 3, 170431) And the general public that has been already affected by Mother India will never read the refutations, however brilliant, attempted in India.
('41', 87, 1, 4, 170573) The idea, therefore, has been happily conceived in America of bringing out Sarojini Devi on a lecturing tour by way of reply to Mother India.
('41', 87, 1, 5, 170715) If Sarojini Devi would respond to the invitation, her visit is likely to undo some at least of the mischief wrought by Miss Mayos novel.
('41', 87, 1, 6, 170852) That the Poetess would draw crowds wherever she goes and command a patient and respectful hearing need not be doubted.
('41', 87, 1, 7, 170971) She is as sure by the magic of her eloquence to captivate American imagination as she captivated South African and paved the way for the Round Table Conference, and finally for the great work that the Right Honourable Srinivasa Sastri is doing in South Africa.
('41', 87, 1, 8, 171232) Let us hope that the way would be clear for her to accept the invitation and that Dr. Ansari would be able to spare her for the foreign mission that seems to call this gifted daughter of India.

('41', 90, 7, 20, 175920) January 7, 1928
('41', 90, 8, 21, 175936) This chapter 3 is as sweet as the manner in which it has been sung.
('41', 90, 8, 22, 176004) It is balm for people like us who suffer from inner torments.
('41', 90, 8, 23, 176066) We are all troubled by evil desires, and the Lord holds out an assurance here to all those who seek refuge in Him that He will free them from such desires.
('41', 90, 8, 24, 176222) We can also see from this chapter that at the time when the Gita was composed, distinctions of high and low had already made their appearance in the varnashrama system and some had come to be regarded as lower than others.
('41', 90, 8, 25, 176445) In truth, however, can we describe anyone as higher or lower than others?
('41', 90, 8, 26, 176519) Let him who is completely free from evil desires point an accusing finger at another.
('41', 90, 8, 27, 176605) All of us are equal in this regard, and this chapter points out the unfailing means of winning freedom from evil cravings, namely, total surrender to the

('41', 91, 0, 1, 176915) 92 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 91, 1, 2, 176956) We should not of course conclude from this that such surrender will by itself, without further effort on our part, purify us of our evil.
('41', 91, 1, 3, 177094) If a person who is dragged by his senses, against his will, to objects of pleasures turns to God for help, with tears in his eyes, as he ceaselessly struggles against them, the Lord will certainly free him from the evil desires which trouble him.
('41', 91, 1, 4, 177341) Another thought also arises out of it, but we shall consider it tomorrow.
('41', 91, 1, 5, 177415) That thought is that this also explains the means of expiation of ones sins.
('41', 91, 1, 6, 177492) Such expiation consists not in fasting, but in bhakti, in self surrender.
('41', 91, 1, 7, 177566) I fully understand the usefulness of fasting but there are also limits to it.
('41', 91, 1, 8, 177644) Fasting can never expiate a sin; it may, on the contrary, serve to cover it up.
('41', 91, 1, 9, 177724) A sinner is one who has committed a sin, but papayoni means one born of sin itself and therefore the most wicked of all sinners.
('41', 91, 1, 10, 177853) We cannot say to whom this notion first occurred, but everyone is assured of freedom through total surrender to the Lord.
('41', 91, 1, 11, 177975) Expiation of sin consists in bhakti.
('41', 91, 1, 12, 178012) Fasting may seem necessary sometimes as a means of filling the heart with bhakti, and everyone may decide for himself when it is so.
('41', 91, 1, 13, 178145) The real means, however, is bhakti, and bhakti means reducing oneself to a cipher, erasing the I.
('41', 91, 1, 14, 178243) If we can do this, no matter how many our sins in the past, they will not stand in the way of our freedom.
('41', 91, 1, 15, 178350) The thoroughly wicked mentioned in this chapter are none else but ourselves.
('41', 91, 1, 16, 178427) We, who commit all manner of sins in our hearts and move in the world as respectable people, are sinners, all of us, and in this chapter the Lord holds out an assurance to us.
('41', 91, 1, 17, 178603) Chapter XIV contains a description of the three gunas and Chapter XV a description of Purushottama 1. Thirty years ago I read Drummonds 2 book in which he had established by means of several examples that the rules of the material world apply to the spiritual world also.
('41', 91, 1, 18, 178875) We see it proved in this world which is made of the three gunas.
('41', 91, 1, 19, 178940) There are not three gunas but many; those three are the major divisions of the many.
('41', 91, 1, 20, 179025) He who transcends those three becomes one with Purushottama.
('41', 91, 1, 21, 179086) None has been born in this world who could exist with only one guna.
('41', 91, 1, 22, 179155) Even if a man possesses a high degree of the sattvik guna, the latter still includes something of the gunas of tamas

('41', 92, 1, 3, 179451) The example of water occurs to me.
('41', 92, 1, 4, 179486) In the form of ice, it remains like a stone.
('41', 92, 1, 5, 179531) But when it boils and becomes steam, it rises in the sky.
('41', 92, 1, 6, 179589) As ice it lacks the capacity to rise, but as steam, it ascends higher and higher.
('41', 92, 1, 7, 179671) Its highest power appears in the form of steam.
('41', 92, 1, 8, 179719) And finally, ceasing to be steam, it becomes a cloud and benefits the world in the form of rain.
('41', 92, 1, 9, 179816) However, if steam becomes ice, it lies dead and still.
('41', 92, 1, 10, 179871) Ice too has its uses.
('41', 92, 1, 11, 179893) Melted ice flows in the form of rivers.
('41', 92, 1, 12, 179933) It also causes floods but we are not concerned with that.
('41', 92, 1, 13, 179991) It is a proven fact that without the sun, even water cannot turn into steam.
('41', 92, 1, 14, 180068) But that shows that it cannot do without someone elses help.
('41', 92, 1, 15, 180129) The long and short of what I want to say is that steam points to a state of moksha.
('41', 92, 1, 16, 180213) It benefits the world in its state of moksha.
('41', 92, 1, 17, 180259) This is how we should understand the meaning of these two chapters.

('41', 93, 2, 3, 181219) On reading this, I asked him to enlighten me about his own experience whereupon he wrote the following letter 3 : The suggestions put forward in both these letters may be freely utilized in treating many ailments.
('41', 93, 2, 4, 181433) I am of the opinion that mud cannot be placed directly on the skin where there is an wound or the skin has peeled off.
('41', 93, 2, 5, 181552) It can certainly be applied in this manner on the lower part of the abdomen and those who do not benefit by using a pack of mud wrapped up in cloth may certainly place it directly over the skin.
('41', 93, 2, 6, 181747) Even at present, I am experimenting with mud in ordinary cases and am getting good results.
('41', 93, 2, 7, 181839) This remedy is so simple, inexpensive and so easy that everyone could make use of it within limits.
('41', 93, 2, 8, 181939) True, the treatment of placing mud on the abdomen can be carried out only on an empty stomach.
('41', 93, 2, 9, 182034) One should also remember that the mud should always be taken from a clean place.
('41', 93, 2, 10, 182115) Ice is used for headache or fever; in such cases, mud is generally more efficacious than ice.

('41', 93, 5, 14, 182321) DEAR FRIEND, I was sorry that during my recent tour in Utkal I was not able to visit your Raj and see for myself whether there was anything in the allegations made to me about the oppression of the ryots.

('41', 97, 3, 4, 186865) BHAISHRI NAJUKLAL, It is good that you have started the mud pack treatment.
('41', 97, 3, 5, 186941) After moistening the earth once, you need not do it again.
('41', 97, 3, 6, 187000) If the pack dries up and if it is still necessary to continue the application, you may prepare another pack.
('41', 97, 3, 7, 187109) If the pack is about an inch thick, it does not dry up.
('41', 97, 3, 8, 187165) A pack applied on the stomach at night remains damp the whole night.
('41', 97, 3, 9, 187234) One applied on the head during the noon is likely to dry up.
('41', 97, 3, 10, 187295) Never put a pack on the stomach during the day, because the process of digestion is going on then.
('41', 97, 3, 11, 187394) My experience about fragrant, i.e., clean red earth is good, but you may use black earth if you can get only that.
('41', 97, 3, 12, 187509) The only thing is that it should be clean.
('41', 97, 3, 13, 187552) You should be careful about two things only as regards blood pressure.
('41', 97, 3, 14, 187623) You should not overwork either physically or mentally, and the motion must always be clear.
('41', 97, 3, 15, 187715) If you do not have a clear motion every day, take an enema or a laxative.
('41', 97, 3, 16, 187789) Never strain.
('41', 97, 3, 17, 187803) Eat very light food.
('41', 97, 3, 18, 187824) One need not worry about blood pressure at all, if there is no other complaint.
('41', 97, 3, 19, 187904) Since, however, you have had an attack of paralysis, you should certainly be careful.
('41', 97, 3, 20, 187990) In addition to what you are doing, you may certainly take the injections, if advised by the doctor, since they have helped you.
('41', 97, 3, 21, 188118) The headache should certainly be cured by the mud pack.
('41', 97, 3, 22, 188174) Even for this purpose, however, the stomach should be light.
('41', 97, 3, 23, 188235) Prabodh seems to be a very fine boy.

('41', 99, 3, 5, 189520) It reminded me of the head master in Tiruppur who, having been your pupil, told me that you were as much master of Sanskrit as of English.
('41', 99, 3, 6, 189659) I did not know this.

('41', 99, 3, 10, 189885) And in doing so, she excelled herself.
('41', 99, 3, 11, 189924) Similarly did Rama excel himself in carrying out the promise of Dasharatha.
('41', 99, 3, 12, 190000) But I am arguing to no purpose.
('41', 99, 3, 13, 190032) For we are alone in the homage we owe to Rama and Sita.
('41', 99, 3, 14, 190088) I am watching your movements and prize copies of your letters to Sir Mohammad Habibullah 2. You will have to prolong your stay if you are to put your great work on a sure foundation.

('41', 101, 2, 3, 192210) [Before January 12, 1928] I have to give you this evening an instance of a folly of which three of us have an equal share.
('41', 101, 2, 4, 192333) Or rather my share is the biggest inasmuch as I, as the head of the Ashram, am expected to be much more vigilant than anyone of you.
('41', 101, 3, 5, 192466) Mnay of us could not imagine what this would be.
('41', 101, 3, 6, 192515) But he narrated it in vivid and, as he is wont to describe his mistakes, in exaggerated detail.
('41', 101, 3, 7, 192611) Those who have seen Gandhijis room in the Ashram will remember that between the wall which faces the river and the roof there is a piece of lattice work.
('41', 101, 3, 8, 192765) It is meant for ventilation, but it also lets in the suns rays straight on Gandhijis face.
('41', 101, 3, 9, 192856) So he asked one of us to put something there as a screen.
('41', 101, 3, 10, 192914) This friend asked another who immediately brought in the carpenter with a board.
('41', 101, 3, 11, 192995) He naturally thought a shutter would be better than a screen, and asked if Gandhiji would like it.
('41', 101, 3, 12, 193094) Gandhiji agreed, but soon after the carpenter began his work, he seemed to have perceived that he had not done the right thing.
('41', 101, 3, 13, 193222) Now this is not what we who are pledged to poverty may do.
('41', 101, 3, 14, 193281) It ought to have occurred to me that a piece of cardboard or a piece of cloth would serve as well as this shutter which costs a couple of rupees and three hours labour for the carpenter.
('41', 101, 3, 15, 193468) The cardboard or the piece of old cloth would have cost nothing and anyone could have fixed it there with a couple of nails.
('41', 101, 3, 16, 193593) It is in these simple little things that our creed is tested.
('41', 101, 3, 17, 193655) The Kingdom of Heaven is for those who are poor in spirit.
('41', 101, 3, 18, 193714) Let us therefore learn at every step to reduce our needs and wants to the terms of the poor and try to be truly poor in spirit.

('41', 102, 1, 3, 194537) If we do not do so, all our prayers would be like sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
('41', 102, 1, 4, 194624) What a great song was todays!
('41', 102, 1, 5, 194654) Kabir, in his homely telling way, has described the treasures of the humble.
('41', 102, 1, 6, 194731) It is not he that exalteth himself, but he that humbleth himself that shall see God, says Kabir.
('41', 102, 1, 7, 194828) We have to be humble like the ant and not proud like the elephant.

('41', 102, 3, 10, 194947) SABARMATI, [Before January 12, 1928] This talk of passive non resistance has been the bane of our national life.
('41', 102, 3, 11, 195060) Forgiveness is a quality of the soul, and therefore a positive quality.
('41', 102, 3, 12, 195132) It is not negative.
('41', 102, 3, 13, 195152) Conquer anger, says Lord Buddha, by non anger. But what is that non anger?
('41', 102, 3, 14, 195227) It is a positive quality and means the supreme virtue of charity or love.
('41', 102, 3, 15, 195301) You must be roused to this supreme virtue which must express itself in your going to the angry man, ascertaining from him the cause of his anger, making amends if you have given any cause for offence and then bringing home to him the error of his way and convincing him that it is wrong to be provoked.
('41', 102, 3, 16, 195604) This consciousness of the quality of the soul, and deliberate exercise of it, elevate not only the man but the surrounding atmosphere.
('41', 102, 3, 17, 195739) Of course, only he who has that love will exercise it.
('41', 102, 3, 18, 195794) This love can certainly be cultivated by incessant striving.
('41', 102, 3, 19, 195855) Young India, 12 1 1928
('41', 102, 4, 20, 195878) 1 From Mahadev Desais article The Week, which reported the speech under the caption The Essence of Forgiveness.
('41', 102, 4, 21, 195990) It was preceded by the following paragraph: One of the candidates for the Khadi Service went in one day with his own ailment.
('41', 102, 4, 22, 196116) He said he was very much prone to anger and he wanted to cleanse himself with fasting.
('41', 102, 4, 23, 196203) I warn you, said Gandhiji, that fasting is not always a penance for sins.
('41', 102, 4, 24, 196277) Humble surrender to God is the only escape from sin, and all fasting, except when it is undertaken to help that surrender, is useless.
('41', 102, 4, 25, 196412) I would suggest a better remedy.
('41', 102, 4, 26, 196445) Go and apologize to the man you were angry with, ask him to prescribe the penance for you and do that.
('41', 102, 4, 27, 196548) That will be much better expiation than fasting. The friend went and did likewise.
('41', 102, 4, 28, 196631) But what should the man who has been wronged do in this case?
('41', 102, 4, 29, 196693) Simply forgive?
('41', 102, 4, 30, 196709) Forgiveness, we have been told, is the ornament of the brave, but what is that forgiveness?
('41', 102, 4, 31, 196801) Passivity?
('41', 102, 4, 32, 196812) Taking the blow lying down?
('41', 102, 4, 33, 196840) Is that the meaning of not resisting evil?
('41', 102, 4, 34, 196883) This was the subject of a talk one evening and I summarize it briefly :
('41', 103, 0, 1, 196955) 104 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 103, 1, 2, 196997) 125. INDEPENDENCE v.
('41', 103, 2, 3, 197018) It is said that the Independence Resolution is a fitting answer to Lord Birkenhead.
('41', 103, 2, 4, 197102) If this be a serious contention, we have little notion of the answer that we should make to the appointment of the Statutory Commission and the circumstances attending the announcement of the appointment.
('41', 103, 2, 5, 197307) The act of appointment needs, for an answer, not speeches, however heroic they may be, not declarations, however brave they may be, but corresponding action adequate to the act of the British Minister, his colleagues and his followers.
('41', 103, 2, 6, 197543) Supposing the Congress had passed no resolution whatsoever, but had just made a bonfire of every yard of foreign cloth in its possession, and induced a like performance on the part of the whole nation, it would have been some answer, though hardly adequate, to what the act of appointment means.
('41', 103, 2, 7, 197839) If the Congress could have brought about a strike of every Government employee beginning with the Chief Judges and ending with the petty peons, not excluding soldiers, that act would have been a fairly adequate answer.
('41', 103, 2, 8, 198058) It would certainly have disturbed the comfortable equanimity with which the British ministers and those concerned are looking upon all our heroics.
('41', 103, 2, 9, 198206) It may be said this is merely a counsel of perfection which I should know is not capable of execution.
('41', 103, 2, 10, 198309) I do not hold that view.
('41', 103, 2, 11, 198334) Many Indians who are not speaking today are undoubtedly preparing in their own manner for the happy day when every Indian, now sustaining the system of Government which holds the nation in bondage, will leave the denationalizing service.
('41', 103, 2, 12, 198572) It is contended that it is courage, it is undoubtedly wisdom, to restrain the tongue whilst one is unprepared for action.
('41', 103, 2, 13, 198694) Mere brave speech without action is letting off useless steam.
('41', 103, 2, 14, 198757) And the strongest speech shed its bravery when, in 1920, patriots learnt to court imprisonment for strong speeches.
('41', 103, 2, 15, 198873) Speech is necessary for those who are dumbstruck.
('41', 103, 2, 16, 198923) Restraint is necessary for the garrulous.
('41', 103, 2, 17, 198965) The English administrators chaff us for our speech and occasionally betray by their acts their contempt of our speeches and thereby tell us more effecti vely than by words: Act if you dare. Till we can take up the challenge, every single threatening speech or gesture of ours is, in my opinion, a humiliation, and admission of impotence.
('41', 103, 2, 18, 199303) I have seen prisoners in chains spitting forth oaths only to provide mirth for their jailors.
('41', 103, 2, 19, 199397) Moreover, has independence suddenly become a goal in answer
('41', 104, 0, 1, 199457) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 105
('41', 104, 1, 2, 199499) to something offensive that some Englishman has done?
('41', 104, 1, 3, 199553) Do men conceive their goals in order to oblige people or to resent their action?
('41', 104, 1, 4, 199634) I submit that, if it is a goal, it must be declared and pursued irrespective of the acts or threats of others.
('41', 104, 1, 5, 199745) Let us, therefore, understand what we mean by indepen dence.
('41', 104, 1, 6, 199806) England, Russia, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Chile, Bhutan have all their independence.
('41', 104, 1, 7, 199888) Which independence do we want?
('41', 104, 1, 8, 199919) I must not be accused of begging the question.
('41', 104, 1, 9, 199966) For, if I were told that it is Indian independence that is desired, it is possible to show that no two persons will give the same definition.
('41', 104, 1, 10, 200108) The fact of the matter is that we do not know our distant goal.
('41', 104, 1, 11, 200172) It will be determined not by our definitions but by our acts, voluntary and involuntary.
('41', 104, 1, 12, 200261) If we are wise, we will take care of the present and the future will take care of itself.
('41', 104, 1, 13, 200351) God has given us only a limited sphere of action and a limited vision.
('41', 104, 1, 14, 200422) Sufficient unto the day is the good thereof.
('41', 104, 1, 15, 200467) I submit that swaraj is an all satisfying goal for all time.
('41', 104, 1, 16, 200528) We the English educated Indians often unconsciously make the terrible mistake of thinking that the microscopic minority of English speaking Indians is the whole of India.
('41', 104, 1, 17, 200699) I defy anyone to give for independence a common Indian word intelligible to the masses.
('41', 104, 1, 18, 200787) Our goal at any rate may be known by an indigenous word understood of the three hundred millions.
('41', 104, 1, 19, 200885) And we have such a word in swaraj first used in the name of the nation by Dadabhai Naoroji.
('41', 104, 1, 20, 200977) 1 It is infinitely greater than and includes independence.
('41', 104, 1, 21, 201036) It is a vital word.
('41', 104, 1, 22, 201056) It has been sanctified by the noble sacrifices of thousands of Indians.
('41', 104, 1, 23, 201128) It is a word which, if it has not penetrated the remotest corner of India, has at least got the largest currency of any similar word.
('41', 104, 1, 24, 201262) It is a sacrilege to displace that word by a foreign importation of doubtful value.
('41', 104, 1, 25, 201346) This Independence Resolution is perhaps the final reason for conducting Congress proceedings in Hindustani and that alone.
('41', 104, 1, 26, 201469) No tragedy like that of the Independence Resolution would then have been possible.
('41', 104, 1, 27, 201552) The most valiant speakers would then have ornamented the native meaning of the word swaraj and attempted all kinds of definitions, glorious and inglorious.
('41', 104, 1, 28, 201708) Would that the independents would profit by their experience and resolve henceforth to work among the masses for whom they desire freedom and taboo English speech in its entirety in so far as mass meetings such as the Congress are concerned.
('41', 104, 2, 29, 201950) 1 In his presidential address at the Calcutta Congress in 1906, Dadabhai Naoroji used the word swaraj as a synonym for self government.
('41', 105, 0, 1, 202086) 106 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 105, 1, 2, 202128) Personally, I crave not for independence, which I do not understand, but I long for freedom from the English yoke.
('41', 105, 1, 3, 202243) I would pay any price for it.
('41', 105, 1, 4, 202273) I would accept chaos in exchange for it.
('41', 105, 1, 5, 202314) For the English peace is the peace of the grave.
('41', 105, 1, 6, 202363) Anything would be better than this living death of a whole people.
('41', 105, 1, 7, 202430) This Satanic has well nigh ruined this fair land materially, morally and spiritually.
('41', 105, 1, 8, 202516) I daily see its law courts denying justice and murdering truth.
('41', 105, 1, 9, 202580) I have just come from terrorized Orissa.
('41', 105, 1, 10, 202621) This rule is using my own countrymen for its sinful sustenance.
('41', 105, 1, 11, 202685) I have a number of affidavits swearing that, in the district of Khurda, acknowledgments of enhancement of revenue are being forced from the people practically at the point of the bayonet.
('41', 105, 1, 12, 202873) The unparalleled extravagance of this rule has demented the Rajas and the Maharajas who, unmindful of consequences, ape it and grind their subjects to dust.
('41', 105, 1, 13, 203030) In order to protect its immoral commerce, this rule regards no means too mean, and in order to keep three hundred millions under the heels of a hundred thousand, it carries a military expenditure which is keeping millions in a state of semi starvation and polluting thousands of mouths with intoxicating liquor.
('41', 105, 1, 14, 203342) But my creed is non violence under all circumstances.
('41', 105, 1, 15, 203396) My method is conversion, not coercion; it is self suffering, not the suffering of the tyrant.
('41', 105, 1, 16, 203490) I know that method to be infallible.
('41', 105, 1, 17, 203527) I know that a whole people can adopt it without accepting it as its creed and without understanding its philosophy.
('41', 105, 1, 18, 203643) People generally do not understand the philosophy of all their acts.
('41', 105, 1, 19, 203712) My ambition is much higher than independence.
('41', 105, 1, 20, 203758) Through the deliverance of India, I seek to deliver the so called weaker races of the earth from the crushing heels of Western exploitation in which England is the greatest partner.
('41', 105, 1, 21, 203940) If India converts, as it can convert, Englishmen, it can become the predominant partner in a world commonwealth of which England can have the privilege of becoming a partner if she chooses.
('41', 105, 1, 22, 204130) India has the right, if she only knew, of becoming the predominant partner by reason of her numbers, geographical position and culture inherited for ages.
('41', 105, 1, 23, 204285) This is big talk, I know.
('41', 105, 1, 24, 204311) For a fallen India to aspire to move the world and protect weaker races is seemingly an impertinence.
('41', 105, 1, 25, 204413) But in explaining my strong opposition to this cry for independence, I can no longer hide the light under a bushel.
('41', 105, 1, 26, 204529) Mine is an ambition worth living for and worth dying for.
('41', 105, 1, 27, 204587) In no case do I want to reconcile myself to a state lower than the best for fear of consequences.
('41', 105, 1, 28, 204685) It is, therefore, not out of expedience that I oppose independence as my goal.
('41', 105, 1, 29, 204764) I want India to come to her own and that state cannot be better

('41', 106, 1, 2, 204870) defined by any single word than swaraj.
('41', 106, 1, 3, 204910) Its content will vary with the action that the nation is able to put forth at a given moment.
('41', 106, 1, 4, 205004) Indias coming to her own will mean every nation doing likewise.

('41', 106, 3, 7, 205145) I am enclosing herewith a cutting from the Sind Observer of Karachi wherein you will find your name among others used in support of medicines sought to be popularized and sold through the medium of such advertisements.
('41', 106, 4, 8, 205364) I can hardly believe you could have spoken or written appreciatively of the medicines, mixtures, pills or potions of the pharmacy in question.
('41', 106, 5, 9, 205507) I hope you would write in Young India about this matter.
('41', 106, 5, 10, 205564) I have seen the advertisement too.
('41', 106, 5, 11, 205599) It is taking an unlawful liberty with my name and, I doubt not, the names of other leaders.
('41', 106, 5, 12, 205691) It is remarkable the freedom these pharmacies take in order to find custom for their wretched traffic.
('41', 106, 5, 13, 205794) In my opinion this use of names of persons without their permission is an illegality punishable in law.
('41', 106, 5, 14, 205898) Since, as a non co operator, I may not seek the protection of the law, I must be satisfied with warning the public against being misled by the use of my name in connection with any drug whatsoever.
('41', 106, 5, 15, 206096) My disbelief in drugs in general is as strong as ever notwithstanding the very limited use by me in recent times of one or two comparatively harmless and well known opening drugs and quinine.
('41', 106, 5, 16, 206288) I have no desire to see pharmacies multiplied in this country, I would rather see people freed from the slavery of drugs.

('41', 106, 6, 18, 206433) 127. MADRAS KHADI EXHIBITION
('41', 106, 7, 19, 206462) Mr. Polak being in Madras during the Congress Week, I invited him to visit the Khadi Exhibition and give me his criticism.
('41', 106, 7, 20, 206585) He has now sent me a letter from which I take the following extract 1 : Though the criticism is not a considered opinion it will be useful to the organizers of future exhibitions.
('41', 106, 7, 21, 206765) I do not share the view that educated Indians will not patronize khadi unless they have it supplied
('41', 106, 8, 22, 206865) 1 Not reproduced here.
('41', 106, 8, 23, 206888) Polak had criticized the Exhibition for the bad site and defective arrangements.

('41', 107, 1, 3, 207098) Whilst they do expect a particular standard to satisfy their artistic taste, they are gladly paying extra cost, and are by no means insistent on equality with machine made cloth in point of quality.
('41', 107, 1, 4, 207297) The knowledge that khadi supports the poorest of the land who would otherwise be without such support is a great determining factor with the educated and well to do classes in buying khadi.
('41', 107, 1, 5, 207487) But that of course is no reason for khadi producers to be remiss in their attempt to improve the quality.
('41', 107, 1, 6, 207593) Indeed the advance made in this direction is highly encouraging.
('41', 107, 1, 7, 207658) The workers are not going to be contented with anything less than the excellence that khadi had when there was no machine made cloth and which no machine has been yet able even to equal.

('41', 107, 2, 10, 207992) The one that follows has like all his stories a moral behind it.
('41', 107, 2, 11, 208057) This one is an untouchable story 1. May it melt some stony touchable heart!

('41', 107, 4, 14, 208193) The Mysore Government have taken up an experiment in khadi production and have started work in real earnest at a centre called Badanval, taking advantage of help from the A.I.S.A. in regard to workers and plan of work.
('41', 107, 4, 15, 208412) Rajagopalachari has received a letter from one of the workers from which the following interesting account of progress of work is extracted.
('41', 107, 4, 16, 208553) 2 It shows how easily khadi spreads if the work is started on right lines in rural areas where the need for a supplementary occupation is keenly felt.

('41', 108, 3, 4, 208913) RESPECTED SISTER,
('41', 108, 4, 5, 208931) You must have heard about the three day convention of the International Fellowship 1 we are going to hold here.
('41', 108, 4, 6, 209043) We shall be grateful if you can make available your Ford car on the 13th, 14th and 15th.
('41', 108, 4, 7, 209132) It should remain with us for the whole day.
('41', 108, 4, 8, 209176) It will be a convenience if the guests want to go some where .
('41', 108, 5, 9, 209239) Bapuji has further suggested that Ambalalbhai and you should invite the guests for tea on the last day, that is, Sunday, in the evening at 3.30 or 4, or later at 7.30 or 8. I am enclosing the list of all the members.
('41', 108, 5, 10, 209456) You may come here tomorrow or the day after and meet them and personally invite the Secretary of the convention, Mr. Paul 2. But Bapu feels it would be nice if you could meet all of them and on the occasion of their visit invite a few of your friends in Ahmedabad.
('41', 108, 6, 11, 209721) Do send a reply.

('41', 108, 10, 15, 209872) SATYAGRAHASHRAM, SABARMATI, Thursday, January 12, 1928
('41', 108, 11, 16, 209927) DEAR BROTHER, Seeing your letter I should neither answer it nor go there.
('41', 108, 11, 17, 210001) But I cannot help replying.
('41', 108, 11, 18, 210029) We are both stubborn.
('41', 108, 11, 19, 210051) We would both consider each other obstinate.
('41', 108, 11, 20, 210096) Your obstinacy lies in writing to Gujaratis in English.
('41', 108, 11, 21, 210152) I am obstinate in writing to Gujaratis in Gujarati.

('41', 109, 1, 3, 210620) I would certainly like to come to your place on Sunday.
('41', 109, 1, 4, 210676) I am sure I am still the same as I was in 1915. Even then, though I used to be hard pressed for time, people dear to me did take my time by stealing or snatching it, and I let them do so.
('41', 109, 1, 5, 210864) Even today they have not abandoned their ways and I am not able to go against them.
('41', 109, 1, 6, 210948) What else can a non violent man do?
('41', 109, 1, 7, 210984) Hence, even though, mercifully, there is no illness in your family and even though to a Mahatma an occasion like Saraladevis birthday is of no importance, I would come if I could manage it.
('41', 109, 1, 8, 211174) I do not know what I would be having to eat, though I would certainly lose some time.
('41', 109, 1, 9, 211260) But I am really sorry.
('41', 109, 1, 10, 211283) Some twenty men and women belonging to the International Fellowship are starting their work in the Ashram from tomorrow.
('41', 109, 1, 11, 211404) Sunday is the last day for them.
('41', 109, 1, 12, 211437) So as soon as I return from my visit to the Vidyapith, I have to present myself among them.
('41', 109, 1, 13, 211529) What can I do now?
('41', 109, 1, 14, 211548) I have suggested that you should invite all of them one evening and call a few friends.
('41', 109, 2, 15, 211636) Surely, I can take that much liberty with you?
('41', 109, 2, 16, 211683) But if this is in convenient I would not wish you to do it.
('41', 109, 2, 17, 211743) The letter about your small car was also being despatched, but your letter came in the meantime and so I am sending that letter along too.
('41', 109, 2, 18, 211882) You are free to take my time whenever you wish.
('41', 109, 2, 19, 211930) Please do so.
('41', 109, 2, 20, 211944) Surely you do not think me such a fool as not to understand the affection dripping through your letter?

('41', 109, 7, 25, 212215) MANILAL AND SUSHILA, I got your letters.
('41', 109, 7, 26, 212256) Only today I had a letter from Akola which gives the news of Sushilas miscarriage.
('41', 109, 7, 27, 212339) Manilal has written neither to Ba nor me about it.
('41', 109, 7, 28, 212390) There should be no shyness or hesitation in writing to me about such matters.
('41', 109, 7, 29, 212468) It will not help you to keep back such things from me
('41', 109, 8, 30, 212522) 1Vide the preceding item.

('41', 110, 1, 2, 212720) because of my views about them.
('41', 110, 1, 3, 212752) In any case, I would come to know about the thing indirectly.
('41', 110, 1, 4, 212814) I might feel hurt for a moment.
('41', 110, 1, 5, 212846) People may hold the same views as I do about this matter and yet not be able to refrain from indulgence.
('41', 110, 1, 6, 212951) If they could, would they ever marry?
('41', 110, 1, 7, 212989) The wish to marry comes from the desire for self gratification.
('41', 110, 1, 8, 213053) Our rishis, however, tried to make marriage a means of learning self restraint, or say that regulated through marriage a relationship which was unregulated.
('41', 110, 1, 9, 213210) But man is more inclined towards self gratification and he turned marriage also into another means of self gratification.
('41', 110, 1, 10, 213332) However, from a couple like you I can expect nothing more than that you should remain vigilant and constantly strive for self control.
('41', 110, 1, 11, 213467) There is, therefore, no need for you to keep me ignorant about the fruits of marriage.
('41', 110, 1, 12, 213554) Sushila must be better now.
('41', 110, 1, 13, 213582) If after a miscarriage proper treatment is taken, its harmful effects can be controlled.
('41', 110, 1, 14, 213671) You may trust me that one such treatment, and a very effective one, is the Kuhne Bath.
('41', 110, 1, 15, 213758) It removes the cause of miscarriage and makes future deliveries easier and less painful.
('41', 110, 1, 16, 213847) Sushila should have plain food and regular sleep, and should keep away from things that excite the body.
('41', 110, 1, 17, 213952) I should like both of you to read Kuhnes book, as also Justes.
('41', 110, 1, 18, 214015) Dr. John Nicholsons book, too, is worth reading.
('41', 110, 1, 19, 214064) The Ashram has started filling up and in two days it will be full.
('41', 110, 1, 20, 214131) Nearly thirty persons are coming.
('41', 110, 1, 21, 214165) Among them there will be twelve to fifteen Europeans too.
('41', 110, 1, 22, 214223) Ramdas arrived today.
('41', 110, 1, 23, 214245) Rami, Manu came yesterday.
('41', 110, 1, 24, 214272) Devdas is still in Bombay taking treatment for one of his bones.
('41', 110, 1, 25, 214337) I do not know why you did not get the chapters of the Gita.
('41', 110, 1, 26, 214397) I have finished the translation.
('41', 110, 1, 27, 214430) I will tell Mahadev.

('41', 111, 1, 2, 214557) 133. DISCUSSION ON FELLOWSHIP 1
('41', 111, 2, 3, 214589) [Before January 15, 1928] In order to attain a perfect fellowship, every act of its members must be a religious act and an act of sacrifice.
('41', 111, 2, 4, 214730) I came to the conclusion long ago, after prayerful search and study and discussion with as many people as I could meet, that all religions were true and also that all had some error in them, and that whilst I hold by my own, I should hold others as dear as Hinduism, from which it logically follows that we should hold all as dear as our nearest kith and kin and that we should make no distinction between them.
('41', 111, 2, 5, 215142) So we can only pray, if we are Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu, or if we are mussalmans, not that a Hindu or a Christian should become a Mussalman, nor should we even secretly pray that anyone should be converted, but our inmost prayer should be that a Hindu should be a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim and a Christian a better Christian.
('41', 111, 2, 6, 215507) That is the fundamental truth of fellowship.
('41', 111, 2, 7, 215552) That is the meaning of the wonderful passion, the story of which Andrews read out to you, of the song and verses that Khare, Shastri and Imam Saheb recited.
('41', 111, 2, 8, 215709) If Andrews invited them to give their song and verses for mere courtesy or by way of patronizing toleration, he was false to the fellowship.
('41', 111, 2, 9, 215850) In that case, he should not have done so, but I have known Charlie Andrews too well, and I know that he has given the same love to others as he has for his own, and thereby broadened his Christianity, as I broaden my Hinduism by loving other religions as my own.
('41', 111, 2, 10, 216113) If however there is any suspicion in your minds that only one religion can be true and others false, you must reject the doctrine of fellowship placed before you.
('41', 111, 2, 11, 216276) Then we would have a continuous process of exclusion and found our fellowship on an exclusive basis.
('41', 111, 3, 12, 216377) 1 Members of the Council of International Federation and their friends stayed in the Ashram and held discussions on the fundamental objective of the fellowship.
('41', 111, 3, 13, 216538) Mahadev Desai in his article The Week under the caption The Foundation of Fellowship records: The discussion lasted for two days .
('41', 111, 3, 14, 216669) It led to a free and frank exchange of views ultimately bound to establish a better understanding.
('41', 111, 3, 15, 216768) There was no difference of opinion as to the object of all to work for the widest toleration, to combine and side with the forces of light against the forces of darkness, or as Deenabandhu Andrews said, those who blankly leave God out and become materialists.
('41', 111, 3, 16, 217028) Everyone seemed to be agreed on this, but many seemed to run away from what would appear to be the necessary corollary of the proposition.
('41', 111, 3, 17, 217167) This was defined by Gandhiji at some length at this and other meetings.
('41', 112, 0, 1, 217239) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 113
('41', 112, 1, 2, 217281) Above all I plead for utter truthfulness.
('41', 112, 1, 3, 217323) If we do not feel for other religions as we feel for our own, we had better disband ourselves, for we do not want a wishy washy toleration.
('41', 112, 1, 4, 217463) My doctrine of toleration does not include toleration of evil, though it does the toleration of the evil minded.
('41', 112, 1, 5, 217576) It does not therefore mean that you have to invite each and every one who is evil minded or tolerate a false faith.
('41', 112, 1, 6, 217692) By a true faith I mean one the sum total of whose energy is for the good of its adherents, by a false I mean that which is predominantly false.
('41', 112, 1, 7, 217836) If you, therefore, feel that the sum total of Hinduism has been bad for the Hindus and the world, you must reject it as a false faith.
('41', 112, 2, 8, 217971) Gandhijis insistence on a member of the fellowship not even secretly wishing that a member of another faith should be converted to his own led to a general discussion on the question of conversion.
('41', 112, 2, 9, 218169) Gandhiji again defined his position more clearly than before : I would not only not try to convert but would not even secretly pray that anyone should embrace my faith.
('41', 112, 2, 10, 218338) My prayer would always be that Imam Saheb should be a better Mussalman, or become the best he can.
('41', 112, 2, 11, 218437) Hinduism with its message of ahimsa is to me the most glorious religion in the worldas my wife to me is the most beautiful woman in the worldbut others may feel the same about their own religion.
('41', 112, 2, 12, 218633) Cases of real honest conversion are quite possible.
('41', 112, 2, 13, 218685) If some people for their inward satisfaction and growth change their religion, let them do so.
('41', 112, 2, 14, 218780) As regards taking our message to the aborigines, I do not think I should go and give my message out of my own wisdom.
('41', 112, 2, 15, 218898) Do it in all humility, it is said.
('41', 112, 2, 16, 218933) Well, I have been an unfortunate witness of arrogance often going in the garb of humility.
('41', 112, 2, 17, 219024) If I am perfect, I know that my thought will reach others.
('41', 112, 2, 18, 219083) It taxes all my time to reach the goal I have set to myself.
('41', 112, 2, 19, 219144) What have I to take to the aborigines and the Assamese hillmen except to go in my nakedness to them?
('41', 112, 2, 20, 219245) Rather than ask them to join my prayer, I would join their prayer.
('41', 112, 2, 21, 219312) We were strangers to this sort of classificationanimists, aborigines, etc.,but we have learnt it from English rulers.
('41', 112, 2, 22, 219430) I must have the desire to serve and it must put me right with people.
('41', 112, 2, 23, 219500) Conversion and service go ill together.
('41', 112, 3, 24, 219540) The next day early morning the friends met for an an informal conversation with Gandhiji when again the same question was asked by many of them.
('41', 112, 3, 25, 219685) Would you have a ruling of such a character that those who had a desire to convert should not be eligible for membership? Personally, I think they should not be eligible.
('41', 112, 3, 26, 219856) I should have framed a resolution to that effect as I regard it as the logical outcome
('41', 113, 0, 1, 219943) 114 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 113, 1, 2, 219985) of fellowship.
('41', 113, 1, 3, 220000) It is essential for inter religious relationship and contact.
('41', 113, 2, 4, 220062) Is not the impulse to proselytize God given?, inquired another friend.
('41', 113, 2, 5, 220133) I question it.
('41', 113, 2, 6, 220148) But if all impulses are God given, as some of our Hindus believe, He has also given us discrimination.
('41', 113, 2, 7, 220251) He will say, I have given you many impulses so that your capacity to face temptation may be tested.
('41', 113, 3, 8, 220351) But you do believe in preaching an economic order?, inquired one of the fair sex.
('41', 113, 3, 9, 220433) I do, as I believe in preaching laws of health.
('41', 113, 4, 10, 220481) Then why not apply the same rule in religious matters?
('41', 113, 4, 11, 220536) It is a relevant question.
('41', 113, 4, 12, 220563) But you must not forget that we have started with the fundamental principle that all religions are true.
('41', 113, 4, 13, 220668) If there were different but good and true health laws for different communities, I should hesitate to preach some as true and some as false.
('41', 113, 4, 14, 220809) I am positive that, with people not prepared to tolerate one anothers religious belief, there can be no international fellowship.
('41', 113, 4, 15, 220939) Moreover, physical analogies when applied to spiritual matters are good only up to a certain point.
('41', 113, 4, 16, 221039) When you take up an analogy from Nature, you can stretch it only to a certain point.
('41', 113, 4, 17, 221124) But I would take an illustration from the physical world and explain what I mean.
('41', 113, 4, 18, 221206) If I want to hand a rose to you, there is definite movement.
('41', 113, 4, 19, 221267) But if I want to transmit its scent, I do so without any movement.
('41', 113, 4, 20, 221334) The rose transmits its own scent without a movement.
('41', 113, 4, 21, 221387) Let us rise a step higher, and we can understand that spiritual experiences are self acting.
('41', 113, 4, 22, 221480) Therefore, the analogy of preaching sanitation, etc., does not hold good.
('41', 113, 4, 23, 221554) If we have spiritual truth, it will transmit itself.
('41', 113, 4, 24, 221607) You talk of the joy of a spiritual experience and say you cannot but share it.
('41', 113, 4, 25, 221686) Well, if it is real joy, boundless joy, it will spread itself without the vehicle of speech.
('41', 113, 4, 26, 221779) In spiritual matters we have merely to step out of the way.
('41', 113, 4, 27, 221839) Let God work His way.
('41', 113, 4, 28, 221861) If we interfere, we may do harm.
('41', 113, 4, 29, 221894) Good is a self acting force.
('41', 113, 4, 30, 221923) Evil is not, because it is negative force.
('41', 113, 4, 31, 221966) It requires the cloak of virtue before it can march forward.
('41', 113, 5, 32, 222027) Did not Jesus Himself teach and preach?
('41', 113, 5, 33, 222067) We are on dangerous ground here.
('41', 113, 5, 34, 222100) You ask me to give any interpretation of the life of Christ.
('41', 113, 5, 35, 222161) Well, I may say that I do not accept

('41', 114, 1, 3, 222287) And it must be remembered that he was working amongst his own people, and said he had not come to destroy but to fulfil.
('41', 114, 1, 4, 222408) I draw a great distinction between the Sermon on the Mount and the Letters of Paul.
('41', 114, 1, 5, 222492) They are a graft on Christs teaching, his own gloss apart from Christs own experience.

('41', 115, 3, 7, 223634) I understand that he will have to undergo another operation of a far more serious nature and might have to stay in India for may more months.
('41', 115, 3, 8, 223776) I understand too that he has come with an understanding with the A.I.C.C. arrived at by Father that his passage to and fro should be paid by the Congress.
('41', 115, 3, 9, 223931) If that is so, I suppose we should defray his hosptial expenses also and perhaps these in any case seeing that he was coming to the Congress.
('41', 115, 3, 10, 224073) I understand that he will be soon in arrears about his hospital charges.
('41', 115, 3, 11, 224146) Will you please inquire and do the needful, even set the wire in motion if necessary.
('41', 115, 3, 12, 224232) I understand that the Madras Comittee has already paid nearly Rs. 400. The hospital charges alone are said to amount to Rs. 12 per day.

('41', 116, 1, 4, 224958) What you now say about Monmohan Babu certainly makes me sad.
('41', 116, 1, 5, 225019) Dr. Ray has sent me two letters.
('41', 116, 1, 6, 225052) In the first he refers to khadi admiringly and in the second he declares his firm faith in it and looks forward to Jamnalaljis visit.
('41', 116, 1, 7, 225186) If I can, I shall send you copies of the letters.
('41', 116, 1, 8, 225236) I am glad Hemaprabha Devi is cheerful now.
('41', 116, 1, 9, 225279) It is strange Tarini should still be unwell.
('41', 116, 1, 10, 225324) Can he not conduct his researches in a better climate?
('41', 116, 1, 11, 225379) With love,

('41', 116, 4, 13, 225418) 137. SPEECH AT CONVOCATION OF GUJARAT VIDYAPITH January 15, 1928 Deenabandhu Andrews 1 is not only a good Englishman who has sacrificed everything for this country; he is also an artist, poet and fluent orator.
('41', 116, 4, 14, 225629) Those who have studied his speeches and his deeds can realize that there is art in whatever he does.
('41', 116, 4, 15, 225730) He is a poet because he understands what the future should be and what it may be.
('41', 116, 4, 16, 225812) He is a fluent orator, not because he can speak volubly or because his style and pronunciation are excellent, but because all his words flow from his heart.
('41', 116, 4, 17, 225969) One may form a certain impression on reading his speeches, but they must have made a different impression on his immediate listeners.
('41', 116, 4, 18, 226103) Ordinarily we take it that one who can speak continuously for hours together is a fluent orator.
('41', 116, 4, 19, 226200) Some may think that Mr. Andrews read out a written speech because he could not speak extempore.
('41', 116, 4, 20, 226296) But it would be foolish to think so.
('41', 116, 4, 21, 226333) He made his written speech so interesting that we got completely engrossed in it.
('41', 116, 4, 22, 226415) It was so absorbingly interesting because his speech came straight from his heart.
('41', 116, 4, 23, 226498) He referred in his speech to the late Hakim Saheb.
('41', 116, 4, 24, 226549) On a superficial view one may wonder what a convocation address has to do with the death of Hakim Saheb; reference to it would show a lack of artistic sense!
('41', 116, 4, 25, 226707) I feel that in this very thing he has revealed his artistic skill and has achieved his aim.
('41', 116, 4, 26, 226799) Andrews is quite old compared to you.
('41', 116, 5, 27, 226837) 1 C. F. Andrews delivered the convocation address.
('41', 117, 0, 1, 226888) 118 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 117, 1, 2, 226930) He talked about his childhood.
('41', 117, 1, 3, 226961) He spoke of the beginning of his training under Hakim Saheb.
('41', 117, 1, 4, 227022) Hakim Saheb had become a well known physician, and used to serve the rich and the poor through his knowledge of medicine; then it was that Andrews realized that he was taking training from him.
('41', 117, 1, 5, 227216) He spoke from his own experience and said that he did not remember the lectures deli vered by his teachers, but the greatest and the holiest thing he remem bered was how one his teachers whose memory he cherished was able to penetrate his heart.
('41', 117, 1, 6, 227462) It was to show this very purpose of education that he narrated the story of Hakim Ajmal Khan.
('41', 117, 1, 7, 227556) Therein lies wonderful art.
('41', 117, 1, 8, 227584) Compassion is certainly there in it.
('41', 117, 1, 9, 227621) And while reading his speech he made us taste the sentiment of courage and in the end taught self sacrifice.
('41', 117, 1, 10, 227730) Moreover, he narrated the story of his own life.
('41', 117, 1, 11, 227779) Our hearts have sunk into the valoe of despondency and though at present we have these buildings we apprehend that perhaps two years hence only pigeons might haunt them.
('41', 117, 1, 12, 227949) He understands this feeling of anxiety.
('41', 117, 1, 13, 227989) I have not told him about this, but he is able to smell it in the air around us.
('41', 117, 1, 14, 228070) Therefore he said to you, You have buildings, money and land; you will go on receiving money in a province like Gujarat.
('41', 117, 1, 15, 228191) But if I tell the origin of the college in which I had studied, you will be surprised and you will see a ray of hope, because it was started in a mere small cottage and that too by a brave widow, who had lost her husband on the very day of her marriage.
('41', 117, 1, 16, 228445) She could have remarried, but she dedicated herself to the religion of service.
('41', 117, 1, 17, 228525) She found out saints and sadhus and asked them to give education to students; she had huts built for them to stay in.
('41', 117, 1, 18, 228643) From those very huts developed the present great Pembroke College which gave us poets like Spenser and Gray, outstanding statement like Pitt and philosophers like Browne. He has tried to comfort you by saying that his own college and your college have had a similar history, that if you work in patience your college too can produce great men.
('41', 117, 1, 19, 228987) And the remedy that he has suggested is self confidence.
('41', 117, 1, 20, 229044) It is born of faith in God and patience.
('41', 117, 1, 21, 229085) The finest things cannot be produced all at once.
('41', 117, 1, 22, 229135) The seed tree remains hidden in the ground and a big strong tree takes long years to grow.
('41', 117, 1, 23, 229226) But the gardener knows that the tree will take its own time to grow, that he has to let the grass grow on the ground.
('41', 117, 1, 24, 229344) The gardener does not get disheartened, because he knows.
('41', 117, 1, 25, 229402) Andrews does not expect such knowledge from us, but he expects faith.
('41', 117, 1, 26, 229472) He placed before us the definition of faith in the Bible, faith is the evidence of things not seen.
('41', 117, 1, 27, 229572) If you have such faith, then the Vidyapith will never collapse.
('41', 118, 0, 1, 229636) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 119
('41', 118, 1, 2, 229678) Vidyapith has not taken as many years to grow as Pembroke.
('41', 118, 1, 3, 229737) You may well say: Here is our achievement; fifteen kumar mandirs 1 have been disaffiliated!
('41', 118, 1, 4, 229829) And that some more may yet be disaffiliated!
('41', 118, 1, 5, 229874) But if you have faith you will not be disheartened.
('41', 118, 1, 6, 229926) The kumar mandirs had to be disaffiliated because we would not bend, we insisted on our conditions and said: If you wish the affiliation to continue, the students must spin; otherwise it will be terminated. A day may come when no one would stay here; only the chancellor would be sitting, he would be the teacher and the student; a spinning wheel would be in front of him; then he may have a visitor; but if noone comes, monkeys at any rate would come and if he has faith he would speak to them like Vaidarbhi 2 and find comfort.
('41', 118, 1, 7, 230456) What is the evidence of my faith?
('41', 118, 1, 8, 230490) The only evidence is that it does exist.
('41', 118, 1, 9, 230531) If anyone asks you then you may refer him to the one who is never tired of speaking about the spinning wheel.
('41', 118, 1, 10, 230641) If you have that much faith, then according to Andrews you can create not one but a thousand Pembrokes here.
('41', 118, 1, 11, 230750) How can you compare England with India, a country which can hold many Englands within it?
('41', 118, 1, 12, 230840) But do we have such courage?
('41', 118, 1, 13, 230869) Do we have such patience?
('41', 118, 1, 14, 230895) Without courage and patience, faith cannot be fruitful.
('41', 118, 1, 15, 230951) We must always adhere to our principles and have confidence.
('41', 118, 1, 16, 231012) We do not wish to behave like a deceitful businessman.
('41', 118, 1, 17, 231067) He fixes the price and prepares the packets after seeing the customer.
('41', 118, 1, 18, 231138) If we yield this much, then students will come; let us then be that much lenient.
('41', 118, 1, 19, 231220) This kind of business will benefit neither the public nor the Vidyapith.
('41', 118, 1, 20, 231293) If the teachers have faith, then they will speak with one voice.
('41', 118, 1, 21, 231358) Even the student will chime in and say: What does it matter even if I am left alone, the teachers will pass on to me everything that they have.
('41', 118, 1, 22, 231502) God is one, but in His creation there is infinite variety. Thus, if one student, though all alone, clutivates fearlessness, there will be a hundred to follow him.
('41', 118, 1, 23, 231665) That is the substance of Andrewss speech, the burden of his song.
('41', 118, 1, 24, 231731) You may take his speech as mine.
('41', 118, 1, 25, 231764) Be proud of your college, cherish the Vidyapith and enlighten you life.
('41', 118, 1, 26, 231836) Wherever you may be, remember the Vidyapith.
('41', 118, 1, 27, 231881) Soon you will know what turn it will take in the future, but I want you to wait with faith and patience and I promise you that, so long as any one of us is alive, we will not let the Vidyapith close down.
('41', 118, 1, 28, 232086) I am ready to die, to be buried alive, if the Vidyapith

('41', 119, 1, 2, 232250) If you can bear the austerities of the Vidyapith, then rest assured that it will always offer a shelter for you; but if you cannot, do not blame me or the teacher but blame your fate.
('41', 119, 1, 3, 232434) But if we fail to fulfil our pledge, then I must tell you that, although we are wedded to non violence, you have the right to kill us.

('41', 119, 6, 10, 233076) MY DEAR JAWAHARLAL, I must dictate and save time and give rest to my aching shoulder.
('41', 119, 6, 11, 233162) I wrote to you on Sunday about Fenner Brockway.
('41', 119, 6, 12, 233210) 3 I hope you got that letter in due time.
('41', 119, 6, 13, 233252) Do you know that it was because you were the chief partner in the transactions referred to that I wrote the articles 4 you have criticized, except of course about the so called All India Exhibition?
('41', 119, 6, 14, 233451) I felt a kind of safety that, in view of the relations between you and me, my writings would be taken in the spirit in which

('41', 120, 1, 2, 233871) they were written.
('41', 120, 1, 3, 233890) However, I see that they were a misfire all round.
('41', 120, 1, 4, 233941) I do not mind it.
('41', 120, 1, 5, 233959) For, it is evident that the articles alone could deliver you from the self suppression under which you have been labouring apparently for so many years.
('41', 120, 1, 6, 234112) Though I was beginning to detect some differences in viewpoint between you and me, I had no notion whatsoever of the terrible extent of these differences.
('41', 120, 1, 7, 234267) Whilst you were heroically suppressing yourself for the sake of the nation and in the belife that by working with and under me in spite of yourself, you would serve the nation and come out scatheless, you were chafing under the burden of this unnatural self suppression.
('41', 120, 1, 8, 234538) And, while you were in that state, you overlooked the very things which appear to you now as my serious blemishes.
('41', 120, 1, 9, 234653) I could show you from the pages of Young India equally strong articles written by me, when I was actively guiding the Congress with reference to the doing of the All India Congress Committee.
('41', 120, 1, 10, 234845) I have spoken similarly at the All India Congress Committee meetings whenever there has been irresponsible and hasty talk or action.
('41', 120, 1, 11, 234978) But whilst you were under stupefaction these things did not jar on you as they do now.
('41', 120, 1, 12, 235065) And it seems to me, therefore, useless to show you the discrepancies in your letter.
('41', 120, 1, 13, 235150) What I am now concerned with is future action.
('41', 120, 1, 14, 235197) If any freedom is required from me, I give you all the freedom you may need from the humble, unquestioning allegiance that you have given to me for all these years and which I value all the more for the knowledge I have now gained of your state.
('41', 120, 1, 15, 235443) I see quite clearly that you must carry on open warfare against me and my views.
('41', 120, 1, 16, 235524) For, if I am wrong I am evidently doing irreparable harm to the country and it is your duty after having known it to rise in revolt against me.
('41', 120, 1, 17, 235668) Or, if you have any doubt as to the correctness of your conclusion, I shall gladly discuss them with you personally.
('41', 120, 1, 18, 235785) The differences between you and me appear to me to be so vast and radical that there seems to be no meeting ground between us.
('41', 120, 1, 19, 235912) I cant conceal from you my grief that I should lose a comrade so valiant, so faithful, so able and so honest as you have always been; but in serving a cause, comradeships have got to be sacrificed.
('41', 120, 1, 20, 236110) The cause must be held superior to all such considerations.
('41', 120, 1, 21, 236170) But this dissolution of comradeshipif dissolution must comein no way affects our personal intimacy.
('41', 120, 1, 22, 236270) We have long become members of the same family, and we remain such in spite of grave political differences.
('41', 120, 1, 23, 236378) I have the good fortune to enjoy such relations with several people.
('41', 120, 1, 24, 236447) To take Sastri for instance, he and I differ in the political outlook as poles as under, but the bond between

('41', 121, 1, 2, 236599) him and me that sprung up before we knew the political differences has persisted and survived the fiery ordeals it had to go through.
('41', 121, 1, 3, 236733) I suggest a dignified way of unfurling your banner.
('41', 121, 1, 4, 236785) Write to me a letter for publication showing your differences.
('41', 121, 1, 5, 236848) I will print it in Young India and write a brief reply.
('41', 121, 1, 6, 236904) Your first letter I destroyed after reading and replying to it, the second I am keeping, and if you do not want to take the trouble of writing another letter, I am prepared to publish the letter that is before me.
('41', 121, 1, 7, 237118) I am not aware of any offensive passage in it.
('41', 121, 1, 8, 237165) But if I find any, you may depend upon my removing every such passage.
('41', 121, 1, 9, 237236) I consider that letter to be a frank and honest document.

('41', 121, 5, 13, 237403) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, January 17, 1928
('41', 121, 6, 14, 237443) DEAR FRIEND, Your letter is proof of the fact that a leopard cannot change his spots.
('41', 121, 6, 15, 237529) I detected in it the old Collector parrying blows and making out a plausible case out of indifferent material.
('41', 121, 6, 16, 237640) Let me take an analogy.
('41', 121, 6, 17, 237664) The floor space that the English rulers occupy in India is infinitesimal, their numbers still more infinitesimal compared to the teeming millions.
('41', 121, 6, 18, 237811) There are more natives in the Government employ than Englishmen.
('41', 121, 6, 19, 237876) According to your reasoning, Englishmen will be able to call their rule therefore swadeshi rule.
('41', 121, 6, 20, 237973) And yet you and I would repudiate any such preposterous claim.
('41', 121, 6, 21, 238036) And it was certainly very clever of you to have 62 thousand square feet allotted to khadi part of the indigenous thing.
('41', 121, 6, 22, 238156) Whilst I was glad that khadi was outside the elephantine court, it was disgraceful if what I was told by reliable men was true, namely, that the Government had stipulated that khadi should be outside that court.
('41', 121, 6, 23, 238368) And, is it proper for you to say that I permitted the exhibition of foreign textiles?
('41', 121, 6, 24, 238454) Do you not recall the
('41', 121, 7, 25, 238476) 1 This was in reply to the addressees letter of January 9 in which he had refuted Gandhijis criticism of the Exhibition put up at the Congress Session at madras as being anti Indian; vide The National Congress, 5 1 1928.

('41', 122, 1, 2, 238739) very great reluctance with which, when I heard of the proposed exhibition of foreign textiles, I consented to hold the Khadi Exhibition?
('41', 122, 1, 3, 238876) Do you not remember that I did not care to have the Khadi Exhibition at all during the Congress Week?
('41', 122, 1, 4, 238978) I yielded only because you, an old friend, were insistent that I should hold the Khadi Exhibition and told me that you would be embarrassed if I did not hold it.
('41', 122, 1, 5, 239140) After I gave you my consent to hold it, I received letters of protest, but having given my word, I did not wish to withdraw.
('41', 122, 1, 6, 239265) If this does not satisfy you and if your letter was written for the public eye, I would gladly print it and reply.
('41', 122, 1, 7, 239380) I need hardly assure you that in all I have written I had nothing personal against you.
('41', 122, 1, 8, 239468) You were but one of the parties to the performance which in the present chaos is nothing extraor dinary.
('41', 122, 1, 9, 239573) I would even have kept silent but for the fear of the same thing being repeated at the next Congress.
('41', 122, 1, 10, 239675) Out course, it may be repeated in spite of my warning and protest.
('41', 122, 1, 11, 239742) If it is, I shall not accuse myself of cowardice.

('41', 123, 13, 24, 241573) DEAR FRIEND, I had your letter.
('41', 123, 13, 25, 241605) I have kept some to your letters in my Young India file yet for use.
('41', 123, 14, 26, 241674) 1 Of the Autobiography 2 This was a collection of Gandhijis writings on self control, brahmacharya birt control, etc., and included a series of articles published in Young India under the title Towards Moral Bankruptcy 3 Kathiawar Political Conference 4 Vide Correspondence, 16 2 1928.

('41', 124, 1, 2, 242002) About the proposed smriti, I cannot yet see eye to eye with you.
('41', 124, 1, 3, 242067) You often seem to emphasize the letter rather than the spirit.
('41', 124, 1, 4, 242130) When I use the word inspired, I do not give it a technical meaning.
('41', 124, 1, 5, 242198) When I feel inspired, you will find that nothing would deter me from giving a new smriti to Hinduism, and let me secretly tell you that I am aiming at such inspiration.
('41', 124, 1, 6, 242367) Till then I must wait.
('41', 124, 1, 7, 242390) It gave me such pleasure to be able to see you face to face in Madras.

('41', 124, 6, 13, 242597) BHAISHRI RATILAL, I have sent you a wire.
('41', 124, 6, 14, 242639) I got today a letter from Chi.
('41', 124, 6, 15, 242670) Devdas in which he tells me that you are very unhappy.
('41', 124, 6, 16, 242725) I can understand it.
('41', 124, 6, 17, 242746) But you must have patience.
('41', 124, 6, 18, 242774) I did not know about Sakubhais children, etc.
('41', 124, 6, 19, 242820) I know that he has left a big family.
('41', 124, 6, 20, 242858) You are the only one who can give them courage.
('41', 124, 6, 21, 242906) Birth and death are inseparable; why, then, should we rejoice at the former and mourn the latter?
('41', 124, 6, 22, 243004) We shall have done our best if we do our duty and, when our own time comes, meet death with a smiling face.

('41', 125, 6, 9, 243483) 146. AJMAL JAMIA FUND
('41', 125, 7, 10, 243505) I have now heard from Dr. Ansari regarding the fund to be raised in memory of the late Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan and for the purpose of putting the Muslim National University on a firm footing.
('41', 125, 7, 11, 243696) Dr. Ansari authorizes me to say that he and Principal Zakir Husain join me in making this appeal.
('41', 125, 7, 12, 243794) Sheth Jamnalalji Bajaj has consented to be the treasurer of the Fund.
('41', 125, 7, 13, 243864) In the existing raw state of feeling between Hindus and Mussalmans, it has not been thought advisable to issue this appeal under many names.
('41', 125, 7, 14, 244005) But our hope is that all those who revere the deceaseds memory and who approve of the idea of connecting the proposed memorial with the National Muslim University will help the movement as if they were joint partners in this appeal.
('41', 125, 7, 15, 244238) In my humble opinion, it is the duty of Hindus and Mussalmans who believe in unity to perpetuate Hakim Sahebs memory in the tangible form proposed.
('41', 125, 7, 16, 244386) It is their duty to ensure the stability of the Jamia, for it was a creation of the times when it was thought that the two communities were united for ever.
('41', 125, 7, 17, 244543) And if the non co operating national colleges do not stand for, work for and finally ensure unity, nothing else can or will.
('41', 125, 7, 18, 244668) I hope, therefore, that all the lovers of unity will liberally subscribe to the Fund.
('41', 125, 7, 19, 244754) There are today two hundred students studying in the central institution and seventy four in the city branch.
('41', 125, 7, 20, 244864) There are more over two night schools which draw nearly two hundred students.
('41', 125, 7, 21, 244942) The Jamia
('41', 125, 8, 22, 244952) 1 Names are omitted.
('41', 126, 0, 1, 244973) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 127
('41', 126, 1, 2, 245015) has a staff of twenty three workers.
('41', 126, 1, 3, 245052) The highest salary being paid is Rs. 265, the lowest being Rs. 35. The idea constantly before the Principal is to have volunteers who would draw just enough for their wants.
('41', 126, 1, 4, 245226) The salaries amount in all to Rs. 2,300 per month, the house rent is Rs. 425 per month.
('41', 126, 1, 5, 245314) The total monthly expenditure is Rs. 4,800. The regular income, including boarding fees Rs. 1,300, is Rs. 2,700. There is thus a deficit of Rs. 2,100. This was somehow met whilst Hakim Saheb was alive.
('41', 126, 1, 6, 245516) Before the teachers create for themselves a name and a prestige enough to command help, the deficit must be met by the public.
('41', 126, 1, 7, 245643) And the memorial cannot be considered lasting till the Jamia has a building of its own.
('41', 126, 1, 8, 245731) The subscribers will, therefore, in deciding the amount of donation bear in mind what is required.
('41', 126, 1, 9, 245830) Dr. Ansari tells me that the Central Bank has generously offered to receive subscriptions for the Ajmal Jamia Fund and to cash all cheques and drafts at par in all its branches.
('41', 126, 1, 10, 246008) The address of the treasurer is 395, Kalbadevi Road, Bombay.
('41', 126, 1, 11, 246069) Finally, all donations received will be held by the treasurer on behalf of us four as trustees and will be given only after a proper trust deed is created on behalf of the Jamia.

('41', 126, 3, 13, 246271) 147. TO NO CHANGERS
('41', 126, 4, 14, 246291) I see that the news that there was to be at Sabarmati a meeting of No Changers some time this month has found its way to the Press.
('41', 126, 4, 15, 246423) Prehaps this was inevitable.
('41', 126, 4, 16, 246452) But I am sorry to have to inform all concerned that the idea has been dropped for the time being at any rate.
('41', 126, 4, 17, 246562) Many No Changers have been long suggesting such a meeting with a view to the formation of a programme and a general interchange of views.
('41', 126, 4, 18, 246700) The demand became insistent at Madras when the No Changers who attended the Congress felt that on several resolutions they should have a definite joint policy and that they should be able to act as a distinct party within the Congress.
('41', 126, 4, 19, 246936) Though I was not enamoured of the idea of forming a party, I was not averse to the calling of a meeting of No Changers for the purpose of discussion.
('41', 126, 4, 20, 247086) But as I came to the drafting of a circular letter, I saw that it was a difficult performance and it was an equally dfficult thing to select the names of invitees.
('41', 126, 4, 21, 247250) I found both to be hopeless tasks.
('41', 126, 4, 22, 247285) On going into the thing deeper, I found that the convening of such a
('41', 127, 0, 1, 247354) 128 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 127, 1, 2, 247396) meeting might embarrass Dr. Ansari and make the working of the national programme of boycott more difficult by drawing the attention of country away from the boycott and distracting it by a discussion of matters that may well await a better opportunity.
('41', 127, 1, 3, 247650) I discovered further that the formation of a No Change party without me in it was not likely to function fully and vigorously so long as I was alive, available and retained a fairly healthy and active mind.
('41', 127, 1, 4, 247857) And the idea behind the suggested meeting was to form a party in which I need not take any part.
('41', 127, 1, 5, 247954) It may be theoretically possible, but in practice reference would always be made to me for opinion on many matters, which opinion would be more likely to be faulty than it would be if I was present at the discussion from which the matters for opinion might have risen.
('41', 127, 1, 6, 248223) These considerations made me incline to the view that the meeting might at least be postponed.
('41', 127, 1, 7, 248318) Vallabhbhai, with whom I first shared my revised opinion, agreed with me.
('41', 127, 1, 8, 248392) Other friends came to the same conclusion on other and independent grounds.
('41', 127, 1, 9, 248468) The idea of the meeting, therefore, remains under suspension for the time being.
('41', 127, 1, 10, 248549) I hope that the suspension will not disappoint the No co Changers.
('41', 127, 1, 11, 248616) I am not sure that it is not a better arrangement.
('41', 127, 1, 12, 248667) Whilst non operation as a national programme is partially suspended, individual non co operators have an opportunity of testing the strength of their faith.
('41', 127, 1, 13, 248824) Their faith will be all the stronger for standing alone without the warmth of a party.
('41', 127, 1, 14, 248911) When anything assums the strength of a creed which non co operation must be with those who still remain true to it, it becomes self sustained and derives the needed support from within.
('41', 127, 1, 15, 249097) Let us also have faith in the country that, when a forward movement becomes possible, all those who left non co operation will rejoin it whole heartedly.
('41', 127, 1, 16, 249251) I have no forward step to suggest at the present moment.
('41', 127, 1, 17, 249308) Anything intermediate I can suggest may disturb the joint programme that various parties in the country are trying to evolve.
('41', 127, 1, 18, 249434) Meanwhile, I can only invite the attention of No Changers to the great constructive programme of khadi.
('41', 127, 1, 19, 249538) Those who do not appreciate it do not understand the most potent and the most operative part of non co operation, viz., non violence.
('41', 127, 1, 20, 249672) Non co operation without non violence can never rise to the dignity of a creed and becomes merely one among many strategies in a campaign.
('41', 127, 1, 21, 249811) Non violent non co operation has been conceived as an infallible remedy replacing all others.
('41', 127, 1, 22, 249905) And khadi is the corner stone of its positive side.
('41', 127, 1, 23, 249957) Here is a reluctant testimony in favour of khadi given by Mr. Harcourt Robertson in the
('41', 128, 0, 1, 250045) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 129
('41', 128, 1, 2, 250087) Daily Despatch.
('41', 128, 1, 3, 250103) The writer is claimed by the editor to be one who has spent many years in British India where he was engaged in occupations demanding an intimate knowledge of market conditions and the Indian psychology.
('41', 128, 1, 4, 250307) I am indebted to The Leader of the 12th instant for the following: 1
('41', 128, 2, 5, 250376) He (Mr. Robertson) ascribes the heavy drop in the amount of British cotton fabrics purchased by India not to post war dislocation and economic stress, nor to the poverty of the masses, .
('41', 128, 2, 6, 250563) nor to famines .
('41', 128, 2, 7, 250580) but to the competition of Indian and Japanese mills and most of all to khaddar.
('41', 128, 2, 8, 250660) He regards khaddar as the real enemy.
('41', 128, 2, 9, 250698) He says:
('41', 128, 3, 10, 250707) Khaddar is a native made cloth, woven on primitive looms from hand spun yarn by unskilled, amateurish workers.
('41', 128, 3, 11, 250818) It is coarse, stiff, full of knots and faults, and always looks dirtyyet there is a positive vogue for it, even wealthy natives taking a pride in garments made from it.
('41', 128, 3, 12, 250987) For khaddar represents in concrete form the slogan of the rapidly growing Nationalist party: India for the Indians.
('41', 128, 3, 13, 251103) Not a penny of the money spent on it leaves the country.
('41', 128, 3, 14, 251160) He who wears it helps to feed Indias starving millions, proclaims his countrys independence and shows himself a patriot of the first water.
('41', 128, 3, 15, 251300) Khaddar is one of the weapons used by, and, indeed, invented by, Mahatma Gandhi in his fight against foreign rule in India.
('41', 128, 3, 16, 251424) Half saint, half fanatic, and wholly patriot, Mahatma Gandhi now speaks, in his person and through the native Press, to the very hearts of Indias educated classes.
('41', 128, 3, 17, 251588) Non co operation is not dead in India because it is no longer talked.
('41', 128, 3, 18, 251658) It has now reached the stage of silent and dangerous activity.
('41', 128, 3, 19, 251721) Let Mr. Gandhis missionaries once rope in the masses, and India will no longer be a poor buyer, she will be no buyer at all.
('41', 128, 3, 20, 251846) The blow is aimed not only at cotton.
('41', 128, 3, 21, 251884) It is a definite attempt to ruin the market for all British goods.
('41', 128, 4, 22, 251951) These remaks cannot but hearten those who have been working, under the inspiring leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, for the spread of khaddar .
('41', 128, 4, 23, 252090) Mr. Robertson is alarmed and .
('41', 128, 4, 24, 252121) he suggests that something should be done to give wide publicity in India to ideas such as Lancashire fabrics of Indian cotton, Indias best customer is Lancashire, To buy Lancashire cloth is to help Indias cultivators.
('41', 128, 4, 25, 252340) It is not by interested propaganda but by substantial concessions to the national demands of Indians that the relations of the two countries can be placed on a healthy footing and the causes which are operating to the detriment of Lancashiress trade with India removed.
('41', 128, 4, 26, 252610) Needless to say that khadi is not a threat.
('41', 128, 4, 27, 252654) It is the breath of national life like swaraj.
('41', 128, 4, 28, 252701) The khadi movement like swaraj cannot be

('41', 129, 10, 16, 253393) ROY, I thank you and Dr. Sircar for your letter and the medicine you have kindly sent me.
('41', 129, 10, 17, 253483) You know my repugnance to medicine.
('41', 129, 10, 18, 253519) I would not take anything that contained something taken from the human body except mothers milk.
('41', 129, 10, 19, 253617) The tabloids sent by you contain kidney and pancreas.
('41', 129, 10, 20, 253671) Isnt this something taken from a human body?
('41', 129, 10, 21, 253716) Supposing that it is taken from a sub human animal, my objection will still stand.
('41', 129, 10, 22, 253799) You know my weakness for dietetical experiments.
('41', 129, 10, 23, 253848) And ever since your discovery of excess of uric acid in my system, I have felt impelled to make a radical dietetic change.
('41', 129, 10, 24, 253971) The comparative stability in the Ashram has given me the opportunity and I am now taking simply fresh fruits and nuts.
('41', 129, 10, 25, 254090) The diet now consists of raisin tea,

('41', 130, 1, 2, 254236) which means about 40 raisins boiled and the skin and seeds removed.
('41', 130, 1, 3, 254304) This I take three times a day, and I add to it half an ounce of almond paste each time and twice two tolas of coconut milk and one or two oranges each time.
('41', 130, 1, 4, 254461) Coconut milk is prepared by pounding a fresh ripe coconut and extracting the juice by adding a little water and straining it through a stout piece of khadi.
('41', 130, 1, 5, 254618) This I had been doing for a fortnight without any way comming to harm.
('41', 130, 1, 6, 254689) The bowels are much more regular.
('41', 130, 1, 7, 254723) I have not been weighed nor have I had the blood pressure taken, but the feeling about me is good.
('41', 130, 1, 8, 254822) I have purposely refrained from taking the blood pressure and weight beacuse it seems to me to be of no consequence, if I otherwise keep fit.
('41', 130, 1, 9, 254964) As you have taken so much interest in my health, I thought I owed you the information of the change I have made and the reason why I will not take the medicine so thoughtfully sent by you.
('41', 130, 1, 10, 255153) I wish Indian medical men would make original researches and explore the possibilities of dietetic changes.
('41', 130, 1, 11, 255261) It may be that the general body of people will not take to what may be called austere ways of treating diseases, but may not poor fanatics like myself have a corner in the minds and hearts of medical men?
('41', 130, 1, 12, 255466) Has Indian medicine no fresh contribution to make to the medical science?
('41', 130, 1, 13, 255540) Or must it always rely upon the patented nostrums that, together with other foreign goods, are dumped down upon this unfortunate soil?
('41', 130, 1, 14, 255675) Why should the West have a monopoly of making researches?
('41', 130, 1, 15, 255733) This letter is not written to you for acknowledgement and reply unless you want to give me any direction.

('41', 131, 3, 4, 256165) MY DEAR SURESH BABU, I have your letter 1. I am glad at the happy termination of the Comilla afair.
('41', 131, 3, 5, 256265) Is it a reform from within or a reform super impossed?
('41', 131, 3, 6, 256320) With reference to my health, I have not seen my way to taking the medicine sent by Dr. Roy.
('41', 131, 3, 7, 256412) It is something extracted from the human body and I have the greatest repugnance to taking any such medicine.
('41', 131, 3, 8, 256522) But I have made radical change in my diet.
('41', 131, 3, 9, 256565) I am now living on simply fruits and a little almond nut paste and coconut milk.

('41', 132, 3, 8, 258034) How shall I convince you that, as long as the mill owners do not come to terms with us and we are not able to control their prices, their help will be not only useless but positively harmful.

('41', 133, 2, 3, 259293) January 22, 1928 With a view to avoiding the possibility of any misunderstanding between the rulers and the ruled, and with a view to fuller recognition of its own limitations, as also in confirmation of the custom which has been for some time in operation, this Conference resolves that it shall not pass any resolution condemning or criticizing any individual State.
('41', 133, 3, 4, 259662) Moving the above resolution Gandhi said: Young people would not appreciate the restriction imposed today, but I must realize my responsibility before I suggest that swaraj means the right to make mistakes.
('41', 133, 3, 5, 259868) Not only have I thought over it and then suggested it, but I have drafted the resolution myself.
('41', 133, 3, 6, 259965) Day before yesterday I advised the Subjects Committee not to pass the two resolutions criticizing individual States when the resolutions were moved in the Committee.
('41', 133, 3, 7, 260131) It came to me as an after thought that the advice given by me should hold good for some time more for the same reasons for which it was tendered.
('41', 133, 3, 8, 260277) It we do not resolve to this effect, our existence is in jeopardy.
('41', 133, 3, 9, 260344) But one may also argue why we should have such a restriction only to postpone the death.
('41', 133, 3, 10, 260433) The Committee would have turned down the resolution if it had been sponsored by any other person, but the Committee and the Kathiawaris have added to my responsibility by reposing faith in me.
('41', 133, 3, 11, 260626) I hope you would do the same by passing the resolution.
('41', 133, 3, 12, 260682) Young people will have to tolerate words such as misunderstanding, etc., which are found in the resolution.
('41', 133, 3, 13, 260790) At the Bhavnagar Session of the Conference 3 the question of only Jamnagar and Gondal States was discussed.
('41', 133, 3, 14, 260898) I had met the Jamsaheb and had discussions with him.
('41', 133, 3, 15, 260951) I know what the issue was and it, but due to pressure of work, I could not derive full benefit from the discussions.
('41', 133, 3, 16, 261068) I cannot say at the moment whether I won or lost.
('41', 133, 4, 17, 261118) 1 This was the fourth Conference.
('41', 133, 4, 18, 261152) 2 This resolution is reproduced from Weekly Letter, published in Young India, 26 1 1928. According to Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji was the author of the resolution.

('41', 134, 1, 2, 261472) suffered defeat at the hands of Thakore of Gondal; even then I did not allow any criticism of him individually.
('41', 134, 1, 3, 261584) At present the Conference is weak, lame and blind, and because I hold that we should not indulge in personal criticism I demanded here as well as in Bhavnagar that in the Conference no resolution or criticism on individual States should be allowed.
('41', 134, 1, 4, 261833) The participants as well as the office bearers of the Conference should be vigilant about such resolutions.
('41', 134, 1, 5, 261941) They should do what is worthy of them.
('41', 134, 1, 6, 261980) The ruler and the subjects should love each other and, in spite of their eagerness to point out to the ruler his shortcomings, they should put curbs on their speech and pen.
('41', 134, 1, 7, 262154) Such restraint would help us a lot.
('41', 134, 1, 8, 262190) Knowing our weakness, we should in future also adhere to the restraint which we have accepted in the two conferences.
('41', 134, 1, 9, 262308) A person who is conscious of his inadequacy feels relieved when he confesses it before the world.
('41', 134, 1, 10, 262406) If someone asks me what the brave people would do after the imposition of the restriction, I should say that such brave people have no place in the Conference.
('41', 134, 1, 11, 262566) Their place is outside the Conference.
('41', 134, 1, 12, 262605) They may form another association but this Conference is not meant for satyagrahis.
('41', 134, 1, 13, 262689) Even the congress is not for them.
('41', 134, 1, 14, 262724) This Conference does not restrain them.
('41', 134, 1, 15, 262764) They may criticize but should not malign others.
('41', 134, 1, 16, 262813) If I am asked what should be done if there is maladm inistration in a particular State, my answer would be that we should acquire the courage to criticize the State.
('41', 134, 1, 17, 262979) If the subjects being docile bear everything quietly, we should go to work amidst them in order to help them.
('41', 134, 1, 18, 263089) Injustice is there, but we should find out some other platform for its redress.
('41', 134, 1, 19, 263169) The princes are mutual friends and they wont allow any one of them to be criticized.
('41', 134, 1, 20, 263254) Of course, the Conference as such cannot indulge in the criticism or censure of individual States.
('41', 134, 1, 21, 263353) Apart from such criticism, you have enough work to do for khadi and for redressing the injustice inflicted on Antyajas by the sanatanis which is more severe than the injustice prevailing in the princely States.

('41', 135, 8, 9, 263909) January 24, 1928 If a Hindu does service to an untouchable he does not at all oblige the latter, he obliges only himself.
('41', 135, 8, 10, 264031) The Hindus, who were responsible for the existence of their so called untouchable brothers, have committed many sins.
('41', 135, 8, 11, 264149) Whatever they may do by way of self purification and expiation for these sins would be inadequate.
('41', 135, 8, 12, 264248) Therefore, whenever I have a chance to serve the untouchables, I consider it a God sent opportunity to do some slight atonement for past sins.
('41', 135, 8, 13, 264391) No one should feel elated, thinking that since he does some service he has no need at all for expiation.
('41', 135, 8, 14, 264496) I want to make it clear to you that we are all jointly responsible for the ill treatment given by a single Hindu.
('41', 135, 8, 15, 264610) It is a universal rule that the whole world is responsible for the sin committed by any one person.
('41', 135, 8, 16, 264710) Both Hindus and Muslims should accept this rule.
('41', 135, 8, 17, 264759) As long as there are barriers of caste and community in this world, the group as a whole is responsible for sin of every individual member.
('41', 135, 8, 18, 264899) A temple is not merely an edifice of brick or marble, nor does it become a temple by the installation of the image of a deity.
('41', 135, 8, 19, 265026) It can be called a temple only when life has been breathed into the image.
('41', 135, 8, 20, 265101) There may be hypocrisy in calling the priest and making sacrificial
('41', 135, 9, 21, 265169) 1 Sister of Mirabehn 2 A village in the then princely State of Bhavnagar in Saurashtra.
('41', 135, 9, 22, 265257) Gandhiji laid the foundation stone of the temple of Rama for the untouchables.
('41', 136, 0, 1, 265336) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 137
('41', 136, 1, 2, 265378) offerings at the time of laying the foundation of the temple.
('41', 136, 1, 3, 265440) The truth is that those who made a pious resolve to build a temple should, from that very moment, spend their life in deeds of penance and should surrender to the temple the fruits of all their good deeds.
('41', 136, 1, 4, 265646) The managers and the priests of the temple should be leading a life of austerity so that ones heart is moved as soon as one enters the temple.
('41', 136, 1, 5, 265789) If this is not going to be that type of a temple, if sufficient purity of heart and mind is not behind it, it is merely a building and, take it, it is a burden on the earth.
('41', 136, 1, 6, 265963) Since it would be called a temple, the area occupied by it would go waste; it can be put to no use and it may turn out to be a pernicious institution and even a haunt of many sins.
('41', 136, 1, 7, 266144) I have laid the foundation stone of this temple in the belief that no such defects are here.
('41', 136, 1, 8, 266237) To lay the foundation stone as soon as the idea of constructing a temple occurs and then to live in the hope of erecting a temple some day is not good.
('41', 136, 1, 9, 266389) Nothing is achieved in haste; the plants of religion do not grow fast.
('41', 136, 1, 10, 266460) True faith, industry and patience are the prerequisities for this.
('41', 136, 1, 11, 266527) I should lie to say only this to the untouchable brethren: the Hindu precept which says that no one can go to heaven before death is perfectly true.
('41', 136, 1, 12, 266676) You have to work yourselves for your own uplift.
('41', 136, 1, 13, 266725) Do not believe that the caste Hindus are helping you; by serving you they are in fact helping themselves.
('41', 136, 1, 14, 266831) If you wish to show your mettle, wake up.
('41', 136, 1, 15, 266873) Give up those faults for which the Hindus blame you and shun you.
('41', 136, 1, 16, 266939) Please make it a rule that those amongst you who are given to drinking, meat eating and so on do not enter the temple.
('41', 136, 1, 17, 267058) Do not point to the defects of the so called high caste Hindus.
('41', 136, 1, 18, 267122) As the saying goes, those in power can do no wring, the world will forgive them but not you.
('41', 136, 1, 19, 267215) Whatever may be the defects of others, you must try to remove your own.

('41', 137, 1, 2, 267365) 157. SPEECH AT MORVI 1
('41', 137, 2, 3, 267388) [January 24, 1928] 2
('41', 137, 3, 4, 267409) I sincerely thank the Maharaja Saheb, the people and members of the Modh 3 community for having welcomed my companions and myself and for presenting me with an address.
('41', 137, 3, 5, 267578) I should, at any rate, tell my brothers belonging to the Modh caste that I have no right whatsoever to accept an address of welcome from them.
('41', 137, 3, 6, 267721) Not even in my dreams have I imagined that I have in any manner served this caste as such; there are some gentlemen who believe that I have not only not served this caste but rather have caused it some harm.
('41', 137, 3, 7, 267929) If I accept this allegation for the moment, your address merely suggests your large heartedness.
('41', 137, 3, 8, 268026) However, I am not content with this large heartedness because, although it may be a sign of generosity, there is always an implicit understanding between the giver and the receiver of an address of welcome that the giver blesses and approves of the work that is being done by the receiver.
('41', 137, 3, 9, 268316) I hesitate to accept your address, as there is no such understanding between us.
('41', 137, 3, 10, 268397) There is a purpose behind what I am saying about your small caste; for I believe that these small barriers must be broken down.
('41', 137, 3, 11, 268525) I am clear in my mind that there is no room for castes in the Hindu faith; I say this to those belonging to the Modh or any other caste who happen to be present here.
('41', 137, 3, 12, 268692) In the true Shastras there is no reference to castes; there is a reference only to the four varnas, God has washed his hands off after creating these four varnas.
('41', 137, 3, 13, 268855) There is not even a trace of castes in the varnadharma.
('41', 137, 3, 14, 268911) I wish to tell all of you, and plead with all, through the Modhs, that you should forget the barriers created by caste.
('41', 137, 3, 15, 269031) Make use of the castes that exist today in destroying the caste system, offer them to the sacrificial fire and, if there is anything in them that teaches you self control, practise it.
('41', 137, 3, 16, 269216) A foul smell is emitted by such puddles if we do not clear them.
('41', 137, 3, 17, 269281) The doctors advise us to fill up puddles.
('41', 137, 3, 18, 269323) In addition to giving off a foul smell, they breed mosquitoes and these in turn prove fatal.
('41', 137, 3, 19, 269416) You must realize that these caste puddles are likewise fatal to man.
('41', 137, 3, 20, 269485) You must realize that God would never create such a deadly organization.
('41', 137, 3, 21, 269558) You will be happy if

('41', 138, 1, 2, 269792) you act upon these words which I speak out of my own experience.
('41', 138, 1, 3, 269857) Time goes on, doing its own work.
('41', 138, 1, 4, 269891) You can go and raise your hand against it if you wish to, but you must realize that it is all futile.
('41', 138, 1, 5, 269993) If we foolishly delay things, trying to defend these barriers against the march of time, it would be like the game of trying to throw dust on the sun and throwing it in our own eyes.
('41', 138, 1, 6, 270176) I would not have spoken thus to you nor would I have had the occasion to do so if you had not presented me this address.
('41', 138, 1, 7, 270297) Do not regard this as an insignificant matter.
('41', 138, 1, 8, 270344) For many years now we have been steeped in superstition and ignorance; do not give these the name of knowledge.
('41', 138, 1, 9, 270456) Comparative studies of different religions are being made in the world today, and if you examine these without any prejudice, you will find that these castes act as barriers to progress, to dharma, to swaraj and to the Ramarajya of which I speak so often.
('41', 138, 1, 10, 270712) I would like to ask you: What are the achievements of the Modh caste that should prompt us to sing its praises exclusively? We find that many cases there is a contradiction between our thoughts and actions.
('41', 138, 1, 11, 270919) Our conduct is at variance with our proclaimed beliefs.
('41', 138, 1, 12, 270975) This is like the track remaining even after the disappearance of the snake.
('41', 138, 1, 13, 271051) Make a Bhagiratha prayatna 1 to bring about conformity between your beliefs and your conduct.
('41', 138, 1, 14, 271145) In return for the address of welcome that you have given me I would ask you to make this effort.
('41', 138, 1, 15, 271242) If you also accept the implicit understanding of which I spoke, I shall feel that I did well to have accepted your address and to have been born in your caste.
('41', 138, 1, 16, 271402) I have been making the most sincere efforts to bring about conformity between my thought and action and hence it was that the Modh caste used to boycott me, although the Modhs realized later on that I did not deserve boycott as I never even thought of taking any advantage of the caste system.
('41', 138, 1, 17, 271696) I wish to carry forward this attempt of mine to break down caste barriers.
('41', 138, 1, 18, 271771) Perhaps you do not know that I got one of my sons married outside my caste and have lost nothing by doing so.
('41', 138, 1, 19, 271881) My son got bride from a devout Vaishnava family, for which he is grateful to me.
('41', 138, 1, 20, 271962) I could claim that by doing so I have stolen a gem belonging to another caste.
('41', 138, 1, 21, 272041) I ask those belonging to the smaller castes to hand their daughters over to me, if the latter cannot be married off.
('41', 138, 1, 22, 272158) I shall get them married to good upright boys belonging to other castes, the marriage expenditure being no more

('41', 139, 1, 2, 272395) than a tulsi leaf or a hank of yarn.
('41', 139, 1, 3, 272432) If other castes do not hesitate to hand over their girls to me who has adopted an untouchable girl as daughter, why should you have any fear?
('41', 139, 1, 4, 272574) I am getting my son 1
('41', 139, 2, 5, 272596) married to a Modh girl after three days.
('41', 139, 2, 6, 272637) I carry on my duties in this manner and find no difficulty in doing so.
('41', 139, 2, 7, 272709) In this way, through the Modh caste, I wish to ask all those who recognize such barriers, to break them.
('41', 139, 2, 8, 272814) The eighteen varnas are mere myth; there are only four varnas, so divided on the basis of their occupational aptitudes.
('41', 139, 2, 9, 272934) The customs in respect of eating and drinking with others are a part of untouchability, whereas the varnas are like a beautiful tree under the shade of which mankind can find shelter and nourishment for itself.
('41', 139, 2, 10, 273145) The system of varnas is the dharma of self control; there is no economic consideration involved in it but its object is to enable people to practise their dharma.
('41', 139, 2, 11, 273308) Sages and ascetics have conceived and organized it as a thoroughfare on which one could tread the path of ones dharma, whereas it has now become the means of furthering our self interest, our vices, and the gratification of our senses.
('41', 139, 2, 12, 273544) Try to preserve the varna system in its pure form.
('41', 139, 2, 13, 273595) In my opinion swaraj and Ramarajya are one and the same thing; however, I do not often use the latter expression before audiences of men.
('41', 139, 2, 14, 273733) This is so because, in this age of rationalism, if one who talks of the spinning wheel to women talks also of Ramarajya, this would appear to our intelligent young men as idle sermonizing.
('41', 139, 2, 15, 273922) They want swaraj, not Ramarajaya, and of swaraj too they give strange definitions which, in my opinion, are absurd.
('41', 139, 2, 16, 274038) But today, while I am standing before the Maharaja Saheb and his subjects, when the former has poured out his heart to me for an hour, I also feel like speaking out my mind before him.
('41', 139, 2, 17, 274223) The conce pt of swaraj is no ordinary one; it means Ramarajya.
('41', 139, 2, 18, 274286) How will that Ram arajya come to be established?
('41', 139, 2, 19, 274335) When will it come into being?
('41', 139, 2, 20, 274365) We call a State Ramarajya when both the ruler and his subjects are straightforward, when both are pure in heart, when both are inclined towards self sacrifice, when both exercise restraint and self control while enjoying worldly pleasures, and, when the relationship between the two is as good as that between a father and a son.
('41', 139, 2, 21, 274695) It is because we have forgotten this that we talk of democracy or the government of the people.
('41', 139, 2, 22, 274791) Although this is the age of democracy, I do not know what the word connotes; however, I woudl say that democracy exists where the peoples voice

('41', 140, 1, 2, 274993) is heard, where love of the people holds a place of prime importance.
('41', 140, 1, 3, 275063) In my Ramarajya , however, public opinion cannot be measured by counting of heads or raising of hands.
('41', 140, 1, 4, 275166) I would not regard this as a measure of public opinion; the verdict of the panch should be regarded as the voice of God.
('41', 140, 1, 5, 275287) Those who raise hands are not the panch.
('41', 140, 1, 6, 275328) The rishis and the munis after doing penance came to the conclusion that public opinion is the opinion of people who practise penance and who have the good of the people at heart.
('41', 140, 1, 7, 275508) That is the true meaning of democracy.
('41', 140, 1, 8, 275547) It is not democracy but something else that is reflected in the support secured by someone like me who makes a vote catching speech.
('41', 140, 1, 9, 275680) The democracy that I belive in is described in the Ramayanain the essence that is derived from my simple and straightforward reading of it.
('41', 140, 1, 10, 275820) What was the manner in which Ramachandra ruled?
('41', 140, 1, 11, 275868) The rulers of today assume that it is their birthright to rule and they do not recognize the peoples right to voice their opinion.
('41', 140, 1, 12, 275999) However, you rulers who may be regarded as the descendants of Rama, do you know how he ruled?
('41', 140, 1, 13, 276093) You may also be regarded as the descendants of Krishna.
('41', 140, 1, 14, 276149) And what did Krishna do?
('41', 140, 1, 15, 276174) He was the most perfect servant; at the time of the rajasuya yajna, he washed everyones feet.
('41', 140, 1, 16, 276268) That he actually washed his subjects feet may be fact or legend, that custom may or may not have been prevalent at the time; its under lying implication, however, is that, at the sight of his subjects, he bowed to them or rather bowed to their wishes.
('41', 140, 1, 17, 276520) This very matter has been diffe rently presented in the Ramayana.
('41', 140, 1, 18, 276586) Through his secret agents Ramachandra elicits public opinion and finds that Sita is the object of censure in a particular washermans home.
('41', 140, 1, 19, 276725) He was well aware that this adverse criti cism was groundless; Sita was dearer to him than his own life, nothing could lead to a difference between him and her; nevertheless, he renounced her, realizing that it was improper to let such criticism continue.
('41', 140, 1, 20, 276981) As a matter of fact, Ramachandra and Sita had become one; they lived for and in each other; nevertheless, he thought it necessary to endure the physical absence of that very Sita for whom he led an army to battle, whose presence he desired day and night.
('41', 140, 1, 21, 277236) Rama honoured public opinion in this manner; his rule is called Ramarajya.
('41', 140, 1, 22, 277311) Even a dog could not be harmed in that State, as Ramachandra felt that all living beings were part of him self.
('41', 140, 1, 23, 277423) There would be no licentious conduct, no hypocrisy, no falsehood in such a State.
('41', 140, 1, 24, 277505) A peoples government would function in such a truthful age.
('41', 140, 1, 25, 277565) The ruler forsakes his dharma when this age ends.
('41', 140, 1, 26, 277615) Attacks will then be made from outside the State
('41', 141, 0, 1, 277664) 142 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 141, 1, 2, 277706) Germs from outside attack the body when the blood becomes impure.
('41', 141, 1, 3, 277772) Likewise when society as a body gets corrupted, people who are like its limbs are subjected to external attacks.
('41', 141, 1, 4, 277885) However, when there is a bond of affection between the ruler and the ruled, the people as a body can face attacks.
('41', 141, 1, 5, 278000) The authority exercised by the State should be one of love; the sceptre does not signify the exercise of brute force but rather a bond of love.
('41', 141, 1, 6, 278144) The word Raja is derived from the root raj which means that which is befitting.
('41', 141, 1, 7, 278224) Hence Raja implies one who does credit to the office.
('41', 141, 1, 8, 278278) The people are not as wise as he is.
('41', 141, 1, 9, 278315) He has bound the people to himself with the bonds of affection and he is a servant of his servants.
('41', 141, 1, 10, 278415) Shri Krishna was such a servant and he was subjected to kicks like a servant.
('41', 141, 1, 11, 278493) Hence I tell the rulers and the chiefs that if they wish to be known as the descendants of Rama and Krishna, they should be prepared to put up with their subjects kicks.
('41', 141, 1, 12, 278663) They should put up with the latters abuses; although the people may act in an irresponsible manner, the ruler cannot do so.
('41', 141, 1, 13, 278787) If the rulers did, the world come to an end.
('41', 141, 2, 14, 278832) Can not this country which is primarily agricultural with seven lakhs of village in it, save itself from this machine age?
('41', 141, 2, 15, 278955) It consists of living machines and saving them is the only means of saving the country.
('41', 141, 2, 16, 279043) They are the cow and her progeny, human beings and their descendants.
('41', 141, 2, 17, 279113) If those who have living machines at their disposal and who can always add to this wealth, would become worshippers of the machine age, they will be cursed by humanity.
('41', 141, 2, 18, 279282) If this country, which was once ruled by mighty emperors and which has thirty three crores of living machines in it, starts worshipping this machine age, you must conclude that we are descendants of Ravana and not of Rama.
('41', 141, 2, 19, 279505) These are harsh words but they are inspired by love and come from the heart.
('41', 141, 2, 20, 279582) The maharaja Saheb sopke to me sincerely.
('41', 141, 2, 21, 279624) Wherever I come across sincerity, I forget myself and reciprocate with all my heart.
('41', 141, 2, 22, 279709) If not today, after my death, you will realize that what I said was right.
('41', 141, 2, 23, 279784) You will be cutting your own throats the day you give too much importance to the machine age.
('41', 141, 2, 24, 279878) If some Chengiz Khan invades us in future and through slaughter reduces the 33 crores to 3 lakhs, we may then need machines just as Britain and the United State need them.

('41', 142, 1, 3, 280258) Whom are you going to rob?
('41', 142, 1, 4, 280285) There is no reason why our country should remain poor when it has so much natural beauty, good climate, a variety of plant life and an inexhaustible store of other resources.
('41', 142, 1, 5, 280460) We have become our own enemies.
('41', 142, 1, 6, 280492) It is for this very reason that I keep insisting upon khadi.
('41', 142, 1, 7, 280553) I request you to maintain an eternal bond of mutual affection.
('41', 142, 1, 8, 280616) What the ruler is like will depend on his subjects and vice versa.
('41', 142, 1, 9, 280683) What can the ruler do if the people, are dishonest, cowardly, deceitful and wicked?
('41', 142, 1, 10, 280767) If the ruler is a good man, his soul may perhaps be spared; but he cannot save his subjects.
('41', 142, 1, 11, 280860) If they cannot protect their women themselves, how can the ruler do so?
('41', 142, 1, 12, 280932) In a town of the size of Morvi with a population of twelve to fifteen thousandfor whose good and to what end should there be so many factions and so many disputes?
('41', 142, 1, 13, 281096) You should give up these things.
('41', 142, 1, 14, 281129) There is no dharma other than truth and non violence.
('41', 142, 1, 15, 281183) Why should you, who are devotees of non violence, indulge in intrigues?
('41', 142, 1, 16, 281255) Passion and malice are nothing but violence.
('41', 142, 1, 17, 281300) Non violence does not merely consist in sparing the lives of bed bugs or flies.
('41', 142, 1, 18, 281380) That indeed is non violence in its lowest from.
('41', 142, 1, 19, 281428) The world is sanctified by one out of whose heart love flows constantly like a streamthese are not my words but the words uttered by Mahavira, the words uttered in the Gita.
('41', 142, 1, 20, 281602) I have had just a slight experience of this.
('41', 142, 1, 21, 281647) My mission is fulfilled by my endeavours to practise truth and non violence.
('41', 142, 1, 22, 281724) You will save yourselves if you practise these.
('41', 142, 1, 23, 281772) However, your khadi or your cattle cannot be spared if you give in to hypocrisy or deceit.
('41', 142, 1, 24, 281863) You will find it easy to practise what I have preached if you have a vision of the stream of truth, of the Ganga of non violence.

('41', 143, 1, 2, 282072) 158. BOYCOTT OF BRITISH GOODS
('41', 143, 2, 3, 282102) It is not at all surprising that the nation should wish to show resentment of the studiously insulting and defiant acts of the British Government.
('41', 143, 2, 4, 282249) Every new discovery in the direction adds fuel to the fire.
('41', 143, 2, 5, 282309) The latest is the abhorrence the late King Edward VII and his son, the present King, are reported to have betrayed of natives and that in connection with Lord Sinha.
('41', 143, 2, 6, 282475) The representatives of the nation have for years past endeavoured to demonstrate their resentment by bringing about a partial or complete boycott of British goods.
('41', 143, 2, 7, 282639) It is the nations right to bring it about if it so wishes.
('41', 143, 2, 8, 282698) There is no doubt that it will produce a great effect if it could succeed to the necessary extent.
('41', 143, 3, 9, 282797) But it has been my misfortune or good fortune consistently to oppose the cry for the boycott of British goods.
('41', 143, 3, 10, 282908) Though I adhere to the fundamental ground that the proposed boycott is contrary to non violence, I wish to confine myself at present to an examination of its possibility.
('41', 143, 3, 11, 283079) The fact that we have hitherto made no headway whatsoever with it, in spite of the agitation for so long a time, is proof presumptive of its very great difficulty.
('41', 143, 3, 12, 283243) If we were to take even such a simple instance as soap, we shall discover that we have made no progress even in the boycott of British made soap.
('41', 143, 3, 13, 283389) The Committee appointed by the Congress recommended certain articles for boycott.
('41', 143, 3, 14, 283471) So far as I am aware, no such effort has yet been made in the direction of excluding even one such article from the nations use.
('41', 143, 3, 15, 283600) The use of a punitive boycott lies in the effectiveness.
('41', 143, 3, 16, 283657) Anyone studying the articles of import will soon discover the utter futility of spending labour on achieving the boycott of most of these articles from the standpoint of creating an impression on the British Government.
('41', 143, 3, 17, 283877) It should not be forgotten that for all these long long years, we have not been able to have a body of specialists devoted to this single task.
('41', 143, 3, 18, 284021) It is the fashion in some quarters nowadays to blame me for the failure of any and every resolution that the Congress passes.
('41', 143, 3, 19, 284147) I am told that a particular resolution does not succeed because I oppose it or do not work at it.
('41', 143, 3, 20, 284245) There can be nothing more humiliating for a nation than to be in such an impotent state.
('41', 143, 3, 21, 284334) Surely boycott of British goods was conceived and vehemently advocated before I returned from South Africa.
('41', 143, 3, 22, 284442) The real and the more natural reason for the failure of the British goods boycott resolution lies in the obvious fact that no committee of
('41', 144, 0, 1, 284581) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 145
('41', 144, 1, 2, 284623) experts has yet been able to arrive at a satisfactory plan of working it out.
('41', 144, 1, 3, 284701) It has been suggested that we can succeed if China has succeeded.
('41', 144, 1, 4, 284767) Yes, we can if we have the will, the courage and the opportunity to regulate the boycott by armed force, by creating an army of open revolutionaries, by forcing for that specific purpose a strike of dock labourers and others connected with the handling of British goods.
('41', 144, 1, 5, 285038) It seems to me that even if we have the will, we have neither the means nor yet the capacity for managing such an open armed revolution.
('41', 144, 1, 6, 285175) And neither those who have advocated boycott of British goods nor the special Committee appointed by the Civil Disobedience Inquiry Committee have ever contemplated armed force.
('41', 144, 1, 7, 285353) I hold, therefore, that it will be more consistent with national dignity, prestige and welfare to give up the cry, proved to be useless, and almost impossible, of boycott of British goods.
('41', 144, 1, 8, 285542) The permanent necessity of advocating true swadeshi in all things capable of being produced at home is untouched by the argument against the punitive boycott.
('41', 144, 1, 9, 285701) But there is no cause whatsoever for despair.
('41', 144, 1, 10, 285747) We have a means ready made and most effective of signifying our resentment over the series of wrongs being continuously heaped upon our devoted heads.
('41', 144, 1, 11, 285898) If we have the will, I claim that we have the present capacity of achieving a complete boycott not merely of British cloth but of all foreign cloth.
('41', 144, 1, 12, 286047) And if we do this, we not only successfully demonstrate our resentment, but we serve the masses in a manner we have never done before and we secure their co operation in a national effort.
('41', 144, 1, 13, 286236) We have got an army of workers for doing this work.
('41', 144, 1, 14, 286288) We have experts who have first hand knowledge of the thing.
('41', 144, 1, 15, 286348) There is no division of opinion on the propriety of the thing.
('41', 144, 1, 16, 286411) The only thing that retards our progress towards the completion of boycott of foreign cloth is our own disbelief.
('41', 144, 1, 17, 286525) It is strange but tragic that through our ignorance we believe more in the possibility of achieving a boycott of certain British goods than of foreign cloth.
('41', 144, 1, 18, 286683) But even this boycott of foreign cloth cannot be achieved without a well thought out and prepared plan.
('41', 144, 1, 19, 286787) If it is the mere boycott we want rather than the higher and the more permanent result in the shape of the economic well being of the masses, we can do so quickly enough if we receive the co operation of mills on our terms.
('41', 144, 1, 20, 287011) Without honest and hearty co operation of our weaving and spinning mills, to attempt to achieve the boycott with mill cloth would be to court suicide and to run into the arms of profiteering mill owners.
('41', 144, 1, 21, 287215) If indigenous mill cloth is to play a part in this national effort, the mills
('41', 145, 0, 1, 287293) 146 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 145, 1, 2, 287335) must come to terms with the Congress as to the kind of production and the prices to be charged.
('41', 145, 1, 3, 287431) The mill agents should with the consent and co operation of their shareholders cease to be merely trustees for themselves and shareholders, but both should become trustees for the whole nation.
('41', 145, 1, 4, 287625) Then, with khadi, foreign cloth can be successfully and permanently banished from the land.
('41', 145, 1, 5, 287717) But it is possible, even without the co operation of mills, though less easy in point of time, to achieve the boycott of foreign cloth through khadi alone.
('41', 145, 1, 6, 287873) Mills will still play a part, but that will be in spite of the owners.
('41', 145, 1, 7, 287944) Khadi will put an effective check on their head, it will prevent a famine of cloth and it will give life and hope and work to starving millions, reinstate weavers of plain cloth in their ancient calling and will eventually, but within a short time, lead to a replacing of foreign cloth and regularizing of mill profits.
('41', 145, 1, 8, 288264) Time limit can be determined by the strength of the nations will and its capacity for sacrificing a little of its taste for fine cloth and a little money never beyond the capacity of individual users of cloth.

('41', 146, 9, 11, 289416) BHAI RAJENDRA PRASADJI MISHRA, Your son has come to me and says that although he and his wife wish that she should give up purdah, you oppose this step.
('41', 146, 9, 12, 289569) He asks me what his duty is.
('41', 146, 9, 13, 289598) I have told him that, for the present, he should obey you, and engage a tutoress for his wife.
('41', 146, 9, 14, 289693) One can be sent from here.
('41', 146, 9, 15, 289720) I would advise you to allow the couple to act in accordance with their own wishes.
('41', 146, 9, 16, 289803) In this age purdah is not practicable, nor is it necessary.
('41', 146, 9, 17, 289863) In ancient times this evil custom did not exist.

('41', 147, 2, 6, 290556) The cutting from Forward is very interesting and somewhat painful reading.
('41', 147, 2, 7, 290631) I had read Lala Dunichands original article.
('41', 147, 2, 8, 290676) If Lala Dunichand reads the flaring headlines in Forward, he would either laugh or cry.
('41', 147, 2, 9, 290764) I hope he will only laugh as I have done.

('41', 148, 3, 5, 291462) DEAR DR.
('41', 148, 3, 6, 291471) MOONJE, You have been quite discreet in writing to me.
('41', 148, 3, 7, 291526) I would also agree with your general proposition.
('41', 148, 3, 8, 291576) But can we enforce it only among Muss almans, or can we begin the reform with them?
('41', 148, 3, 9, 291660) Have we not got in the country innumerable purely Hindu institutions?
('41', 148, 3, 10, 291730) Moreover, this Muslim University has no bar against the entry of Hindus.
('41', 148, 3, 11, 291803) As a matter of fact, there are already discharged Hindu graduates of this University who are doing good national service.
('41', 148, 3, 12, 291925) There are some Hindus in it even now studying.
('41', 148, 3, 13, 291972) Thirdly, even a sectional institution may be called national if its outlook is national and is in reality utilized for national advancement.
('41', 148, 3, 14, 292113) I would like you, therefore, if you can, to support this memorial to Hakimji.
('41', 148, 3, 15, 292191) Sharddhanandji Memorial stands on a different footing and in one respect a higher footing, because of the circumstances in which Swamiji met his death.
('41', 148, 3, 16, 292343) But the memorial as it has been conceived cannot be claimed to be national.
('41', 148, 3, 17, 292419) It is a purely Hindu memorial.
('41', 148, 3, 18, 292450) For, the shuddhi work as also untouchability are things for Hindus alone to look after.
('41', 148, 3, 19, 292538) The two, therefore, have to be kept separate.
('41', 148, 3, 20, 292584) Each has its own special object.
('41', 148, 4, 21, 292617) Yours sincerely,

('41', 148, 6, 23, 292663) 1 This was in reply to the addressees letter, dated January 18, in which, referring to the fund for Jamia Millia, he wrote: I have long been of opinion that it is such sectarian institutions which, amongst other causes, have been mainly responsible for emphasizing and exaggerating sectarian separateness, culminating eventually in such deplorable Hindu Muslim tension.
('41', 148, 6, 24, 293033) I shall be pleased to associate with any national scheme of a memorial to our revered and beloved late Hakimji as.
('41', 148, 6, 25, 293148) with any similar memorial to our revered late Swami Shraddhanand.
('41', 148, 6, 26, 293214) But better still, let there be a common memorial to both Swamiji and Hakimji which shall proclaim to the world that both Hindus and Muslims have.

('41', 149, 8, 13, 294253) Exactly at 9.30 a.m.
('41', 149, 8, 14, 294274) all gathered on the prayer ground and Gandhiji blessed the couple in a brief speech which was as solemn as the occasion itself.
('41', 149, 8, 15, 294402) It was a most moving scene in Gandhijis life.
('41', 149, 8, 16, 294448) Those present could see that Gandhiji on such occasions could be as human as any of them.
('41', 149, 8, 17, 294538) He was nearly moved to tears as he referred to Ramdas and Devdas as two of his sons who had been brought up exclusively by him and under his care.
('41', 149, 8, 18, 294685) The consciousness that the son had never deceived him, and had hidden none of his faults and failings from him nearly choked him with a feeling of grateful pride.
('41', 149, 8, 19, 294848) You have confessed your faults to me, but they have never alarmed me, for your frank confession has exonerated you in my eyes.
('41', 149, 8, 20, 294975) I am glad that you would rather be deceived by the whole world

('41', 150, 1, 2, 295390) that deceive anyone.
('41', 150, 1, 3, 295411) May you live always in the same truthful way.
('41', 150, 1, 4, 295457) You will guard your wifes honour and be not her master, but her true friend.
('41', 150, 1, 5, 295534) You will hold her body and her soul as sacred as I trust she will hold your body and your soul.
('41', 150, 1, 6, 295630) To that end you will have to live a life of prayerful toil, and simplicity and selfrestraint.
('41', 150, 1, 7, 295724) Let not either of you regard another as the object of his or her lust.
('41', 150, 1, 8, 295795) You have both had part of your training here.
('41', 150, 1, 9, 295841) Let your lives be consecrated to the service of the Motherland, and toil away until you wear out your bodies.
('41', 150, 1, 10, 295951) We are pledged to poverty.
('41', 150, 1, 11, 295978) You will, therefore, both earn your bread in the sweat of your brow as poor people do.
('41', 150, 1, 12, 296065) You will help each other in daily toil and rejoice in it.
('41', 150, 1, 13, 296123) I have given you no gifts.
('41', 150, 1, 14, 296150) I can give none except a pair of taklis and copies of my dearly beloved Bhagavad Gita and Bhajanavali.
('41', 150, 1, 15, 296253) Let the cotton garlands be a shield of protection for you.
('41', 150, 1, 16, 296312) Could I have procured rich gifts for you from friends, the world would rightly have ridiculed my conceit, but today it will bear testimony that I have given you only such things as become one in my position.
('41', 150, 1, 17, 296520) Let the Gita be to you a mine of diamonds, as it has been to me, let it be your constant guide and friend on lifes way.
('41', 150, 1, 18, 296640) Let it light your path and dignify your labour.
('41', 150, 1, 19, 296688) May God give you a long life of service !

('41', 150, 3, 22, 296787) January 27, 1928
('41', 150, 4, 23, 296804) In the evening he [Gandhiji] referred to the public aspect of the question.
('41', 150, 4, 24, 296880) He dilated on the pernicious system which had divided the four original varnas into numerous castes and sub castes and hoped that the wedding 2 just celebrated would perhaps be for the Ashram the last as between parties belonging to the same caste.
('41', 150, 4, 25, 297129) It behoved people in the Ashram to take the lead in this respect, because people outside might find it difficult to initiate the reform.
('41', 150, 4, 26, 297266) The rule should be on the part of the Ashram to discountenance marriages between parties of the same caste and to encourage those between parties belonging to different sub castes.
('41', 150, 4, 27, 297447) He wished girls could be kept unmarried up to 20 and even 25. Towards the end he again came back to the solemn significance of the ceremony.
('41', 150, 4, 28, 297588) Do not think that the Ashram has as its object the popularization

('41', 151, 1, 3, 297767) It has and will have the promotion of lifelong brahmacharya as its object.
('41', 151, 1, 4, 297842) It countenances marriage only to the extent that it serves as an instrument of restraint rather than of indulgence.
('41', 151, 1, 5, 297958) And those who are for a life of restraint must order their lives differently from those who are for indulgence.
('41', 151, 1, 6, 298070) Remember that there is always a limit to self indulgence but none to self restraint, and let us daily progress in that direction.

('41', 152, 3, 7, 299192) Is this not a very strange way of behaving?
('41', 152, 3, 8, 299236) Do you wish to look upon me as a father in law?

('41', 152, 8, 18, 299790) But you know my nature.
('41', 152, 8, 19, 299814) I cannot exist without dietetic experiment if I am fixed up at any place for any length of time.
('41', 152, 8, 20, 299911) You know too that it has always been my intense longing to revert to fruit and nut diet or at least a milkless diet if I at all could.
('41', 152, 8, 21, 300046) I find now that I can easily do so and so I have done it.
('41', 152, 8, 22, 300104) Now that I can pull on with it, it would be difficult for me to go back to milk until I am satisfied that it is not possible to do without milk.
('41', 152, 8, 23, 300249) I can only tell you that I shall not do anything obstinately.

('41', 153, 4, 13, 301480) I hope that your recovery will be rapid.
('41', 153, 4, 14, 301521) I shall look forward to your coming here as soon as you can.
('41', 153, 4, 15, 301582) I would like you to dismiss from your mind the idea that you owe anything either to the doctors or to me.
('41', 153, 4, 16, 301688) After all, we are on this earth to serve one another without expectation of reward.
('41', 153, 4, 17, 301772) Please remember me to the Khambhattas, and when you write to me next tell me how Khambhatta is doing.

('41', 154, 3, 4, 302220) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('41', 154, 3, 5, 302253) There is no need to learn Urdu, but if you fail to understand any word used in Navajivan and no one in the Ashram can explain it, write to me.
('41', 154, 3, 6, 302396) Prepare your own dictionary in this way.
('41', 154, 3, 7, 302437) Do not worry about Nikhil.
('41', 154, 3, 8, 302464) Those who have faith in prayer should have no anxiety whatever.
('41', 154, 3, 9, 302528) One implication of prayer is that every day we place our all, even our worries, at the feet of God.
('41', 154, 3, 10, 302628) After that there is no place for worries.

('41', 154, 6, 13, 302765) January 28, 1928 It is not my intention to disqualify the graduates or to say that the executive committee has not functioned well .
('41', 154, 6, 14, 302898) The reason for forming a non elective trust is that it should, instead of being opportunistic, pursue its aims.
('41', 154, 6, 15, 303010) And if it does not have the strength to do so, it should entrust the work to those who have it.
('41', 154, 6, 16, 303106) If its members cause delay in handing over their functions, we can either resort to satyagraha or they can be punished for wasting the peoples money.
('41', 154, 6, 17, 303256) The middle path would be that of going to the courts.
('41', 154, 6, 18, 303310) I am not on the committee, because I do not wish to remain on committees.
('41', 154, 6, 19, 303384) I have resigned from the managing committees of the Ashram and the Charkha Sangh.
('41', 154, 6, 20, 303466) Now I do not wish to take work by means of authoritywith iron handsbut through love, by touching your heart.
('41', 154, 6, 21, 303575) By not re maining on the committee, I want to show others who are not on it that their responsibility is not less.

('41', 155, 1, 2, 303960) 173. A SISTERS DIFFICULTY 1
('41', 155, 2, 3, 303988) [January 29, 1928] A sister writes :
('41', 155, 3, 4, 304025) A year ago I heard you speaking on the supreme necessity of every one of us wearing khadi and thereupon decided to adopt it.
('41', 155, 3, 5, 304150) But we are poor people.
('41', 155, 3, 6, 304174) My husband says that khadi is costly.
('41', 155, 3, 7, 304212) Belonging as I do to Maharashtra, I wear a sari nine yards long.
('41', 155, 3, 8, 304277) Now if I reduced the length of my sari to six yards, there would be a great saving, but the elders will not hear of any such reduction.
('41', 155, 3, 9, 304413) I reason with them that wearing khadi is the more important thing and that the style and length of the sari is absolutely immaterial, but in vain.
('41', 155, 3, 10, 304560) They say that it is my youth that puts all these new fangled notions into my head.
('41', 155, 3, 11, 304643) But I expect that they will agree to the proposed reduction in length if you are good enough to write to me, saying that khadi ought to be used, even at the cost of style of clothing.
('41', 155, 3, 12, 304827) I have sent the desired reply 2 to the sister.
('41', 155, 3, 13, 304874) But I take note of her difficulty here, as I know that the same difficulty is encountered by many other sisters as well.
('41', 155, 3, 14, 304995) The letter in question bears witness to the strong patriotic feeling of the writer, for there are not many sisters who, like her, are ready to give up old styles or old customs on their own initiative.
('41', 155, 3, 15, 305197) The number of such sisters and brothers is legion as would gladly have swaraj if it could be attained without suffering any discomfort or incurring any expenditure and in spite of their sticking to old customs, regardless of their propriety or the reverse.
('41', 155, 3, 16, 305454) But swaraj is not such a cheap commodity.
('41', 155, 3, 17, 305496) To attain swaraj implies the cultivation of a spirit of self sacrifice, including the sacrifice of provincialism.
('41', 155, 3, 18, 305610) Provincialism is a bar not only to the realization of national swaraj, but also the achievement of provincial autonomy.
('41', 155, 3, 19, 305730) Women perhaps are more responsible than men for keeping up this narrow spirit.
('41', 155, 3, 20, 305809) Variety is worth cherishing up to a certain limit, but if the limit is exceeded, amenities and customs masquerading under the name of variety are subversive of nationalism.
('41', 155, 3, 21, 305982) The Deccani sari is a thing of beauty, but the beauty must be let go if it can be secured only by sacrificing the nation.
('41', 155, 3, 22, 306104) We should consider the Kachchhi style of short sari or the Punjabi odhani to be really artistic if the wearing of khadi can be cheapened and facilitated by their means.
('41', 155, 3, 23, 306273) The Deccani,
('41', 155, 4, 24, 306286) 1 Translated by V. G. Desai from the Gujarati original published in Navajivan, 29 1 1928 2 This letter is not available.
('41', 156, 0, 1, 306407) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 157
('41', 156, 1, 2, 306449) Gujarati, Kachchhi and Bengali styles of wearing sari are all of them various national styles, and each of them is as national as the rest.
('41', 156, 1, 3, 306589) Such being the case, preference should be accorded to that style which requires the smallest amount of cloth consistently with the demands of decency.
('41', 156, 1, 4, 306740) Such is the Kachchhi style, which takes up only 3 yards of cloth, that is, about half the length of the Gujarati sari, not to mention the saving of trouble in having to carry a smaller weight.
('41', 156, 1, 5, 306933) If the pachhedo and the petticoat are of the same colour one cannot at once make out whether it is only a pachhedo or full sari.
('41', 156, 1, 6, 307062) The mutual exchange and imitation of such national styles is eminently desirable.
('41', 156, 1, 7, 307144) Well to do people might well keep in their wardrobes all possible provincial styles of clothing.
('41', 156, 1, 8, 307241) It would be very courteous and patriotic on the part of a Gujarati host and hostess to put on the Bengali style of dress when they entertain Bengali guests, and vice versa.
('41', 156, 1, 9, 307414) But such procedure is open only to the patriotic rich.
('41', 156, 1, 10, 307469) Patriotic people of the middle and poorer classes should take pride in adopting that particular provincial style which cheapens as well as facilitates the wearing of khadi.
('41', 156, 1, 11, 307642) And even there they should fix their eye upon the clothing style of the poorest of the poor.
('41', 156, 1, 12, 307735) Swadeshi does not mean drowning oneself in ones own little puddle but making it tributary to the ocean that is the nation.
('41', 156, 1, 13, 307858) And it can claim to contribute to the ocean only if it is and keeps itself pure.
('41', 156, 1, 14, 307939) It is therefore clear that only such local or provincial customs should have a nation wide vogue as are not impure or immoral.
('41', 156, 1, 15, 308066) And when once this truth is grasped, nationalism is transmuted into the enthusiasm of humanity.
('41', 156, 1, 16, 308162) What is true of clothing is equally true of language, food, etc.
('41', 156, 1, 17, 308227) As we might imitate the dress of other provinces on a suitable occasion, so might we utilize the language and other things.
('41', 156, 1, 18, 308351) But at present all our energy is wasted in the useless, impossible and fatal attempt to give English the pride of place to the neglect, conscious or unconscious, of our mother tongue and all the more so, of the languages of other provinces.

('41', 157, 1, 2, 308656) 174. KATHIAWAR POLITICAL CONFERENCE
('41', 157, 2, 3, 308692) The Conference met and is now over.
('41', 157, 2, 4, 308728) I have no comments to offer on Shri Thakkar Bapas 1 speech, on the attendance of the public, on the welcome given by the reception committee, on the gentleness and courtesy of the honourable Rana Saheb 2, on his presence in the Conference or the hospitality that he extended to the guestes.
('41', 157, 2, 5, 309019) Sheth Devidas left nothing undone so far as the reception was concerned.
('41', 157, 2, 6, 309092) He acted very well on behalf of Sheth Omar Haji Amod Zaveri who had been elected the chairman of the reception committee and did not hesitable to spend his own money in providing a welcome.
('41', 157, 2, 7, 309282) The speech of the President was worthy of the priest of Bhils and the Dheds.
('41', 157, 2, 8, 309359) The resolutions passed by the Conference were innocuous.
('41', 157, 2, 9, 309416) These did not interest me as they did not reflect any firm determination or power to put them into actual practice.
('41', 157, 2, 10, 309532) It seemed that many of those who put forward the resolutions thought that with the mere moving of them their duties were discharged.
('41', 157, 2, 11, 309665) I realized that this was not a khadi conference and inwardly experienced a sense of defeat.
('41', 157, 2, 12, 309757) I was alone concentrating on that subject.
('41', 157, 2, 13, 309800) I realized that I had been unsuccessful; my faith in khadi, however, did not waver.
('41', 157, 2, 14, 309884) I do not, therefore, wish to spell out my sorrow.
('41', 157, 2, 15, 309934) I wish to comment on one resolution alone.
('41', 157, 2, 16, 309977) I am the author of that resolution and I feel that, by framing it and getting it passed, I have served the Conference and Kathiawar.
('41', 157, 2, 17, 310110) That resolution runs as follows: 3
('41', 157, 3, 18, 310145) The acceptance of this resolution became possible because of my devotion to truth.
('41', 157, 3, 19, 310228) I found that this Conference could be held in Porbandar only because of some implicit understanding with the honourable Rana Saheb and that for some years to come it would be possible to hold such conferences only with such an understanding.
('41', 157, 3, 20, 310470) This reflected the measure of the weakness of the Conference.
('41', 157, 3, 21, 310532) No conference should be helpless to this extent.
('41', 157, 3, 22, 310581) There is something wrong somewhere when such helplessness is found to exist.
('41', 157, 3, 23, 310658) However, it is not got rid of by hiding it from view.
('41', 157, 3, 24, 310712) Those who try to be

('41', 158, 1, 2, 310992) secretive about their sickness merely increase its intensity; they ignore remedial measures and become their own enemies.
('41', 158, 1, 3, 311114) There were two occasions in the Subjects Committee when the members introduced two resolutions criticizing individual States.
('41', 158, 1, 4, 311240) I cannot claim that there was no reason for introducing these resolutions.
('41', 158, 1, 5, 311315) However, I clearly saw that it was beyond the power of the Conference to admit such resolutions or act on them.
('41', 158, 1, 6, 311427) The committee ruled out these resolutions.
('41', 158, 1, 7, 311470) However, I felt that the Conference could not continue to function long if it brought forward such resolutions.
('41', 158, 1, 8, 311582) Hence, I advised the Conference to declare to the world its own weakness, its own limitations.
('41', 158, 1, 9, 311677) I suggested that, by proclaiming the truth, the Conference will soon overcome its weakness and save itself.
('41', 158, 1, 10, 311785) This was a very bitter pill for the Subjects Committee to swallow.
('41', 158, 1, 11, 311852) I, too, did not like to give such advice; however, I could see clearly what my dharma was.
('41', 158, 1, 12, 311943) One should act in accordance with the truth, whether it happens to be pleasurable or painful.
('41', 158, 1, 13, 312037) Does not true happiness often appear to be like poison?
('41', 158, 1, 14, 312093) Although some members did not approve of this resolution, they as well as others accepted my advice because of their generosity and far sightedness.
('41', 158, 1, 15, 312242) Thereby, my responsibility has increased.
('41', 158, 1, 16, 312284) I know that I will be blamed if this resolution leads to any undesirable consequences.
('41', 158, 1, 17, 312371) Not only am I not afraid of these but I believe that, if the Conference implements that resolution in good spirit and does everything that is implied by it, the result must necessarily be rewarding.
('41', 158, 1, 18, 312570) Restrictions which are volun tarily imposed, self control which is voluntarily practised, are always beneficial to anyone who undertakes them.
('41', 158, 1, 19, 312713) There is no other condition which need be applied to a restriction thus voluntarily undertaken.
('41', 158, 1, 20, 312809) If the Conference abides by this resolution in thought, word and deed, it will thereby increase its capacity to fulfil its obligations within its province.
('41', 158, 1, 21, 312965) Before this restriction was imposed, rulers were hesitant to allow the Conference to be held, for fear of personal criticism and censure.
('41', 158, 1, 22, 313103) As the members were not clearly aware of their limitations, they made attempts, apparently glamorous but in fact futile, to rid the States of their individual shortcomings and, by doing so, were inattentive towards those tasks which, though apparently without glamour, were capable of being carried out.
('41', 158, 1, 23, 313407) Now, they will either perform these useful, though uninteresting, tasks or shut up shop.
('41', 158, 1, 24, 313496) As no one likes to become bankrupt, let us hope that the office bearers of
('41', 159, 0, 1, 313571) 160 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 159, 1, 2, 313613) the Conference will accomplish, willingly or unwillingly, those tasks which are worth accomplishing.
('41', 159, 1, 3, 313714) No one will interpret the above resolution to mean that in passing it we admit before the world that the States do not deserve any criticism.
('41', 159, 1, 4, 313856) We should not speak ill of anyone.
('41', 159, 1, 5, 313891) Although these States deserve criticism, we do admit that as we live within the boundaries of Kathiawar we do not have the capacity to criticize at the moment any State in Kathiawar or even elsewhere.
('41', 159, 1, 6, 314092) We have imposed the restriction for this very reason and in the hope that we shall be able to develop the strength to make such criticisms in the future.
('41', 159, 1, 7, 314246) The Committee of the Conference has the right, or rather the duty, to utilize the means at its disposal for the redressing of any grievances that it may find in any State, without bringing in resolutions in the Conference to that effect and without making any criticism against any individual State either directly or in an indirect manner at the Conference.
('41', 159, 1, 8, 314605) For instance, at the time when the Conference is in session, any member of the Subjects Committee can describe the drawbacks of any State in Kathiawar to his fellow members and ask for the guidance of the Committee on the matter.
('41', 159, 1, 9, 314835) The only restriction is that he cannot move a resolution on it in the session of the Conference.
('41', 159, 1, 10, 314932) He could meet that rulers or their officers and request them for redress, or if the grievances prove to be untrue he should declare them as such.
('41', 159, 1, 11, 315078) In other words, the Committee can approach each and every State through proper channels, in a friendly manner.
('41', 159, 1, 12, 315189) There is a possibi lity that if the States in question, after having come to know the idea behind this restriction, have not suddenly started acting in an irrespon sible manner and do not wholly disregard public opinion, they would wel come this step taken by the Committee and would even use it as a shield.
('41', 159, 1, 13, 315498) Here we should bear in mind that the Committee should not take undue advantage of such an investigation and publicly discuss the facts which have come to light; it should suffer in silence even if it cannot gain access to the States in question or gets no satisfaction even after gaining access, and realize that the remedy for the disease lies beyond its powers.
('41', 159, 1, 14, 315862) The outcome of such limited interference, or investigation if you wish to call it by that name, depends on the tact, industry and courtesy of the Committee.
('41', 159, 1, 15, 316019) It will be able to achieve nothing if it forms preconceived notions about those States and becomes prejudiced against them.
('41', 159, 1, 16, 316143) It should have the self confidence to melt the hearts of rulers.
('41', 159, 1, 17, 316208) Such self confidence can be acquired only through
('41', 160, 0, 1, 316258) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 161
('41', 160, 1, 2, 316300) supreme service to both the ruler and the ruled.
('41', 160, 1, 3, 316349) Both should be served in a dispassionate manner for their ultimate good and not in order to placate them.
('41', 160, 1, 4, 316455) The members of the Committee should not even dream of serving their own self interest through such service.
('41', 160, 1, 5, 316563) The belief that we do not wish to do away with the existence of Indian States but only ask for an improvement in these is at the very heart of this idea.
('41', 160, 1, 6, 316717) The Conference does not deserve to be held in the States at all if the idea behind it is to put an end to the system of princely States.
('41', 160, 1, 7, 316854) It is change and not destruction that can be brought about through non violence.
('41', 160, 1, 8, 316935) Democracy can be realized through the rulers; neither the ruler nor the ruled should be destroyed and whatever is good in both these can be harmoniously harnessed.
('41', 160, 1, 9, 317099) In short, the relationship between the two should be one of dharma and not of brute force.
('41', 160, 1, 10, 317190) The modern trend is towards destruction, whereas ancient culture is in favour of growth and nurture.
('41', 160, 1, 11, 317291) Non violence achieves the good of all, whereas violence bases the prosperity of one upon the destruction of another.
('41', 160, 1, 12, 317408) Democracy is not an advantage in all respects nor is monarchy altogether harmful.
('41', 160, 1, 13, 317490) Each has its own uses and it is the duty of the Political Conference to find these out, for it wishes to reach its goal by following the path of truth and non violence.
('41', 160, 1, 14, 317659) Let us examine what the Conference can do.
('41', 160, 1, 15, 317702) Khadi, the service of the untouchables, social reforms, etc., are of course there.
('41', 160, 1, 16, 317785) By taking up these activities the Conference should nurture democracy.
('41', 160, 1, 17, 317856) Administrative problems are not fewprohibition, education, the railway department, storage of rain water for the whole of Kathiawar, preservation of trees and their multiplication, introducing uniformity in the excise levy throughout Kathiawar as well as uniformity in its administration.
('41', 160, 1, 18, 318145) Other matters, too, which would be advantageous to both the ruler and the ruled can be enumerated.
('41', 160, 1, 19, 318244) Such matters are of the utmost importance and Kathiawar can subsist on these alone.
('41', 160, 1, 20, 318328) By disregarding them Kathiawar will bring about its own ruin.
('41', 160, 1, 21, 318390) In order to accomplish these tasks, the help of the officer class is required more than that of the rulers.
('41', 160, 1, 22, 318498) If the former are selfish or narrow minded, even the reforms decreed by the rulers cannot be brought about.
('41', 160, 1, 23, 318606) The officers are the limbs of the rulers and the officer class means the people.
('41', 160, 1, 24, 318687) The ruler would necessarily improve if the people improve; however, the larger section of the public which is vocal, happens to belong to the officer class.
('41', 160, 1, 25, 318844) Hence, so long as that section does not give up its self interest and adopt the path of
('41', 161, 0, 1, 318932) 162 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 161, 1, 2, 318974) morality, so long as it does not cease to worry over earning its livelihood, so long as these fearless persons do not comprehend the nature of public activities and take interest in them, there is little hope of any true reforms being introduced in the Indian States.
('41', 161, 1, 3, 319242) The greater part of the effort of the Political Conference should, therefore, be directed towards and concentrated on the people, as it is the people who are like roots whereas the rulers are like fruits.
('41', 161, 1, 4, 319447) If roots become sweet, fruits are bound to be sweet too.
('41', 161, 1, 5, 319504) Moreover, if the Kathiawar Political Conference is destined to add prestige to itself, there should be separate Conferences of State people in each of the more important States; these conferences may certainly criticize their own States in all matters, within the bounds of decency.
('41', 161, 1, 6, 319787) These conferences should develop their own strength; even in order to do so they should engage themselves in constructive activity.
('41', 161, 1, 7, 319919) The development of its strength depends on this.
('41', 161, 1, 8, 319968) Selfless and fearless workers are required for these activities.
('41', 161, 1, 9, 320033) Where to find them?
('41', 161, 1, 10, 320053) It those that are there, whatever their number, would keep on doing their duties silently, their number would multiply.
('41', 161, 1, 11, 320173) No one should entertain the cowardly thought: What could I achieve all by myself? 1
('41', 161, 2, 12, 320257) So far I have addressed my words to the people.
('41', 161, 2, 13, 320305) If the rulers could realize it, the above mentioned resolution has greatly added to their responsibilities.
('41', 161, 2, 14, 320413) To this day, they avoided and some even ignored the Conference for fear of its criticism and harsh words against them.
('41', 161, 2, 15, 320532) However, in my humble opinion, they should respect the Conference by appreciating its civilized nature, satisfy its demands and use it as a bridge between the people and themselves.
('41', 161, 2, 16, 320714) The evidence I have before me leads me to believe that it is not the case that all the States in Kathiawar are above criticism.
('41', 161, 2, 17, 320842) I have been told that there are some very major shortcomings in these.
('41', 161, 2, 18, 320913) They should come to recognize this age.
('41', 161, 2, 19, 320953) The chaos that is there in the world and has affected India too, is an important symptom.
('41', 161, 2, 20, 321043) It is certainly harmful in its chaotic form; however, the purpose underlying it is an honest one.
('41', 161, 2, 21, 321141) People worship morality, although they follow consciously or unconsciously a path that deviates from it.
('41', 161, 2, 22, 321246) They are tired of the blind forces of authority; they have become impatient.
('41', 161, 2, 23, 321323) And, in their impatience, although they may forget that the remedy adopted by them is even more dangerous than the disease itself, they are eager for reforms and for moral power.
('41', 161, 3, 24, 321502) 1 The following paragraph was addressed to the rulers.
('41', 162, 0, 1, 321557) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 163
('41', 162, 1, 2, 321599) Though devotees of truth and non violence like myself can see that morality will not be attained by their means, they are also aware that, if those in authority do not take this warning, destruction awaits them.
('41', 162, 1, 3, 321811) It is necessary for rulers to take this warning.
('41', 162, 1, 4, 321860) Let not perversity foreboding destruction prevail with them.
('41', 162, 1, 5, 321921) I am kept alive by my unwavering faith that India will never take to the path leading to moral death.
('41', 162, 1, 6, 322023) May the rulers prove my faith to be correct.

('41', 162, 3, 9, 322131) A worker asked whether a school for untouchables should be started in State A.
('41', 162, 3, 10, 322210) Gandhiji replied: I have heard at many places and from many persons that A is an unholy State; if that is true, we should not go there for any sacred work.
('41', 162, 3, 11, 322366) The only exception to this would be the work of removing the unholiness of that State.
('41', 162, 3, 12, 322453) As we have been living under British rule, it has acquired a certain kind of prestige; however, as we wish to break up this unjust administration from within, no other alternative is open to us.
('41', 162, 3, 13, 322648) Otherwise, for any good person to go or to live in an unholy State in order to carry out any other sacred work would amount to his going there to increase the prestige of that State.
('41', 162, 4, 14, 322831) Q. Is it necessary to have an all India satyagraha organization for introducing reforms in Indian States?
('41', 162, 5, 15, 322937) There were 60,000 people associated with my work in South Africa; how many of them continue to be satyagrahis today?
('41', 162, 5, 16, 323054) However, all the twenty two of you have been selected for the purpose of giving a helping hand whenever it becomes necessary.
('41', 162, 5, 17, 323180) Whenever you take up the workand you will not do so without exercising discretionyou will find many other people who will join hands with you.
('41', 162, 5, 18, 323323) If you are discreet satyagrahis the all India satyagraha organization that you envisage is not necessary.
('41', 162, 5, 19, 323429) The talent that lies hidden within you and in the country will manifest itself when occasion arises.
('41', 162, 6, 20, 323530) Q. How should the Satyagraha Dal grow in numbers and in quality?
('41', 162, 7, 21, 323595) 1 This and the following questions were asked by members of the Satyagraha Dal.
('41', 163, 0, 1, 323675) 164 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 163, 1, 2, 323717) A. Every satyagrahi should remain alert.
('41', 163, 1, 3, 323758) He should not be idle or lazy, he should not be lethargic or sick, so that he can be introspective.
('41', 163, 1, 4, 323858) He should keep on evaluating his own contribution to the activity which he has chosen for himself.
('41', 163, 1, 5, 323957) The commander in chief must maintain a record of the work done by each soldier.
('41', 163, 2, 6, 324037) Q. At present many persons are engaged in running schools for untouchables and in such other activities.
('41', 163, 3, 7, 324142) A. I would ask such satyagrahis how far they have been able to convert these children to satyagraha, to what extent they have been able to become one with the children.
('41', 163, 3, 8, 324311) If I may ask the children who these persons are, they should reply that they look upon their teachers alone as their fathers.
('41', 163, 3, 9, 324437) There are satyagrahi doctors amongst you.
('41', 163, 3, 10, 324479) Shall I tell you what a satyagrahi doctor should be like?
('41', 163, 3, 11, 324537) He would treat the poor before all others and would disregard me and others like myself who can get the services of doctors whenever they wish to.
('41', 163, 3, 12, 324684) He would ask a poor man whether he required a set of false teeth because he has lost his natural ones.
('41', 163, 3, 13, 324787) Such a doctor should not worry how he could thrive in his profes sion if he did not find people with bad teeth.
('41', 163, 3, 14, 324899) You should look up Hind Swaraj for a detailed description of a satyagrahi doctor 1. Such an individual should not even hope to make a living from his profession.
('41', 163, 3, 15, 325061) Dr. Wanless has per formed thousands of operations, people donate thousands of rupees to his institution, but he does not take a single pie out of it.
('41', 163, 3, 16, 325212) Sam Higgin bottom was the agricultural expert of the Scindia.
('41', 163, 3, 17, 325274) He received a salary of Rs. 4,000 a month for his advise; did he, however, take a single pie of it for his personal expenditure?
('41', 163, 3, 18, 325403) Yes, we do have our Dr. Chandulal 2; he acts in a similar fashion, he knows his own job very well, he does not take a single pie for himself and the poor can readily approach him.
('41', 163, 3, 19, 325583) The satyagrahi should dedicate himself to his chosen field of activity in a spirit of purity, and adhere to it.
('41', 163, 3, 20, 325695) His unflinching faith will be recognized by his truthful adherence to something which he has regarded as true although it may be untrue.
('41', 163, 3, 21, 325832) Tulsidas has said: The shell appears as a piece of silver and the suns rays appear as a sheet of watersuch is the character of illusion.
('41', 163, 3, 22, 325969) Though it is ever non existent, one cannot get rid of it.

('41', 164, 1, 2, 326214) Since we act as if the world is ultimately true, we should remain absorbed in such actions as would bring about the good of the world.
('41', 164, 1, 3, 326349) That alone is beneficial.
('41', 164, 2, 4, 326375) Q. Supposing State A has so deteriorated that satyagaha needs to be practised there, should we set up our camp in it?
('41', 164, 3, 5, 326493) A. No, your duty is to muster strength, remaining outside it and to educate public opinion in State A while doing so.
('41', 164, 3, 6, 326611) When you find that you have grown in strength and that a part of the fortress of State A has given way, if it appears that some Vibhishana can be found there, only then should the Satyagraha Dal invade it.
('41', 164, 3, 7, 326817) Despite such an attack the Dal should bear goodwill towards the ruler whild maladministration is the reason for this attack.
('41', 164, 3, 8, 326942) The Satyagraha Dal can set up its camp there when all these factors are present.
('41', 164, 3, 9, 327023) Meanwhile, you can educate the people of that State.
('41', 164, 3, 10, 327076) You can create an awareness of their sorry plight amongst the large number of people who visit your place.
('41', 164, 3, 11, 327183) You should train people of that State through boycott or by not going there even though you may have relations living there who may be celebrating a wedding or some such auspicious occasion.

('41', 164, 6, 16, 327546) I cannot help saying that you have been hasty in resigning.
('41', 164, 6, 17, 327606) You joined the Khadi Service not to please anybody but to serve the country, and no man who joins an institution for a good cause may leave it because of an injustice felt by or done to him 1 personally.
('41', 164, 6, 18, 327810) A conscientious man would regard as his own the institution to which he belongs, and, therefore, will carry out all the obligations without insisting on his rights.
('41', 164, 6, 19, 327975) If there is an injustice done, you should discuss it with Sjt.

('41', 169, 1, 2, 333744) the early hours of the morning, you will attend it.
('41', 169, 1, 3, 333796) If you do not, I shall certainly be sorry, but will not resent your absence.
('41', 169, 1, 4, 333873) In the same way, I should like you to accompany me every evening to the Ashram to attend the evening prayer there.
('41', 169, 1, 5, 333988) That also you will do if the spirit moves you, and if you feel that your work will permit you to do so.
('41', 169, 1, 6, 334092) I want you to go there, not because I want you to join the Ashram, though I would be glad if you did so, but because I want you to understand and identify yourselves somewhat with the Ashram.
('41', 169, 1, 7, 334284) For I make no secret of it that the Ashram is the best of my creations.
('41', 169, 1, 8, 334356) I can myself point out numerous defects in it, and can add many more from your own experience.
('41', 169, 1, 9, 334451) But I assure you that I am more conscious of them than anyone else and yet I hold that, with all its shortcomings, it is the best of my creations.
('41', 169, 1, 10, 334598) I would have me and my work judged by the Ashram more than by anything else.
('41', 169, 1, 11, 334675) Hence I would love you to attend the evening prayer daily.
('41', 169, 1, 12, 334734) But this is a mere suggestion to be rejected or adopted out of your own free will.
('41', 169, 1, 13, 334817) Let me not live in your midst as a burden, but as a friend, and, if possible, a guide if you will.
('41', 169, 1, 14, 334916) I am willing to give you a quarter of an hour every day or two periods every week just as you might desire.
('41', 169, 1, 15, 335024) I am not sure what I shall read with you, but that also I shall leave to you to decide.

('41', 170, 9, 17, 336375) Miss Mayo is clearly trading upon her knowledge that what we in India write can at best reach but a few hundred Americans, and that what she writes reaches thousands.
('41', 170, 9, 18, 336542) She therefore feels per fectly free, just as it suits her, to misquote, half quote or distort other peoples writings or speeches intended to contradict her.
('41', 170, 9, 19, 336699) She has done me the honour again of referring to me in her article in Liberty attempted to discredit my writing about her compilation, Mother India This she has felt called upon to do, I suppose, because I enjoy a certain amount of credit among cultured Americans, and lest therefore their judgment may be affected by my article.
('41', 170, 9, 20, 337029) But in her article in Liberty she has outdone herself.
('41', 170, 9, 21, 337084) Her reference to my secretaries is a clever attempt to hoodwink the unwary reader.
('41', 170, 9, 22, 337167) All that could be inferred from my repudiation of the statement that I had two secretaries (whether always or not is not the point) is that Miss Mayo was at least a careless writer if not a wilful perverter of truth.
('41', 170, 9, 23, 337384) But the manner in which she

('41', 171, 1, 2, 337734) described the secretaries leaves the reader under the belief that I have always two secretaries.
('41', 171, 1, 3, 337831) Her adherence to the statement that I did give her the message she ascribed to me proves her to be guilty of a gross suppression of truth.
('41', 171, 1, 4, 337970) She seems to have thought that I would not have a copy of the corrected interview between her and me.
('41', 171, 1, 5, 338072) Unfortunately for her I happen to possess a copy of her notes.
('41', 171, 1, 6, 338135) Here is the full quotation referring to the hum of the wheel:
('41', 171, 2, 7, 338197) My message to America is simply the hum of this wheel.
('41', 171, 2, 8, 338252) Letters and newspaper cuttings I get from America show that one set of people overrates the results of non violent non co operation and the other not only underrates it, but imputes all kinds of motives to those who are concerned with the movement.
('41', 171, 2, 9, 338501) Dont exaggerate one way or the other.
('41', 171, 2, 10, 338539) If, therefore, some earnest Americans will study the movement impartially and patiently, then it is likely that the United States may know something of the movement which I do consider to be unique although I am the author of it.
('41', 171, 2, 11, 338769) What I mean is that our movement is summed up in the spinning wheel with all its implications.
('41', 171, 2, 12, 338864) It is to me a substitute for gunpowder.
('41', 171, 2, 13, 338904) For it brings the message of self reliance and hope to the millions of India.
('41', 171, 2, 14, 338982) And when they are really awakened, they would not need to lift their little finger in order to regain their freedom.
('41', 171, 2, 15, 339099) The message of the spinning wheel is, really, to replace the spirit of exploitation by the spirit of service.
('41', 171, 2, 16, 339209) The dominant not in the West is the note of exploi tation.
('41', 171, 2, 17, 339268) I have no desire that my country should copy that spirit or that note.
('41', 171, 2, 18, 339339) The first sentence only of the foregoing extract, which Miss Mayo quotes without the most important commentary on it, is intended to ridicule me.
('41', 171, 2, 19, 339485) But the whole paragraph, I hope, makes my meaning and message clear and intelligible.
('41', 171, 2, 20, 339571) I wrote my article on her book whilst I was travelling.
('41', 171, 2, 21, 339627) Had I had the notes before me, I should have quoted from them, and thus added force to my article.
('41', 171, 2, 22, 339726) I claim, however, that the message as it appears in the full paragraph quoted is not different from what I have stated in the article Miss Mayo attempts to shake.
('41', 171, 2, 23, 339889) Whilst, therefore, even in the trivial quibble as she rightly calls the subject matter of her contradiction, she is, I trust, proved wholly unsuccessful, I claim that even if my memory had betrayed me, my conclusive reply to her is left unanswered and untouched.
('41', 171, 2, 24, 340152) Having no case, she has followed the method of the pettifogging lawyer who vainly tries to discredit a hostile but unshakable witness by making him state things from memory which might be found on

('41', 172, 1, 2, 340391) verfication to be not quite accurate.
('41', 172, 1, 3, 340429) It gives me pain to have to say that her article in Liberty proves her to be not only an unreliable writer, but an unscrupulous person devoid of sense of right and wrong.

('41', 172, 3, 5, 340622) 188. GUJARAT VIDYAPITH
('41', 172, 4, 6, 340645) This National University, the first of its kind established when non co operation was at its height, has been struggling for existence for the past three or four years.
('41', 172, 4, 7, 340814) The attendance of boys has gone down considerably.
('41', 172, 4, 8, 340865) Several schools affiliated to it have closed or sought Government recognition.
('41', 172, 4, 9, 340944) There would be nothing to worry over this decline, if there were no internal causes for it.
('41', 172, 4, 10, 341036) But most of us including myself have felt that we have not done all we might have for this most useful national work of reconstruction.
('41', 172, 4, 11, 341172) But whilst, if all had been vigilant, the defections might have been not so large as they have been, there are for the decline causes over which no one had any control.
('41', 172, 4, 12, 341341) And though the quality of the work already done might have been easily better, what has been achieved is such as any institution would be proud of.
('41', 172, 4, 13, 341489) I make bold to assert that but for the Vidyapith, Vallabhbhai Patel would not have been able to command the valuable assistance he did of so many workers during the late disastrous floods 1. Indeed, the Vidyapith volunteers went even to Sind in order to assist Professor Malkani who has been doing heroic work there in connection with the Sind floods.
('41', 172, 4, 14, 341841) I hope some day to deal the Vidyapith graduates work of which an accurate but brief analysis has been prepared by a graduate proud of being owned by it.
('41', 172, 4, 15, 341994) Sufficient for the time being to make the confession of our neglect both avoidable and unavoidable and to state that we seem now to have been roused from our slumbers.
('41', 172, 4, 16, 342162) The preliminary cleansing step was taken on Sunday 2 last when the Senate handed over charge of the valuable property and the still more valuable responsibility connected with the Vidyapith to a Board of Trustees by means of a resolution of which I give the translation below:

('41', 173, 0, 1, 342485) 174 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 173, 1, 2, 342527) This meeting of the Senate of the Gujarat Vidyapith is of opinion that 1. By having established the Gujarat Vidyapith in connection with the non co operation movement and by maintaining it in spite of a set back in the movement, Gujarat has rendered essential service to the nation.
('41', 173, 1, 3, 342810) 2. The Vidyapith has however continued year after year to suffer in point of numbers.
('41', 173, 1, 4, 342896) 3. The Vidyapith could have achieved better results in point of quality, had the internal conditions been favourable; and, 4. The Vidyapith has now reached a stage in its evolution, when, in order to make it work more effectively and in order to ensure an unswerving observance of the principles hereinafter enunciated, the administration of the Vidyapith should be entrusted to a Board of Trustees.
('41', 173, 1, 5, 343296) 5. Therefore, and in pursuance of the resolution for the reconstruction of the Vidyapith passed by this Senate on the 4th of December 1927, the Senate appoints a Board of Trustees called the Gujarat Vidyapith Mandal to be composed of those who, from the list herein below, pledge themselves to subscribe to and observe the principles hereinafter enunciated; hands over charge of all the institutions connected with the Vidyapith, along with their property, movable and immovable, as also all the rights and responsibilities pertaining thereto, to the said Vidyapith Mandal; and authorizes the Mandal to add to its membership subject to the same qualifications so as not to exceed 25; and authorizes it to exercise all other rights including that of filling vacancies caused by resignation, death, or dismissal of any member for breach of the pledge or similar other reason, the latter to take place by a vote of four fifths of their number.

('41', 174, 2, 3, 344734) PRINCIPLE 1. The principal object of the Vidyapith shall be to prepare workers of character, ability, education and conscientiousness, necessary for the conduct of the movements connected with the attainment of swaraj.
('41', 174, 2, 4, 344953) 2. All the institutions conducted by and affiliated to the Vidyapith shall be fully non co operating and shall therefore have nothing to do with any help from Government.
('41', 174, 2, 5, 345124) 3. Whereas the Vidyapith has come into being in connection with swaraj, and non violent non co operation as a means thereof, its teachers and trustees shall restrict themselves to those means only which are not inconsistent with truth and non violence and shall consciously strive to carry them out.
('41', 174, 2, 6, 345424) 4. The teachers and the trustees of the Vidyapith, as also all the institutions affiliated to it, shall regard untouchability as a blot on Hinduism, shall strive to the best of their power for its removal, and shall not exclude a boy or girl for reason of his or her untouchability nor shall give him or her differential treatment having once accorded admission to him or her.
('41', 174, 2, 7, 345801) 5. The teachers and the trustees of and all the institutions affiliated to the Vidyapith shall regard hand spinning as an essential part of the swaraj movement and shall therefore spin regularly, except when disabled, and shall habitually wear khadi.
('41', 174, 2, 8, 346052) 6. The language of the Province shall have the principal place in the Vidyapith and shall be the medium of instruction.
('41', 174, 2, 9, 346172) EXPLANATION.
('41', 174, 2, 10, 346185) Languages other than Gujarati may be taught by direct method.
('41', 175, 0, 1, 346247) 176 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 175, 1, 2, 346289) 7. The teaching of Hindi Hindustani shall be compulsory in the curricula of the Vidyapith.
('41', 175, 1, 3, 346380) 8. Manual training shall receive the same importance as intellectual training and only such occupations as are useful for the life of the nation shall be taught.
('41', 175, 1, 4, 346542) 9. Whereas the growth of the nation depends not on cities but its villages, the bulk of the funds of the Vidyapith and a majority of the teachers of the Vidyapith shall be employed in the propagation of education conducive to the welfare of the villagers.
('41', 175, 1, 5, 346798) 10. In laying down the curricula, the needs of village dwellers shall have principal consideration.
('41', 175, 1, 6, 346898) 11. There shall be complete toleration of all established religions in all institutions conducted by and affiliated to the Vidyapith, and for the spiritual development of the pupils, religious instruction shall be imparted in consonance with truth and non violence.
('41', 175, 1, 7, 347164) 12. For the physical development of the nation, physical exercise and physical training shall be compulsory in all the institutions conducted by and affiliated to the Vidyapith.
('41', 175, 1, 8, 347342) Hindi Hindustani means the language commonly spoken by the masses of the North, both Hindu and Mussalman, written in the Devanagari or the Persian script.
('41', 175, 1, 9, 347497) But drastic as this step is, it may mean nothing if it is not to be followed up by quick, persistent and vigilant effort.
('41', 175, 1, 10, 347619) Such effort may for the time being even result in further defections.
('41', 175, 1, 11, 347689) The Senate, now the Board of Trustees, have been quite aware of the possibility.
('41', 175, 1, 12, 347770) They want quality and feel that if the quality is assured, quantity will come in its own time.
('41', 175, 1, 13, 347865) They are prepared to sacrifice everything to quality.
('41', 175, 1, 14, 347919) It would be wrong to use donations of those who have given and will give in the belief that the principles for which the institution has professed to stand will be worked out in practice in so far as it is humanly possible.
('41', 175, 1, 15, 348143) As reformers the trustees would belie their trust if they sacrifice principles for holding the institution together anyhow.
('41', 175, 1, 16, 348267) Personally I have no fear as to the result if the trustees remain staunch, as I have every reason to believe they will.
('41', 175, 1, 17, 348387) On the surface there wold appear to be a descent from demo cracy to oligarchy.
('41', 175, 1, 18, 348466) As a matter of fact it is not.
('41', 175, 1, 19, 348497) The large elected body could not be sustained when the principles for which the elected
('41', 176, 0, 1, 348585) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 177
('41', 176, 1, 2, 348627) Senate for the time being stood were in the melting pot.
('41', 176, 1, 3, 348684) A democracys ideals and principles vary with the times.
('41', 176, 1, 4, 348740) A refor mers principles are rigid and fixed.
('41', 176, 1, 5, 348785) When non co operation ceased to be national, those who believed in it as a creed, the only final solution for the removal of Indias fetters, were bound to save the creed by working it to its logical conclusion in their own lives.
('41', 176, 1, 6, 349015) Hence did the Congress bring into being an independent self governing body styled the All India Spinners Association, composed of those who had a living faith in the message of the wheel.
('41', 176, 1, 7, 349203) The unwritten understanding was that the Association would work out the programme of khadi so as to become in process of time a tower of strength to the parent body.
('41', 176, 1, 8, 349369) The permanent trust has been created in the hope of evolving a truly democratic institution.
('41', 176, 1, 9, 349462) And there is a democracy such as the world had never seen if khadi becomes a truly national institution.
('41', 176, 1, 10, 349567) Even so has the Senate emerged as a Board of Trustees pledged to work out its present ideals so as to make national education a living force, so as, that is to say, to cover every village in Gujarat, to enable the students to realize the dignity of labour equally with the dignity of learning, to produce national servants who will serve the nation in her villages.
('41', 176, 1, 11, 349933) The Senate, when after a full discussion it came to the resolution on Sunday, has no less, a hope, the Trustees shouldered no less a responsibility.
('41', 176, 1, 12, 350082) No oligarchy can arise from a voluntary surrender such as the Senates was.
('41', 176, 1, 13, 350157) It gave up its powers to a permanent body when it was in posession of the fullest powers and in a position to exercise them to the fullest extent.
('41', 176, 1, 14, 350304) It was an act of self denial whose virtue has to be proved by the Trustees.
('41', 176, 1, 15, 350380) Theirs is an awful responsibility.
('41', 176, 1, 16, 350415) But, with proper consecration, it will sit lightly on their shoulders and Gujarat as well as India will be the gainer thereby.
('41', 176, 1, 17, 350542) They will be judged not by the quantity of result turned out but by the quantity and the quality of self service put in.

('41', 185, 1, 2, 362831) 204. AFTER HARTAL?
('41', 185, 2, 3, 362850) With great deliberation and not without the exercise of great self restraint have I hitherto refrained practically from writing anything about the boycott of the Statutory Commission.
('41', 185, 2, 4, 363034) I recognized the force of the appeal made to me by the Leader of Allahabad not to meddle with or influence the boycott movement, but to let the various parties manage it themselves.
('41', 185, 2, 5, 363216) I recognized that my interference was bound to bring in the masses more prominently into the movement and might possibly embarrass the promoters.
('41', 185, 2, 6, 363362) Now that the great demonstration is over, I feel free to say a word.
('41', 185, 2, 7, 363431) I tender my congr atulations to the organizers for the very great success they achieved on the hartal day 1. It did my soul good to see Liberals, Independents and Congressmen ranged together on the same platform.
('41', 185, 2, 8, 363644) I could not but admire the courage of the students of Government colleges in absenting themselves from their colleges for the sake of the national cause.
('41', 185, 2, 9, 363798) All the world over students are playing a most important and effective part in shaping and strengthening national movements.
('41', 185, 2, 10, 363923) It would be monstrous if the students of India did less.
('41', 185, 2, 11, 363980) My object now is to draw attention to the fact that the very success of the hartal will be turned against us if it is not followed up by sufficient and persistent action.
('41', 185, 2, 12, 364151) We must belie the prophecy of Lord Sinha that the hartal was but a passing cloud.
('41', 185, 2, 13, 364233) Let us bear in mind that, notwithstanding our opposition, the Commission, backed as it is by British bayonets, will go its own way.
('41', 185, 2, 14, 364365) Where it cannot get bona fide recognition, it will be manufactured for it.
('41', 185, 2, 15, 364440) Did not a so called deputation on behalf of untouchables welcome the Commi ssion as its true deliverers?
('41', 185, 2, 16, 364545) Claiming to know the untouchables more than the members of the deputation, I make bold to assert that they no more represented the untouchables than would a party of Japanese, for instance.
('41', 185, 2, 17, 364735) If then we are to ensure a complete boycott, not only will there have to be a joint organization by all the parties for carrying it out and possibly picketing, wherever the Commission goes, but there must be some further demonstration of the nations strength.
('41', 185, 2, 18, 364995) Even though mine may be a voice in the wilderness and even at the risk of repeating a thousandth time the same old story, I suggest that there is

('41', 186, 1, 2, 365202) nothing before the nation other than boycott of foreign cloth which can be brought about effectively and quickly.
('41', 186, 1, 3, 365316) But like all great undertakings, it requires planning and organizing.
('41', 186, 1, 4, 365386) It requires sustained and vigilant effort by a party of earnest, able and honest men and women exclusively devoted to the task.
('41', 186, 1, 5, 365514) It is not an easy task.
('41', 186, 1, 6, 365538) If it was, it would not produce the great results that are promised for it.
('41', 186, 1, 7, 365614) It must evoke the best in the nation, before it is accomplished.
('41', 186, 1, 8, 365679) But let us also frankly recognize that if we cannot organize this one thing, we shall organize nothing else.
('41', 186, 1, 9, 365788) Let me make my own position clear.
('41', 186, 1, 10, 365823) I have no desire even now to interfere with the present evolution of the national movement except through occasional writings.
('41', 186, 1, 11, 365950) This is written, therefore, by way of a humble appeal to the different parties who are jointly acting in order to vindicate national honour.

('41', 186, 4, 15, 366191) Srinivasa Sastri the social status of our countrymen in South Africa has undoubtedly improved and life is becoming less unbearable for self respecting Indians, reminders come now and then from that sub continent that much yet remains to be done before the Indian settlers enjoy the ordinary civic rights and feel their position safe.
('41', 186, 4, 16, 366525) The latest shock comes through a cable just received from Mr. Albert Christopher, the new Deputy President of the South African Indian Congress.
('41', 186, 4, 17, 366670) Mr. Christopher was one of the volunteers who served as well during the Boer War as during the late War.
('41', 186, 4, 18, 366775) He is South Africa born and has just returned after finishing his education in England.
('41', 186, 4, 19, 366863) The cable runs as follows:
('41', 186, 5, 20, 366890) Second reading Liquor Bill now going through Parliament notwithstanding strong protest.
('41', 186, 5, 21, 366978) Bill seeks deprive three thousand Indians their families and dependents of livelihood ultimately drive them out of country.
('41', 186, 5, 22, 367102) Bill direct conflict letter spirit Cape Town Agreement.
('41', 186, 5, 23, 367158) Clear racial legislation.
('41', 186, 5, 24, 367184) Indians greatly alarmed Governments attitude.
('41', 186, 5, 25, 367230) If Bill passes Cape Town Agreement smashed.
('41', 186, 5, 26, 367274) Earnestly appeal your immediate interven tion.
('41', 186, 5, 27, 367321) Even the respectable South African Press agrees with the opinion of the South African Congress that the Bill violates the
('41', 187, 0, 1, 367443) 188 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 187, 1, 2, 367485) Agreement which resulted from the Round Table Conference.
('41', 187, 1, 3, 367543) That it is aimed even at those who are already earning an honest livelihood in hotels and bars is unquestioned.
('41', 187, 1, 4, 367655) If the Union Parliament persists in the Bill, it simply means that being the stronger party to the contract, it can safely commit breach of contract whenever it wills.
('41', 187, 1, 5, 367823) Our hope lies in Sjt.
('41', 187, 1, 6, 367845) Sastris gentle diplomacy saving not only the situation, but the honour of the Union Government, the Union Parliament and the white people of South Africa in spite of themselves.
('41', 187, 1, 7, 368023) He, however, needs energetic support from the Indian Press and the Indian public.
('41', 187, 2, 8, 368105) A PARALLEL FROM CHINA A friend sends me a cutting from the New York Times containing the report of an interview with Mr. Ku Hung Ming, one of the most prominent Chinese, referring to the cultural greatness of the Chinese people and its being belittled by foreigners.
('41', 187, 2, 9, 368372) And referring to the inroads of foreign merchants upon China, Mr. Ku says:
('41', 187, 3, 10, 368447) I was similarly blind when I first returned from my long years abroad, he admits with disarming frankness.
('41', 187, 3, 11, 368554) At first I was ashamed to admit I was Chinese; now I am so proud of my heritage that I am conceited enough to think the rest of you are all barbarians.
('41', 187, 4, 12, 368706) You see, our main trouble is economic.
('41', 187, 4, 13, 368745) You Americans, for instance, thought a great influx of Chinese labourers would upset your industry and lower your standard of living.
('41', 187, 4, 14, 368879) You acted promptly and shut your door against Chinese.
('41', 187, 5, 15, 368934) But we in China have suffered an invasion of your foreign machines and of cheap machine made goods, and those things have ruined us, just [as] an influx of several million Chinese coolie labourers would have ruined your industrial scheme.
('41', 187, 6, 16, 369173) When I was a young man, for instance, even the women in our own families spun and wove.
('41', 187, 6, 17, 369261) At the time fully 100,000,000 Chinese women spun and wove.
('41', 187, 6, 18, 369320) Then came cheap foreign cotton goods and these 100,000,000 women have no productive life, but must live on the labours of their menfolk.
('41', 187, 6, 19, 369457) We are prevented from following your example of shutting the door by the fact that the treaties forbid our taking any action.
('41', 187, 6, 20, 369583) We do not have even tariff autonomy.
('41', 187, 7, 21, 369620) If I were an artist, I would draw you a cartoon which would show you what I think of the unequal treaties.
('41', 187, 8, 22, 369727) Picture a Chinese prone upon the ground and a foreigner standing over him holding him down with his foot.
('41', 187, 8, 23, 369833) Get up, say the foreigner.
('41', 187, 8, 24, 369860) Take your foot off first, says the Chinese.
('41', 187, 8, 25, 369904) No, you get up first, says the foreigner,

('41', 188, 4, 14, 371355) But it is safe not to build hopes on any fixed season.
('41', 188, 4, 15, 371410) Sufficient for me to give the assurance that I would like to tour in these and the remaining province at an early date, if it is at all possible.

('41', 189, 3, 7, 372480) DEAR DR.
('41', 189, 3, 8, 372489) ANSARI, Dont you worry about my health.
('41', 189, 3, 9, 372529) Doctors will frighten one.
('41', 189, 3, 10, 372556) This time the registered blood pressure does not seem to produce any impression on me.
('41', 189, 3, 11, 372643) I am keeping fairly [fit].
('41', 189, 3, 12, 372670) I have strength to walk, and I only lie on my back because doctors are impera tive and tell me that some blood pressure cases are most illusive and specially dangerous when the patient himself feels no visible effects.
('41', 189, 3, 13, 372889) This letter I am dictating in connection with Ajmal Jamia Fund.
('41', 189, 3, 14, 372953) Whilst you are in the midst of all the big people, I want you to buttonhole them and get them to subscribe, no matter how much.
('41', 189, 3, 15, 373081) I fear that there will be little spontaneous response or it will come when noted men and women have subscribed.
('41', 189, 3, 16, 373193) If I had not become bedridden, I would have done lobbying this side of India.
('41', 189, 3, 17, 373271) And I have not yet lost hope of being able to do it.
('41', 189, 3, 18, 373324) I am not at all sure of your scheme of deputations going round succeeding.
('41', 189, 3, 19, 373399) I know it is cruel to ask you to spare the time when it is occupied between your practice and direct Congress work.
('41', 189, 3, 20, 373515) But you have got to find it for this work too.
('41', 189, 3, 21, 373562) If you have not seen my article After Hartal? 1, please look at it.
('41', 189, 3, 22, 373630) Unless you take up this universal and possible thing, boycott of foreign cloth, the energy created by the boycott of the Statutory Commission will be all waste of effort.
('41', 189, 3, 23, 373801) Every negative action without corresponding positive action becomes useless in the end.

('41', 190, 3, 6, 374274) But I am obeying the doctors as far as it is possible.
('41', 190, 3, 7, 374329) I had your telegram.

('41', 190, 8, 18, 374841) But I was more than pleased to have your own letter and to know that you were on the road to complete recovery and that you were able yourself to write long letters.
('41', 190, 8, 19, 375007) Yes, the violence during the Madras hartal was most unfortunate.
('41', 190, 8, 20, 375072) The slightest relaxation of control precipitates violence.
('41', 190, 8, 21, 375131) I had a letter from Mr. Runham Brown.
('41', 190, 8, 22, 375169) I sent a reply saying that I would not be able to go.
('41', 190, 8, 23, 375223) I still feel that my work outside is also better done from the Indian platform.
('41', 190, 8, 24, 375303) It can be said of it that it is still in too experimental a stage to make any confident claim about it, and if anything definite can be said about it with complete confidence, it would be itself a very striking object lesson in no war.
('41', 190, 8, 25, 375539) But I am keeping both the letters for reconsideration.
('41', 190, 8, 26, 375594) I shall watch also how the blood pressure behaves, and if I find meanwhile any prompting from the inner voice in the direction of going, I shall not hesitate to say yes.

('41', 192, 9, 17, 377991) Government will fight you with the help of your own money and recover the increment in a moment.
('41', 192, 9, 18, 378088) No assessment can be paid until the increment is cancelled, and you must plainly say to Government: Declare the enhancement cancelled and then take the old assessment which we are prepared to pay. Are the people prepared to take up this attitude?
('41', 192, 10, 19, 378335) K. I am not quite sure about the bigger places like Bardoli or Valod, for the Vanias in these places are naturally afraid that Government might deprive them of their lands and transfer them to their original occupants, the Raniparaj people.
('41', 192, 10, 20, 378576) But the other villages are quite solid.
('41', 192, 11, 21, 378616) G. Thats all right.
('41', 192, 11, 22, 378636) But is their cause just and their case unassailable?
('41', 192, 12, 23, 378689) KALYANJI: Certainly.
('41', 192, 12, 24, 378710) Naraharibhai has demonstrated it in his articles.
('41', 192, 13, 25, 378760) G. I do not know.
('41', 192, 13, 26, 378778) I have not read the articles with care.
('41', 192, 13, 27, 378818) But remember that you will have to keep the whole country with you, and

('41', 193, 1, 3, 379132) Then there is another point.
('41', 193, 1, 4, 379161) The people may be ready to fight.

('41', 193, 3, 10, 379430) Vallabhbhai had just arrived.
('41', 193, 3, 11, 379460) He said he had studied the case and had no doubt that the cause was just.

('41', 193, 5, 18, 379815) I seem to be gaining groundso the doctors think.
('41', 193, 5, 19, 379864) Personally I feel I have not lost any.
('41', 193, 5, 20, 379903) Of course I did lose weight, but then I did so with my eyes open.
('41', 193, 5, 21, 379969) I could not conduct the difficult experiment of reverting to fruits and nuts without having to lose weight.
('41', 193, 5, 22, 380077) But I am now conducting it under better auspices and with doctors watching.
('41', 193, 5, 23, 380153) So this little collapse is perhaps an advantage and it has imposed upon me a rest which perhaps I needed.
('41', 193, 5, 24, 380259) I note the correction in the date about the spinning in Sind.

('41', 194, 1, 3, 380780) And now the cold weather on this side of India is practically over.
('41', 194, 1, 4, 380848) We are having hot afternoons already and I wonder whether you can stand the summer of Sabarmati.
('41', 194, 1, 5, 380945) Temperature goes up sometimes to 112, even 115. Sabarmati is not very far from Jacobabad, the hottest place in India.
('41', 194, 1, 6, 381063) Why not reproduce wherever you are the ideals for which the Ashram stands?
('41', 194, 1, 7, 381138) Then you have the Ashram without its obvious limitations, and you can add to or modify the ideals as much as you like.

('41', 194, 5, 13, 381464) There need be no anxiety about my health.
('41', 194, 5, 14, 381506) So long as God wants some work through this body, it will stand all trials and tests.
('41', 194, 5, 15, 381592) I am obeying doctors fully and taking complete rest, though personally I do not seem to feel the want of it.
('41', 194, 5, 16, 381701) I know that you will come whenever I want you, however pressing your other engagements may be.
('41', 194, 5, 17, 381796) The thought that there are friends realy to help me is itself a great consolution.
('41', 194, 5, 18, 381879) At the present moment there are enough nurse friends about me.
('41', 194, 5, 19, 381942) I seem to, and doctors too, think that I am making steady progress.

('41', 195, 2, 3, 382169) DEAR FRIEND, Mira has translated your latest letter for me.
('41', 195, 2, 4, 382229) My whole soul goes out to you in your grief especially because it comes over a letter which makes you suspect me of hardness of heart.
('41', 195, 2, 5, 382364) I appreciate your desire to find me correct in all I do and think.
('41', 195, 2, 6, 382431) I do indeed want to stand well with you, but I must be true to myself if I am to continue to deserve your warm friendship.
('41', 195, 2, 7, 382554) Let me first tell you that Miras letter reflected her own views though they were found to coincide with mine.
('41', 195, 2, 8, 382664) Neither Mira, so far as I know her, nor I had the remotest idea of judging those two good peasants.
('41', 195, 2, 9, 382764) 1 Their action was undoubtedly one of heroism.
('41', 195, 2, 10, 382811) What we had in our minds was the heroism of a war resister, and from the record sent by you and as it was interpreted to me by Mira, I missed that particular type of heroism which a war resister demonstrates in his own life.
('41', 195, 2, 11, 383036) Joan of Arc was a heroine.
('41', 195, 2, 12, 383063) So were Leonidas and Horatius.
('41', 195, 2, 13, 383094) But the heroism in each case was of a different type, each noble and admirable in its own sphere.
('41', 195, 2, 14, 383192) In the answers given by the peasants, I do not notice any definite repugnance to war as war and a determination to suffer to the uttermost in their resistance to war.
('41', 195, 2, 15, 383359) These peasant friends, if my recollection serves me right, are heroes representing and defending the simple rustic life.
('41', 195, 2, 16, 383480) These heroes are no less precious than those of a militant war resister type.
('41', 195, 2, 17, 383558) We want to treasure all this heroism, but what I feel is that we will serve the heroes and the cause of truth better if we treated each type separately.
('41', 195, 2, 18, 383711) You have curiously raised the question of my participation in the late War.
('41', 195, 2, 19, 383787) 2 It is a legitimate question.
('41', 195, 2, 20, 383818) I had answered it in the last autobiographical chapter as if in anticipation of your question.
('41', 195, 2, 21, 383913) Please read it carefully and tell me at your leisure what you think of the

('41', 196, 1, 5, 384649) Who knows in how many places I must be guilty of hardness of heart, and I should not be surprised if you have noticed want of charity in my writings in more places than one.

('41', 196, 1, 7, 384918) I suppose it was not without reason that the early Christians considered Satan to be not merely an evil principle but evil incarnate.
('41', 196, 1, 8, 385052) He seems to dominate us in every walk of life and mans mission is to overthrow him from power.
('41', 196, 1, 9, 385147) This letter of yours to Mira makes me more and more anxious to see you in the flesh, and there is just a distant hope of my being able to do so this year if I keep good health and if otherwise the inner voice guides me towards Europe.
('41', 196, 1, 10, 385382) I am seriously considering two invitations, and the desire to meet you may precipitate my decision in favour of accepting those invitations.

('41', 197, 5, 8, 386336) What happened to the students during the Rowlatt Act agitation is repeating itself now.
('41', 197, 5, 9, 386424) During those precious days, one of them wrote to me that he felt like committing suicide because he was rusticated.
('41', 197, 5, 10, 386540) A student now writes:
('41', 197, 6, 11, 386562) The students of.
('41', 197, 6, 12, 386579) heard the mothers call and responded to it.
('41', 197, 6, 13, 386623) We observed hartal on the 3rd.
('41', 197, 6, 14, 386654) For this courageous deed of ours, we are being fined Rs. 2 per head.
('41', 197, 6, 15, 386723) The poor students are losing their freeships, half freeships and scholarships.
('41', 197, 6, 16, 386802) Please write to Mr. .
('41', 197, 6, 17, 386824) the Principal, or advise him through Young India.
('41', 197, 6, 18, 386874) Tell him we are no criminals, we have committed no crime.
('41', 197, 6, 19, 386932) Tell him we listened and responded to the mothers call, we saved her, to our utmost, from dishonour.
('41', 197, 6, 20, 387033) Tell him we are no cowards.
('41', 197, 6, 21, 387061) Please come forward to our aid.
('41', 197, 6, 22, 387093) I cannot follow the advice to write the Principal.
('41', 197, 6, 23, 387144) If he is not to lose his job, I suppose he has to take some disciplinary measures.
('41', 197, 6, 24, 387227) So long as educational institutions remain under the partronage of the Government, they will be, as they must be, used for the support of the Government, and the students or the teachers who support anti Government popular measures must count the cost and take the risk of being dismissed.
('41', 197, 6, 25, 387517) From the patriots standpoint, the students did well and braverly in making common cause with the people.
('41', 197, 6, 26, 387622) They would have laid themselves open to the charge of want of patriotism, if not wrose, if they had not responded to countrys call.
('41', 197, 6, 27, 387754) From the Government standpoint, they undoubtedly did wrong and incurred their severe displeasure.
('41', 197, 6, 28, 387852) The students cannot blow hot and cold.
('41', 197, 6, 29, 387891) If they will be with the peoples cause, they must hold their scholastic

('41', 198, 1, 2, 388093) career sub servient to the cause and sacrifice it when it comes in conflict with the interest of the country.
('41', 198, 1, 3, 388203) I saw this quite clearly in 1920 and subsequent experience has confirmed the first impression There in no doubt that the safest and the most honourable course for the student world is to leave Government schools and colleges at any cost.
('41', 198, 1, 4, 388441) But the next best course for them is to hold themselves in readiness to be thrown out whenever a conflict occurs between the Government and the people.
('41', 198, 1, 5, 388593) If they will not be, as they have been elsewhere, leaders themselves in the revolt against the Government, they must at least become staunch and true followers.
('41', 198, 1, 6, 388754) Let their facing of the consequences be as was their response to the nations call.
('41', 198, 1, 7, 388837) Let them not humiliate themselves, let them not surrender their self respect in trying to re enter colleges and schools from which they may have been dismissed.
('41', 198, 1, 8, 388998) The bravery of their response will be counted as bravado, if it succumbs on the very first trial.
('41', 198, 1, 9, 389096) I hear that, during the days preceding the hartal, the students discarded foreign cloth and very largely patronized khadi.
('41', 198, 1, 10, 389219) Let it not be said of them that this was but a passing show and that they have, on pressure from without or temptation from within, discarded khadi as quickly as they discarded foreign cloth.
('41', 198, 1, 11, 389411) To me foreign cloth for this country means foreign Government.
('41', 198, 1, 12, 389474) I wish this was accepted as a self evident proposition.

('41', 198, 4, 15, 389568) It is a matter of great sorrow to me that my health should cause anxiety to many friends.
('41', 198, 4, 16, 389658) Hitherto I have allowed Mahadev Desai, subject to censorship, to write whatever he has wished about my health, seeing that the break downs, important or unimportant, occurred whilst I was travelling, and were supposed to be due to fatigue, and because those who were in charge of me during the travels had a responsibility about my bodily condition.
('41', 198, 4, 17, 390008) But circumstances have now altered.
('41', 198, 4, 18, 390044) I am having a respite from travels and onerous public duties.
('41', 198, 4, 19, 390106) I am taking part only to the extent that I wish in reorganizing some of the activities in Gujarat, specially educational, for which I am perhaps predominantly responsible.
('41', 198, 4, 20, 390278) I have, therefore, felt called upon to take up what has been a hobby of a lifetime, namely, dietetic experiments.
('41', 198, 4, 21, 390392) They are to me as important as many of the most important activities which have engrossed me from time to time, and it was in the course
('41', 199, 0, 1, 390529) 200 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 199, 1, 2, 390571) of these experiments that the present so called break down has occurred.
('41', 199, 1, 3, 390644) The alarming registrations of doctors instruments have had no reponse in my own feeling.
('41', 199, 1, 4, 390733) But I have accepted the statement of medical friends that very often blood pressure patients feel no evil effects, although they may be stealthily present in the body and must, therefore, be guarded against.
('41', 199, 1, 5, 390941) Happily, however, even these instruments registered last Sunday a very great improvement, a fall from 214mm.
('41', 199, 1, 6, 391050) systolic to 178mm.
('41', 199, 1, 7, 391069) and a rise from 120mm.
('41', 199, 1, 8, 391092) [sic] diastolic to 118mm.
('41', 199, 1, 9, 391118) I am also taking the rest prescribed by Dr. Haribhai Desai and his medical companions, and carrying on my dietetic experiments under their observations and guidance.
('41', 199, 1, 10, 391284) Dr. Muthu who seems to have made special study of dietetics is also kindly guiding me by correspondence.
('41', 199, 1, 11, 391389) Having given all this information, I would implore newspaper correspondents to curb their pen and kindly to forget me and my health for the time being.
('41', 199, 1, 12, 391541) And I would ask anxious friends not to worry about my health, accepting my assurance that I am in no hurry to die and that, therefore, I shall be taking all the care of my body that is humanly possible for me, and is consistent with the ideals to which the body is dedicated and which I hold to be more precious than the body.
('41', 199, 1, 13, 391868) Let the friends rest assured that, if the nation has any use for this body of mine, it is because a serious attempt has been made for many a long year to hold it in trust for those ideals.
('41', 199, 1, 14, 392057) I would ask them also the share my belief, which I hold even at the risk of being dubbed a fatalist, that not one hair of anyones body can be touched without His will and that when He has no use for our bodies, He defies all the care, attention and skill that money, prestige, patriotism, friendship and what not can summon to ones assistance.
('41', 199, 1, 15, 392401) This belief does not mean that I do not want to take advantage of the assistance that medical friends all over India ungrudgingly and most generously render to me.
('41', 199, 1, 16, 392565) I take that assistance gladly and faithfully.
('41', 199, 1, 17, 392611) For God has given me no inkling of His intentions, but He has imposed upon me the duty of taking care of the body consistently with other more imperative obligations which, in my opinion, He has imposed upon me in common with the rest of humanity.

('41', 200, 1, 2, 392924) 219. FLOOD RELIEF WORK IN SIND I gladly publish the following first instalment 1 of notes by Prof.
('41', 200, 1, 3, 393023) N. R. Malkani about the distress in Sind which was truly no less acute than in Gujarat.
('41', 200, 1, 4, 393111) But as I have already remarked before, Gujarat attracted the widest attention not merely because of its being the store house of Indias donors, but also, and perhaps more, because it found an army of workers under Vallabhbhai Patel ready and determined to handle and organize the task of relieving distress.
('41', 200, 1, 5, 393419) Sind no less than Orissa suffered because they could not produce such an organization.
('41', 200, 1, 6, 393506) But no lack of organization can be allowed to excuse any avoidable misery.
('41', 200, 1, 7, 393581) The public should know that Prof.
('41', 200, 1, 8, 393615) Malkani is himself personally organizing the relief operations under the supervision of the Central Committee which, I hope, is giving him all the assistance he may need.

('41', 200, 2, 11, 393931) Unfortunately for me, I am responsible for the phrase blot on Hinduism, notwithstanding my claim, often repudiated I know, to be a sanatani Hindu.
('41', 200, 2, 12, 394078) If the institution of war, in spite of its being contrary to the spirit of the Christian teaching, may be said to be a blot upon Christianity because war is universal in Christendom, untouchability may safely be regarded as a blot Hinduism in spite of the contention of a growing number of Hindus that untouchability has no place in true Hinduism.
('41', 200, 2, 13, 394426) If the expression pains some Hindus, it is a healthy sign.
('41', 200, 2, 14, 394485) When it pains the majority of Hindus and they repudiate the charge, there will be no occasion to repeat it.
('41', 200, 2, 15, 394593) And if it is a blot, why may not a Mussalman who believed in the truth and purity of Hinduism hold with his Hindu co member that it is a blot ?

('41', 200, 3, 20, 395033) He had suggested that it could be changed to blot on humanity or deleted altogether.

('41', 201, 2, 3, 395194) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 18, 1928
('41', 201, 3, 4, 395235) MY DEAR C. R., Herewith Kelappans letter.
('41', 201, 3, 5, 395277) I have asked him to discuss his scheme with you.
('41', 201, 3, 6, 395326) Whatever you think is feasible should be done.
('41', 201, 3, 7, 395373) You will not hesitate to sanction anything for fear of funds being exhausted.
('41', 201, 3, 8, 395451) All I am anxious about is that whatever work is done is substantial and honest.
('41', 201, 3, 9, 395531) I hope you are now not worrying about my health.
('41', 201, 3, 10, 395580) I have not yet taken any vow about the milk and I am not going to do anything unless I find the experiment to be absolutely successful.
('41', 201, 3, 11, 395716) And not only I am carefully watching myself, but so also are the Ahmedabad doctors.
('41', 201, 3, 12, 395800) It is open to them to veto the experiment at any time they like and I have promised to stop it.
('41', 201, 3, 13, 395896) But I want you, instead of thinking of somehow dodging and making me to take milk, find out doctors or physicians who will help me to arrive at a proper, purely vegetarian diet which will be more than a substitute for milk.
('41', 201, 3, 14, 396120) I am sure it is perfectly possible.
('41', 201, 3, 15, 396156) Do please therefore think over my suggestion.
('41', 201, 3, 16, 396202) Have you heard from Singapore friends at all?
('41', 201, 3, 17, 396248) If we are to go, I should like to start during the first week of April, because the hot weather commences in right earnest in April in Ahmedabad and it would be better to avoid it.
('41', 201, 3, 18, 396429) And then there is the talk of a visit to Burma from Singapore.
('41', 201, 3, 19, 396492) I should like to negotiate it and, if that also is to be done, there is very little time left.
('41', 201, 3, 20, 396587) And then there are two invitations from Europe to go there during July and August.
('41', 201, 3, 21, 396670) 1 I am inclined to accept them.
('41', 201, 3, 22, 396702) The idea is cooking in my brain.
('41', 201, 3, 23, 396735) One is from the Worlds Youth Peace Movement.
('41', 201, 3, 24, 396780) It seems to be an important movement managed by a good organization.
('41', 201, 3, 25, 396849) You may also consider the propriety or otherwise of accepting these invitations.

('41', 202, 8, 12, 397617) MY DEAR CHILD, I had your two letters under one cover.
('41', 202, 8, 13, 397672) It did appear to me that you had forgotten me entirely, and yet I knew that that wasnt possible.

('41', 202, 8, 15, 397860) You must have heard about the relapse in my health.
('41', 202, 8, 16, 397912) I am now under strict orders not to do any serious work involving mental or physical strain.
('41', 202, 8, 17, 398005) Except for spinning, therefore, I am on my back.
('41', 202, 8, 18, 398054) I am dictating this whilst spinning.
('41', 202, 8, 19, 398091) But there is no cause for anxiety.
('41', 202, 8, 20, 398126) I am getting better and hope soon to be allowed to move about.
('41', 202, 8, 21, 398189) The Ashram remains what you have seen it to be.

('41', 203, 5, 15, 399032) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 18, 1928
('41', 203, 6, 16, 399073) MY DEAR VIOLET, I have your letter.
('41', 203, 6, 17, 399109) I am very glad you have written to me so rankly and fully.
('41', 203, 6, 18, 399168) Bad though this proposed wedding of the ex Maharajah of Indore is, I would like you to understand the distincion between that wedding and the Simon Commission.
('41', 203, 6, 19, 399328) The Simon Commission is a public thing, whereas the wedding is a private affair.
('41', 203, 6, 20, 399409) A wedding cannot affect the future of three hundred millions of India but the doings of the Simon Commission are calculated for better or for worse to affect the future of the whole of India.
('41', 203, 6, 21, 399601) You can now understand the public resentment over the Simon Commission.
('41', 203, 6, 22, 399673) Nobody thinks anything of the misdeeds of private Englishmen or other white men.
('41', 203, 6, 23, 399754) But when an Englishman does anything wrong in his official capacity, it is immediately resented and quite properly too.
('41', 203, 6, 24, 399874) If you have not yet understood or do not appreciate the distinction I have made, please write to me.

('41', 204, 1, 3, 400164) I have no doubt that the generous people of Ceylon are quite capable of taking up more than a lakh rupees worth of khadi because there is nothing strange about [it], but what will induce me to come back to Ceylon is another donation to khadi.
('41', 204, 1, 4, 400407) Buying of khadi is merely exchanging, valuable as that is, and donation to khadi enables me to widen the sphere of work among the poorest classes.

('41', 204, 5, 9, 400714) Readers know that this memorial is with regard to the Nationalist Muslim University in Delhi.
('41', 204, 5, 10, 400808) This Vidyapith is not meant exclusively for Muslims.
('41', 204, 5, 11, 400861) Hindus may also join it.
('41', 204, 5, 12, 400886) The teachers too are not exclusively Muslim; Hindus and Christians also are there.
('41', 204, 5, 13, 400969) However, as in the case of the Gujarat Vidyapith, where the students are mostly Hindus, since Muslim students rarely join it, so at the Jamia Millia too, few Hindus are enrolled.
('41', 204, 5, 14, 401148) If the authorities of the Gujarat Vidyapith could be blamed for the reluctance of Muslim students the authorities of the Muslim university can also be blamed for the reluctance of Hindu students to join them.
('41', 204, 5, 15, 401357) Considering the present vitiated atmosphere we should be content and grateful to God if the management and the staff of both the institutions are free from rancour and mutually accomodating.
('41', 204, 5, 16, 401548) It is my belief that just as the Gujarat Vidyapith will contribute substantially towards the attainment of swaraj and will help to safeguard it, that is, in implementing such constructive programmes as Hindu Muslim unity, etc., so too will this Vidyapith at Delhi.
('41', 204, 5, 17, 401813) This prophecy of mine may or may not come true but if we owe anything to Hakim Saheb, and if it brings us credit to have a memorial to him for ever with us, we should all, to the best of our abilities, contribute to his Fund.
('41', 204, 5, 18, 402039) The Fund is growing at less thana snails pace, from which I gather that the Gujaratis do not respond to this cause as they do to other causes.
('41', 204, 5, 19, 402182) I regard it my duty to say that
('41', 205, 0, 1, 402214) 206 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 205, 1, 2, 402256) this is not the correct attitude.
('41', 205, 1, 3, 402290) Those who wish to achieve Hindu Muslim unity should help this cause.
('41', 205, 1, 4, 402359) Everyone is inclined to contribute to a popular cause.
('41', 205, 1, 5, 402414) People remain indifferent to a fund which is not popular, though it be beneficial in the long run, if there is no one to rouse them.
('41', 205, 1, 6, 402547) This is my appeal to that indifferent class.
('41', 205, 1, 7, 402592) It is not that the readers of Navajivan always encourage only what is popular.
('41', 205, 1, 8, 402671) The readers of Navajivan have contributed in other ways, if not in the form of money, to funds that were not popular but would increase peoples strength.
('41', 205, 1, 9, 402825) They must now show that liberal spirit and power of discretion.
('41', 205, 1, 10, 402889) Let not the Jamia Millia be crushed between the two opposing forces.
('41', 205, 1, 11, 402958) Since the Jamia Millia does not nourish the present atmosphere of hatred, the general Muslim masses appear indifferent towards it, and if the Hindus too should be indifferent under the presumption that Muslims alone should support it, the Jamia Millia would be nowhere and Hakimjis memorial would meet with the same fate.
('41', 205, 1, 12, 403280) It is the special duty of Swarajists, Hindus as well as Muslims, not to let this happen.
('41', 205, 1, 13, 403369) I hope the readers of Navajivan will observe this dharma.
('41', 205, 1, 14, 403427) I suggest donors should not rest content after giving in their personal contributions but should also try to collect as much as possible from their neighbours.

('41', 205, 2, 16, 403624) 226. TO THE PEASANTS OF BARDOLI
('41', 205, 3, 17, 403656) There is not a corner of India familiar with the word swaraj which is not also familiar with Bardoli.
('41', 205, 3, 18, 403758) The country has, therefore, a right to expect something distinctive and courageous in all the tasks that are undertaken by this taluk.
('41', 205, 3, 19, 403893) You have taken the very grave step of offering satyagraha.
('41', 205, 3, 20, 403952) You have now no alternative but to prove yourselves worthy of it.
('41', 205, 3, 21, 404018) No one could have found fault with you if you had not taken that step.
('41', 205, 3, 22, 404089) However, having once taken it, you will make yourselves an object of ridicule in the eyes of the whole of India if you beat a retreat now.
('41', 205, 3, 23, 404228) No one can blame Bardoli for the postponement of the fight for swaraj that it had pioneered.
('41', 205, 3, 24, 404321) People in a far off province committed an act of indiscretion and the Bardoli movement had to be postponed.
('41', 205, 3, 25, 404429) I have not the slightest doubt that it was all to the good.
('41', 205, 3, 26, 404489) However, on this occasion, I think it is proper to remind you that thereafter you have not been keeping to the extent you should your vows about khadi, untouchability and so on.
('41', 206, 0, 1, 404667) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 207
('41', 206, 1, 2, 404709) because of this laxity on your part, I have my doubts about how far you will adhere to the pledge you have taken this time.
('41', 206, 1, 3, 404833) I hope you will dispel this fear by your determined conduct.
('41', 206, 1, 4, 404894) Shri Vallabhbhai Patel had given you a clear warning.
('41', 206, 1, 5, 404948) It is not in his hands to make a success of your struggle.
('41', 206, 1, 6, 405007) The key to success is in your own hands.
('41', 206, 1, 7, 405048) Even if he goes to the gallows, Vallabhbhai cannot fulfil your pledge.
('41', 206, 1, 8, 405119) As the saying goes: One cannot go to heaven unless one dies. So also one has to fulfil ones own pledges.
('41', 206, 1, 9, 405224) I do not think there are two opinions about the justice of your cause.
('41', 206, 1, 10, 405295) If, however, you do not have the strength to prove it you will not triumph despite its justice.
('41', 206, 1, 11, 405391) If you understand it, rather than till the land only to pay the vighoti 1 it would be saving yourselves a great deal of trouble if those who collect this tax confiscated your land.
('41', 206, 1, 12, 405572) If the Government will not listen to you and you do not bow down to themand if the Government aims at ruining you, it will not send you to jails, but will rather seize your property.
('41', 206, 1, 13, 405755) As in Kheda, here too they would confiscate your utensils and your land.
('41', 206, 1, 14, 405828) Nevertheless, you have one invaluable thing which they cannot attach and that is your soul, your self respect.
('41', 206, 1, 15, 405939) If you put your person and all your property in one scale and your self respect in the other, the latter will always be found heavier.
('41', 206, 1, 16, 406074) Satyagraha is the mantra for safeguarding it.
('41', 206, 1, 17, 406120) Victory is is yours if you are prepared to withstand whatever loss you may incur while safeguarding it and you will prove worthy of having a leader like Vallabhbhai; moreover, you yourselves will be included in the catergory of the courageous.
('41', 206, 1, 18, 406364) You must see to it that by fulfilling your pledge you enhance your own prestige as well as that of Vallabhbhai, Gujarat and the whole of India.

('41', 208, 3, 4, 408183) MISS ROHINI POOVIAH, Your letter was an unexpected pleasure.
('41', 208, 3, 5, 408244) As I am under orders not to work and have still to lie on my back as much as possible, I must not dictate much beyond telling you that I have often thought of you and wanted to know what you were doing.
('41', 208, 3, 6, 408447) I do hope that you will get something suitable in the near future.
('41', 208, 3, 7, 408514) Do please keep me informed of your movements and I shall forgive all your past crimes.

('41', 210, 6, 11, 410861) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter 1. Under British rule, millions of children are starving for want of nourishing food and they are shivering in winter for want of sufficient clothing.
('41', 210, 6, 12, 411044) And this I say not of the cities of India, which contain but a microscopic minority of the population of India, but I say this without fear of contradiction about the seven hundred thousand villages of the country scattered over a surface 1,900 miles long and 1,500 miles broad.
('41', 210, 6, 13, 411323) I suppose your first question under non Christian Religions is included in the second.
('41', 210, 6, 14, 411410) But, if your first question relates to India before British rule, I can only give you my inference that the little ones were infinitely happier than they are now under British rule.
('41', 210, 6, 15, 411592) Your third question is difficult to answer.
('41', 210, 6, 16, 411636) Which Jesus have you in mind?
('41', 210, 6, 17, 411666) The Jesus of history?
('41', 210, 6, 18, 411688) Not being a critical student of history, I do not know the Jesus of history.
('41', 210, 6, 19, 411765) Do you mean the Jesus whom Christian England and Christian Europe represent?
('41', 210, 6, 20, 411842) If so, your question is, it seems to me, already answered.

('41', 212, 1, 4, 413725) In doing so, I came upon your letter.
('41', 212, 1, 5, 413763) I am glad about the compromise 1. I hope that now there will be no more violent scenes.
('41', 212, 1, 6, 413851) What you say about the Congress is largely true.
('41', 212, 1, 7, 413900) 2 And those who believe in constructive work and non violence have to counter act the talkative activities and falsities by silent, dignified, unrevengeful work and that alone.
('41', 212, 1, 8, 414077) I do not make of the Congress a fetish, but the oldest political institution we have in the country has to be approached with becoming respect and tenderest feeling.
('41', 212, 1, 9, 414243) All public institutions have their ups and downs.
('41', 212, 1, 10, 414293) Has not the House of Commons got its hypocrisy and humbug?
('41', 212, 1, 11, 414352) I know that it is no model for us, but for the British nation, modelled as it is, it would be wrong to decry the House of Commons.
('41', 212, 1, 12, 414483) They can only mend it wherever it is possible, unless there are Englishmen who consider the civilization that the House of Commons represents is worthless.
('41', 212, 1, 13, 414639) Personally, I still cling to the ideal that the Congress represents, and, therefore, generally observe silence where I cannot serve and I ask you and co workers who are non violent non co operators to do likewise.
('41', 212, 1, 14, 414853) We have to be non violent even towards erring co workers, erring Congressmen.

('41', 213, 3, 4, 415596) I had asked Mahadev to ask you to fix the last date for receiving the essay on cow protection.
('41', 213, 3, 5, 415691) If it has not been fixed, please fix it and announce it.
('41', 213, 3, 6, 415748) Give again the same names of the examiners and the rules, etc., which were published earlier.
('41', 213, 3, 7, 415842) 2 Settle both about the Gujarati and the English.
('41', 213, 3, 8, 415892) Appoint a graduate of 15 years experience and ask him to join for a fixed date.

('41', 213, 3, 10, 416059) If it were in my hands to fix the happy day on which my death would be celebrated, I would announce it right now.
('41', 213, 3, 11, 416173) I would feel no sinking of the heart in doing so, but, on the contrary, would say, Behold this trikaldarshi 4! Who can have such good fortune, though?
('41', 213, 3, 12, 416324) Yes, the mind certainly keeps on asking if I am eager to live on even after March 18, 1928. And the reply it gets is that even today I have no such eagerness.
('41', 213, 3, 13, 416483) If living without attachment be considered weakness, let it be so considered.
('41', 213, 3, 14, 416561) For my part, as long as I live I will at least go on spinning, if I cannot sew.

('41', 214, 1, 2, 417629) 239. REMINDING OF OLD TIMES Sjt.
('41', 214, 1, 3, 417662) Shankarrao Dev and Sjt.
('41', 214, 1, 4, 417686) V. B. Harolikar were convicted the other day at Poona under Section 124 A and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for two years with hard labour.
('41', 214, 1, 5, 417830) There were two charges against them: waging war against the King (Section 121) and attempting to excite disaffection against the Government established by law in British India (Section 124 A).
('41', 214, 1, 6, 418023) Dev as editor of Swarajya wrote the article which was the subject matter of the offence and Sjt.
('41', 214, 1, 7, 418120) Harolikar was the publisher.
('41', 214, 1, 8, 418149) I print elsewhere the authorized translation of the offending article as produced before the court by the prosecution.
('41', 214, 1, 9, 418268) Though it admits of improvement, it cannot be called an unfair presentation of the original.
('41', 214, 1, 10, 418361) The accused will not be defended by counsel though free assistance was volunteered by Dadasaheb Karandikar and other lawyers of distinction.
('41', 214, 1, 11, 418502) Friends advised them to be defended.
('41', 214, 1, 12, 418539) They were told that everybody nowadays sought legal advice without any slur being cast on them.
('41', 214, 1, 13, 418635) But these non co operators were adamant.
('41', 214, 1, 14, 418676) They did not care what others did.
('41', 214, 1, 15, 418711) They were non co operators on principle and therefore did not wish to listen to any advice based on prudential considerations.
('41', 214, 1, 16, 418838) I knew Sjt.
('41', 214, 1, 17, 418850) Dev in Yeravda.
('41', 214, 1, 18, 418866) He with Sjt.
('41', 214, 1, 19, 418879) Dastane had undertaken a severe fast from which it was difficult for me to wean them.
('41', 214, 1, 20, 418965) I tender my congratulations to these friends on their firmness in abiding by their own convictions.
('41', 214, 1, 21, 419065) For I am convinced that of such will the Kingdom of Swaraj be made.
('41', 214, 1, 22, 419133) They have undoubtedly brought swaraj nearer by their crystal like sacrifice.
('41', 214, 1, 23, 419210) Let no one think that such solitary individual sacrifice has no place in national upbuilding, or that it does not produce great consequences.
('41', 214, 1, 24, 419352) Indeed, it is the purest sacrifice alone that will count in the end.
('41', 214, 1, 25, 419421) It lays the surest and the purest foundation of swaraj.
('41', 214, 1, 26, 419477) The article is undoubtedly written to promote disaffection against the existing Government.
('41', 214, 1, 27, 419569) To promote such disaffection is the bounden duty of every nationalist.
('41', 214, 1, 28, 419640) Every Congressman is, I hope, an avowed enemy of the existing Government.
('41', 214, 1, 29, 419714) We have no quarrel with men, but if we are worthy of swaraj, we must destroy the existing system of Government by all legitimate and peaceful means.
('41', 214, 1, 30, 419863) The recent debate in the Assembly on the Statutory Com mission was an object lesson in disaffection in which all parties, be it said to their eternal credit, whole heartedly joined.
('41', 214, 1, 31, 420045) The late Harchandrai Vishandas
('41', 215, 0, 1, 420076) 216 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 215, 1, 2, 420118) risked his life in travelling to Delhi for the sake of registering his vote in favour of disaffection.
('41', 215, 1, 3, 420221) One daily comes across stronger articles than Devs in point of disaffection.
('41', 215, 1, 4, 420298) His is a reasoned appeal to Hindus and Mussalmans to disown the protection of a Government that enslaves the country and if fight they must, fight fairly, squarely, honourably.
('41', 215, 1, 5, 420475) I have read the article more than once and whilst I may not use the same language, there is nothing in the argument that I cannot adopt.
('41', 215, 1, 6, 420612) A prejudiced critic may cavil at the verse quoted from the Mahabharata.
('41', 215, 1, 7, 420684) But, read together with the context, its meaning is clear.
('41', 215, 1, 8, 420743) We have no King.
('41', 215, 1, 9, 420760) We have a rule masquerading under the sacred name of law.
('41', 215, 1, 10, 420818) Rulers are many.
('41', 215, 1, 11, 420835) They come and go.
('41', 215, 1, 12, 420853) The rule abides.
('41', 215, 1, 13, 420870) But it is a corrupt, mischievous, soul destroying rule which has to be ended at any cost.
('41', 215, 1, 14, 420960) The cost that Dev and people like him are prepared to pay has to be consistent with their creed of non violence.
('41', 215, 1, 15, 421073) They seek to establish the rule of real law not by killing other people, however misguided or cruel they may be, but by being themselves killed, if need be, in the attempt.
('41', 215, 1, 16, 421246) This is the necessary limitation imposed upon them by their very conception of swaraj.
('41', 215, 1, 17, 421333) It is, therefore, most difficult for me to understand why these two innocent workers were singled out for prosecution, or shall I call it, persecution.
('41', 215, 1, 18, 421485) If they are fit for imprisonment, Lala Lajpat Rai and company are surely fit for transportation, if nothing worse.
('41', 215, 1, 19, 421600) If it be said that the Assembly gives members privileges for statutory crimes which ordinary mortals outside do not enjoy, there is then, perhaps, no one who is guilty of such calculated and deliberate disaffection towards the Government established by law as I am.
('41', 215, 1, 20, 421866) The whole of my being is worked in order to achieve the destruction of this Government and to that end to spread disaffection as wide as possible, and I think I can lay a fair claim to having a somewhat larger audience than Dev and Harolikar.
('41', 215, 1, 21, 422109) But real consistency, justice and courage are hardly to be expected of governments that are based upon exploitation sustained by violence.

('41', 216, 1, 3, 422330) SPINNING WHEEL
('41', 216, 2, 4, 422345) Apropos of the contention often thoughtlessly advanced than the handloom is the only thing worth preserving and that it can only be preserved through the use of mill spun yarn, Sjt.
('41', 216, 2, 5, 422527) C. Balaji Rao writes:
('41', 216, 3, 6, 422549) An effective answer to those who, in order to belittle the charkha, would exalt the handloom, is given here.
('41', 216, 3, 7, 422658) Lord Curzon was voicing the opinions of his departmental scientific advisers when he declared at the Delhi Durbar that it was inevitable that the handloom should be superseded by the powerloom, just as the hand punkah was being superseded by the electric fan.
('41', 216, 3, 8, 422918) Of course, Lord Curzons dictum need not be accepted as a conclusive answer if the longevity of the handloom can be sustained through mill yarn or any other means save the spinning wheel.
('41', 216, 3, 9, 423105) And these pages, I hope, are daily making it clear that hand spinning can save the handloom in spite of the prediction of Lord Curzon.
('41', 216, 3, 10, 423240) Indeed, if the wheel regains its ancient status in our national life, the handloom and many other domestic industries must revive automatically.

('41', 216, 4, 12, 423408) 241. THE ORIGIN OF IT
('41', 216, 5, 13, 423430) I observe that newspaper paragraphs have been going round that I have predicted my own death by the 12th of March next and that, as a consquence, I am in a despondent mood.
('41', 216, 5, 14, 423603) It is also stated that I am my own astrologer.
('41', 216, 5, 15, 423650) I would have passed over this delicious morsel of news but for the fact that many anxious friends have taken it seriously and have, therefore, been upset.
('41', 216, 5, 16, 423805) If the enquiring friends had only followed my advice never to depend upon newspaper paragraphs, but always to ascertain, at their source, the truth of statements seen in the Press, they would have been spared all that anxiety.
('41', 216, 5, 17, 424032) The correspon dent who set the news in motion could also have spared the enquirers considerable anxiety if he had been good enough to test the truth of statements made by him.
('41', 216, 5, 18, 424208) But if the correspondents became more scrupulous about statements they may make, their occupation would be largely gone.
('41', 216, 5, 19, 424329) I may then state for the information of friends that I am not an astrologer, I know nothing of the science of astrology and that I consider it to be a science, if it is a science, of doubtful value, to be severely left alone by those who have any faith in Providence.
('41', 217, 0, 1, 424597) 218 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 217, 1, 2, 424639) am I in a despondent mood, despondency being foreign to my nature.
('41', 217, 1, 3, 424706) What precisely, however, did happen was this.
('41', 217, 1, 4, 424752) When I was convicted six years ago and was asked what I thought about the prospects of swaraj, I said that it was highly likely that there was the hand of God in the limit of six years and that during that time either we should win swaraj or that I should die and that six years time was long enough time for the country to win her freedom.
('41', 217, 1, 5, 425093) This statement was based upon an observation of the state of things as then prevailed in India.
('41', 217, 1, 6, 425189) I never attached any importance to it beyond this that I should myself leave no stone unturned to contribute so far as an individual could to the attainment of our freedom.
('41', 217, 1, 7, 425362) The statement was on a par with the conditional statement made by me in 1920 about attainment of swaraj within one year.
('41', 217, 1, 8, 425483) 1 That statement has served the purpose, if of nothing else, of giving satisfaction to my critics of laughing at my folly and to me that of seeing a tremendous effort being made by the country during that eventful year.
('41', 217, 1, 9, 425703) I did not hesitate to say at the end of the year, when the Congress was held in Ahmedabad, that whilst we had not been able to achieve statutory swaraj, the freedom that politically minded India gave itself and the unity that seemed to exist among the various communities amounted to substantial swaraj, and that if the people had carried out the conditions mentioned by me at Calcutta and Nagpur, they could have even attained statutory swaraj within the year.
('41', 217, 1, 10, 426165) But even as I remained unaffected, in spite of the failure to attain statutory swaraj within the year specified, so do I remain unaffected in spite of the approaching termination of six years which, by the by, is not the 12th of March but the 17th of March next 2 .
('41', 217, 1, 11, 426431) Not only am I not preparing for the imminent approach of the dissolution of my body, but I am making every effort to put it in as good order and condition as is possible, and have already fixed some provisional appointments for the coming summer and the rainy season.
('41', 217, 1, 12, 426699) After all the relevant portion of my talk six years ago, twice repeated to friends, was the attainment of Indias freedom.
('41', 217, 1, 13, 426821) Nothing depends upon the death of an individual, be he ever so great, but much depends upon the freedom of India.
('41', 217, 1, 14, 426935) Let us, therefore, all forget individuals and concentrate upon attaining that precious freedom which will never be

('41', 218, 1, 3, 427436) No great preparation save a mental revolution is necessary for us Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Sikhs, Christians and Jews and othersto feel as one indivisible nation and as having a common stake in the country, nor is more than a mental revolution required for Hindus to forget that anyone is to be considered superior to any other and to regard the so called untouchables to be their own kith and kin, nor is much effort required if we but make the resolve to achieve complete boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 218, 1, 4, 427939) I repeat what I have said so often, at the risk of exciting laughter, that if we achieve this triple programme, no power on earth can prevent us from attaining our birthright.
('41', 218, 1, 5, 428115) It is for us to work out our own salvation as it is in us to compass our own undoing.

('41', 218, 4, 9, 428288) MY DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('41', 218, 4, 10, 428324) The newspapers wholly exaggerate the real thing.
('41', 218, 4, 11, 428373) So far as I am aware, there is nothing wrong with me.
('41', 218, 4, 12, 428427) Of course, I am weak because of my non milk fruitarian experiment.
('41', 218, 4, 13, 428494) But I am under strict medical observation and making the experiment under their watch and with their permission.
('41', 218, 4, 14, 428607) There is therefore not the slightest cause for anxiety.
('41', 218, 4, 15, 428663) I am sorry about your eyes.
('41', 218, 4, 16, 428691) You must not work them beyond their capacity.
('41', 218, 4, 17, 428737) Mahadev just now lives between Bardoli and Sabarmati.
('41', 218, 4, 18, 428791) He is helping Vallabhbhai.
('41', 218, 4, 19, 428818) He went to Bardoli last night and wont return before Monday morning.
('41', 218, 4, 20, 428887) You will see something from me in the current issue of Young India with reference to the 12th of March also.
('41', 218, 4, 21, 428996) 1 Really newspaper reports do more harm than good.
('41', 218, 4, 22, 429047) But I must not give you a long letter.
('41', 218, 4, 23, 429086) Doctors want me to take complete rest and I am carrying out their instructions almost to the letter.

('41', 220, 3, 4, 430364) MY DEAR FRIEND, I have your very delightful letter which I deeply appreciate.
('41', 220, 3, 5, 430442) I must not however accept your advice.
('41', 220, 3, 6, 430481) Resist not evil with me has never meant passive resistance.
('41', 220, 3, 7, 430541) The word passive resistance I have described as a misnomer for the resistance which I have known and offered.
('41', 220, 3, 8, 430651) The paraphrase of resist not evil means resist not evil with evil, and therefore necessarily means resist evil with good.
('41', 220, 3, 9, 430773) And, if at the present moment, I do not seem to be actively resisting evil, it is a mere appearance.
('41', 220, 3, 10, 430874) For, if you are a constant reader of Bhagavad Gita, you will recall the passage, He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action sees truly. 1 Or is there not the corresponding English saying He also serves who waits and prays or something like that?
('41', 220, 3, 11, 431131) Anyway such is absolutely my position today.
('41', 220, 3, 12, 431176) If I could see my way clear leading to boycott movement, do not imagine for one moment that I would sit still for a single moment.
('41', 220, 3, 13, 431307) But the way is not clear.
('41', 220, 3, 14, 431333) It may clear any day.
('41', 220, 3, 15, 431355) I want a living faith on the part of known workers in the boycott as I have prescribed from time to time in the pages of Young India.
('41', 220, 3, 16, 431489) I am positive that no other boycott can possibly succeed, as I am equally positive that this boycott must succeed if there is enough work behind it.
('41', 220, 3, 17, 431638) Huge demonstrations that have been taking place in Calcutta are good in their way, but not good enough for me.
('41', 220, 3, 18, 431749) There is no reality behind them.
('41', 220, 3, 19, 431782) They have their use too, but they cannot enthuse me as an active soldier.
('41', 220, 3, 20, 431856) I hope I am clear.
('41', 220, 3, 21, 431875) If not, do please tackle me again.
('41', 220, 3, 22, 431910) I am anxious for you to understand me and my movement through and through.

('41', 221, 3, 4, 432206) CHHAGANLAL, I received your first letter today and the second letter three days earlier.
('41', 221, 3, 5, 432295) I have given them to Mahadev for everyone to read.
('41', 221, 3, 6, 432346) You have done a good job if you have seen in a short period all those institutions as closely as possible.
('41', 221, 3, 7, 432453) Look after your health and for doing so, you have to use a mosquito net.
('41', 221, 3, 8, 432526) Do not have the least hesitation in using it there.
('41', 221, 3, 9, 432578) You might come across people who would criticise it the first day, the next day the same people would praise you for your well maintained health, and on the third, they would follow your example.
('41', 221, 3, 10, 432774) Mosquito net is just an example.
('41', 221, 3, 11, 432807) Do not hesitate to write to me.
('41', 221, 3, 12, 432839) I have always liked your letters.
('41', 221, 3, 13, 432873) Reading your handwriting is never a problem.
('41', 221, 3, 14, 432918) I knew that you were hesitant to go to Orissa because of my health, but it is your dharma to overcome that hesitation and to help you in that is my dharma.
('41', 221, 3, 15, 433074) I believe that my health is very good.
('41', 221, 3, 16, 433113) The experiment with milkless diet seems to be successful so far.
('41', 221, 3, 17, 433178) I take 8 tolas of wheat, 3/4 tola olive oil, 4 tolas almonds, one seer tandarjo 1and 6 to 9 oranges.
('41', 221, 3, 18, 433279) I still need to increase my diet.
('41', 221, 3, 19, 433313) If I can do that gradually, I hope to regain part or entire weight I have lost.
('41', 221, 3, 20, 433393) Ramdas and Nimu have gone to Rajkot.
('41', 221, 3, 21, 433430) From there, they will go to Amreli and will be back here in 15 days.
('41', 221, 3, 22, 433499) 2 Jamnadas is tempting Ramdas, so he may stay on there.
('41', 221, 3, 23, 433555) He may even stay there if he has to live permanently in Amreli.
('41', 221, 3, 24, 433619) He will make a final decision on coming here.
('41', 221, 3, 25, 433665) These days he is cheerful and free from worries.
('41', 221, 3, 26, 433714) Brian Gabriel is here for the last two days.

('41', 222, 3, 5, 434195) I did indeed know that Congress Committees were practically sleeping.
('41', 222, 3, 6, 434265) It would be a great thing if you can put life into them without giving rise to any suspicion about your notice.
('41', 222, 3, 7, 434377) What is this British goods boycott demonstration?
('41', 222, 3, 8, 434427) And what are these ten thousand volunteers?

('41', 222, 3, 12, 434639) I am glad you are giving Kuhnes baths to Nikhil.
('41', 222, 3, 13, 434688) Why not consult Bose.
('41', 222, 3, 14, 434710) He is a water cure specialist.
('41', 222, 3, 15, 434741) You know he had an institution in Bow Bazaar where I used to go for my treatment.
('41', 222, 3, 16, 434823) At that time Bose was away, but Mazmudar used to give me massage and electric bath.
('41', 222, 3, 17, 434907) Often the simple remedy succeeds where specialists fail.
('41', 222, 3, 18, 434964) The meaning you have given to the word sankara is original, but thoroughly in keeping with my definition of varna, and, after all, my definition is the literal definition of the Veda.
('41', 222, 3, 19, 435148) The third chapter is undoubtedly the key chapter of the Gita.
('41', 222, 3, 20, 435210) The first two are introductory and the last fifteen a commentary.
('41', 222, 3, 21, 435276) I think I told you that for some time now in the Ashram we have been reciting the Gita every day, the whole of it being finished every fortnight, Chapters VII and VIII, XII and XIII, XIV and XV, and XVI and XVII being recited each pair one day.

('41', 224, 8, 11, 436932) RESPECTED REVASHANKERBHAI, I have Dr. Muthus wire today; I sent you one 2 on receiving it, and you must have got it.
('41', 224, 8, 12, 437049) If Dhiru has arrived by now, I think it advisable that you should wire to Dr. Muthu that he should come.
('41', 224, 8, 13, 437154) He is right in saying that he cannot come to any conclusion without an examination.
('41', 224, 8, 14, 437238) I do not know what his fee is, but whatever it is, it is necessary that you should cheerfully pay it.
('41', 224, 8, 15, 437340) My health is better.
('41', 224, 8, 16, 437361) But the doctors still keep me in bed.
('41', 224, 8, 17, 437399) I hope you are well.

('41', 224, 11, 21, 437664) 1 The letter is among the S.N. paper for 1928. 2 This telegram is not available.

('41', 225, 1, 2, 437787) 251. WHO WILL RESCUE THIS HUMAN COW?
('41', 225, 1, 3, 437824) A gentleman, nearly 70 years old, belonging to the Brahmabhatt caste was married four times.
('41', 225, 1, 4, 437917) All four wives are dead.
('41', 225, 1, 5, 437942) He has no son, only a daughter who is fifteen.
('41', 225, 1, 6, 437989) She has already been married.
('41', 225, 1, 7, 438019) He now wishes to marry for the fifth time in order to have someone to run his household and fulfil his desire for a son.
('41', 225, 1, 8, 438140) This gentleman has been abroad.
('41', 225, 1, 9, 438172) He held a decent post in the Gaekwars State.
('41', 225, 1, 10, 438217) He has lost his eyesight owing to cataract.
('41', 225, 1, 11, 438261) This, much married old man is waiting for some cruel father who is prepared to sell his daughter.
('41', 225, 1, 12, 438359) Some young men of the Brahmabhatt community are trying to save the meek cow from being sent in this way to the slaughter house.
('41', 225, 1, 13, 438487) One of them wrote a letter to the old man in order to persuade him not to commit such an act.
('41', 225, 1, 14, 438581) The gentleman has replied to it at length.
('41', 225, 1, 15, 438624) A copy of this has been sent to me.
('41', 225, 1, 16, 438660) I give below extracts 1 from it : I publish this letter at the risk of being considered foolish.
('41', 225, 1, 17, 438757) If there is an absence of feeling for young girls in the Brahmabhatt community, if sensitive people in the community lack courage and if there is no such thing as public opinion in it, no one will be able to prevent this ill mat ched union.
('41', 225, 1, 18, 438998) However, the handful of kind hearted young men or women belonging to that community must not neglect their duty.
('41', 225, 1, 19, 439111) Reform, if it is to be carried out in a peaceful manner, can be carried out only through love and patience.
('41', 225, 1, 20, 439219) We must put up with anger in any form if it is the re sult of self interest.
('41', 225, 1, 21, 439296) We should not be dazzled by anyone trying to impress by his knowledge.
('41', 225, 1, 22, 439367) Within the last one year, two such marriages could be prevented through diligence and by arousing public opinion.
('41', 225, 1, 23, 439481) An engagement that had already taken place was broken off whereas in this instance there has only been talk of an engagement.
('41', 225, 1, 24, 439607) If public opinion can be created the meek cow is likely to be rescued from being slaughtered.
('41', 225, 1, 25, 439701) Let us now examine the letter from this gentleman, who had been to England.
('41', 225, 1, 26, 439777) I am unable to understand what he intends to prove by giv ing instances of men becoming fathers at an advanced age.
('41', 225, 1, 27, 439893) His arguments are the same old ones that have always been advanced by sinners.
('41', 225, 1, 28, 439972) In novels, we have come across murderers describing the benefits of murder in beautiful language.
('41', 225, 1, 29, 440070) And we have also come across robbers singing praises of their deeds.
('41', 225, 1, 30, 440139) These acts may well have benefited those who committed them; but they have not benefited the world.
('41', 225, 1, 31, 440239) Let us take the practice of ill matched unions.
('41', 225, 1, 32, 440287) In the instances
('41', 225, 2, 33, 440304) 1 Not translated here
('41', 226, 0, 1, 440326) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 227
('41', 226, 1, 2, 440368) which have been cited in the above extract, the men concerned may well have seen in it advantage to themselves.
('41', 226, 1, 3, 440480) However, these old men of experience who are motivated by self interest and a desire to gratify their lust are misinterpreting these instances in trying to get their own acts approved.
('41', 226, 1, 4, 440665) This gentleman does not have the time and does not feel the need to think what these young girls must have thought when marrying these old men, how often they must have sighed.
('41', 226, 1, 5, 440842) If one old man has the right to marry a girl of thirteen or fifteen, all old men should have this right and, if all of them were to follow this practice, we can easily imagine what consequences it would have on the people.
('41', 226, 1, 6, 441065) Nowhere in the world have wise men been known to commend ill matched unions.
('41', 226, 1, 7, 441142) They have been condemned in all countries and in India we actually see the many evil consequences that follow from them.
('41', 226, 1, 8, 441263) Hence, I hope this gentleman would review his own letter, written in an angry and impulsive mood, in a new light and gain control over his lust.
('41', 226, 1, 9, 441408) And, if the cannot do it, he should look for a widow who is prepared to marry him of her own free will.
('41', 226, 1, 10, 441512) The craving for a male offspring needs to be given up.
('41', 226, 1, 11, 441567) It cannot be said that this desire is always noble.
('41', 226, 1, 12, 441619) Amongst a people where the birth and death ratio is regularly balanced it is noble to restrain rather than indulge the desire for a son.
('41', 226, 1, 13, 441756) In India today because we are slaves, everyone is in a state of fear, and because we have lost the capacity to protect ourselves, our relatives as well as our property, I regard it as a sin to beget children.
('41', 226, 1, 14, 441965) Now about the desire to be nursed.
('41', 226, 1, 15, 442000) What a misconceived idea that only ones own people can render this help.
('41', 226, 1, 16, 442073) I regard it as the limit of audacity to grab an innocent girl by bribing or luring her father and then regarding her as ones own.
('41', 226, 1, 17, 442203) Instead of calling that girl ones own, it would be nearer the truth to say that a slave girl has been bought.
('41', 226, 1, 18, 442313) As for service one can still get good loyal servants if one is prepared to pay well.
('41', 226, 1, 19, 442398) I wish to leave aside now the other atrocious ideas in the letter.
('41', 226, 1, 20, 442465) If he happens to read this article, I humbly request him to calmly reflect on it and save himself from the misadventure on which he is about to embark.

('41', 227, 1, 2, 442696) 252. STUDENTS NOBLE SATYAGRAHA 1
('41', 227, 2, 3, 442729) In referring to the universality of satyagraha I have time and again observed in these columns that it is capable of application in the social no less than in the political field.
('41', 227, 2, 4, 442909) It may equally be employed against Government, society, or ones own family, father, mother, husband or wife, as the case may be.
('41', 227, 2, 5, 443038) For it is the beauty of this spiritual weapon that, when it is completely free from the taint of himsa and its use is actuated purely and solely by love it may be used with absolute impunity in any connection and in any circumstances whatever.
('41', 227, 2, 6, 443282) A concrete instance of its use against a social evil was furnished by the brave and spirited students of Dharmaj (in Kheda District) a few days back.
('41', 227, 2, 7, 443432) The facts as gleaned from the various communications about the incident received by me were as follows : A gentleman of Dharmaj, some days back, gave a caste dinner in connection with the twelfth day ceremony of the death of his mother.
('41', 227, 2, 8, 443669) It was preceded by a keen controversy about the subject among the young men of the place who shared with a number of other local inhabitants their strong dislike of this custom.
('41', 227, 2, 9, 443847) They felt that, on this occasion, something must be done.
('41', 227, 2, 10, 443905) Accordingly, most of them took all or some of the following three vows : 1. Not to join their elders at the dinner or otherwise partake of the food served on that occasion.
('41', 227, 2, 11, 444078) 2. To observe fast on the day of the dinner as an emphatic protest against this practice.
('41', 227, 2, 12, 444168) 3. To bear patiently and cheerfully any harsh treatment that might be accorded to them by their elders for taking this step.
('41', 227, 2, 13, 444293) In pursuance of this decision, quite a large number of students, including some children of tender age, fasted on the day on which the dinner was given and took upon themselves the wrath of their so called elders.
('41', 227, 2, 14, 444507) Nor was the step free from the dangers of serious pecuniary consequences to the students.
('41', 227, 2, 15, 444597) The elders threatened to stop the allowances of their boys and even to withdraw any financial aid that they were giving to local institutions, but the boys stood firm.
('41', 227, 2, 16, 444765) As many as two hundred and eighty five students thus refused to take part in the caste dinner and most of them fasted.
('41', 227, 3, 17, 444884) 1 The Gujarati original, of which this is a translation, was published in Navajivan.
('41', 227, 3, 18, 444969) 26 2 1928.
('41', 228, 0, 1, 444980) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 229
('41', 228, 1, 2, 445022) I tender my congratulations to these boys and hope that everywhere students will take a prominent part in effecting social reform.
('41', 228, 1, 3, 445153) They hold in their pocket, as it were, the key to social reform and the protection of their religion, just as they have in their possession the key to swarajthough they may not be aware of it owing to their negligence or carelessness.
('41', 228, 1, 4, 445388) But I hope that the example set by the students of Dharmaj will awaken them to a sense of their power.
('41', 228, 1, 5, 445491) In my opinion, the true shraddha of the deceased lady was performed by these young men fasting on that day, while those who gave the dinner wasted good money and set a bad example to the poor.
('41', 228, 1, 6, 445684) The rich, monied class ought to use their God given wealth for philanthropic purposes.
('41', 228, 1, 7, 445771) They should understand that the poor cannot afford to give caste dinners on wedding or on funeral ceremonies.
('41', 228, 1, 8, 445881) These bad practices have proved to be the ruin of many a poor man.
('41', 228, 1, 9, 445948) If the money that was spent in Dharmaj on the caste dinner had been used for helping poor students, or poor widows, or for khadi or cow protection or the amelioration of the untouchables, it would have borne fruit and brought peace to the departed soul.
('41', 228, 1, 10, 446202) But, as it is, the dinner has already been forgotten, it has profited nobody and it has caused pain to the students and the sensile section of the Dharmaj public.
('41', 228, 1, 11, 446365) Let no one imagine that the satyagraha has gone in vain because it did not succeed in preventing the dinner in question from taking place.
('41', 228, 1, 12, 446504) The students themselves knew that there was little possibility of their satyagraha producing any immediate tangible result.
('41', 228, 1, 13, 446628) But we may safely take it that, if they do not let their vigilance go to sleep, no shethia 1 will again dare to give a post mortem dinner.
('41', 228, 1, 14, 446767) A chronic and long standing social evil cannot be swept away at a stroke; it always requires patience and perseverance.
('41', 228, 1, 15, 446887) When will the elders of our society learn to recognize the signs of the times?
('41', 228, 1, 16, 446966) How long will they be slaves to custom instead of using it as a means for the amelioration of society and the country?
('41', 228, 1, 17, 447085) How long will they keep their children divorced from a practical application of the knowledge which they are helping them to acquire?
('41', 228, 1, 18, 447219) When will they rescue their sense of right and wrong from its present state of trance and wake up and be mahajans 2 in the true sense of the word?

('41', 229, 8, 12, 448104) Manilal and others too keep me informed of your movements.
('41', 229, 8, 13, 448163) Already urgent letters are being received to implore you not to leave South Africa at the end of your year.
('41', 229, 8, 14, 448271) They say you are already counting your months.
('41', 229, 8, 15, 448318) And they are trembling in their shoes, and more than them am I trembling, and perhaps, my tremble is weightier because of the absence of shoes.
('41', 229, 8, 16, 448462) For I really feel that except for grave reasons of health it would be a national tragedy for you to leave South Africa at the present moment.
('41', 229, 8, 17, 448604) And I am sorry to have to saybut it is truethat no one else can successfully replace you at the present moment.
('41', 229, 8, 18, 448716) The familiarity that your stay in South Africa might have produced has certainly not bred contempt; on the contrary, it has gained greater respect for you from those whose respect counts for the work.
('41', 229, 8, 19, 448917) And just as you have gained influence amongst the Europeans, you have gained staunch adherents amongst

('41', 230, 7, 12, 449469) MY DEAR JAWAHAR, I have your letters.
('41', 230, 7, 13, 449507) I am sensing all that is going on in Delhi and can understand every word of what you have said in your letter.
('41', 230, 7, 14, 449618) I cant give you an adequate conception of my grief as I follow the Conference proceedings from day to day and read between the lines.
('41', 230, 7, 15, 449752) Fathers illuminating letter only confirmed my own reading from a distance.
('41', 230, 7, 16, 449827) Then came Kripalanis letter yesterday to Krishnadas, and yours has come today to put the finishing touch.
('41', 230, 7, 17, 449933) 1 What a miserable show we are putting up against the insolence of Lord Birkenhead and the crookedness of the Commissioners?
('41', 230, 7, 18, 450058) I had not expected much from Sir John Simon, but I was not at all prepared for his resorting to all the known tricks of bureaucracy, and this the latest trade on untouchables adds to the ugliness of the whole picture.
('41', 230, 7, 19, 450276) However, we have to be patient.
('41', 230, 7, 20, 450308) You must therefore patiently go through the agony and mend where you can.
('41', 230, 8, 21, 450382) 1 In his letter, dated Allahabad, February 23, Jawaharlal Nehru had written: I wrote to you a few hours ago and informed you that I hoped to be in Sabarmati on Monday or Tuesday night.
('41', 230, 8, 22, 450567) Immediately after I received a summons from Delhi to go there and remain there for the next fortnight or more to assist in constitution drafting.
('41', 230, 8, 23, 450713) Personally I have had enough of this All Parties Conference.
('41', 230, 8, 24, 450774) Afte ten days of it, the strain was too great for me and I fled to avoid riot and insurrection!
('41', 230, 8, 25, 450870) I feel better already after a three day absence, but another dose of all the parties may go to my head.
('41', 230, 8, 26, 450974) I am thus not at all desirous of attending the meetings in Delhi.
('41', 230, 8, 27, 451040) But I do not know what might happen.
('41', 230, 8, 28, 451077) I shall wire to you from Delhi (S.N. 13079).

('41', 231, 1, 5, 451458) There are just four weeks of somewhat trying weather, but you could always go to Nandi Hill only 35 miles from Bangalore where you have delightfully cool weather.

('41', 231, 5, 13, 451972) Others, too, would have cabled, but do you think a man who was so seriously ill would wait till the steamer had arrived?
('41', 231, 5, 14, 452093) Even in case of such illness, therefore, it would be best for you to suppress the desire to abandon your work and run back home.
('41', 231, 5, 15, 452222) Ramdas and Nirmala have gone to Rajkot, and from there they will go to Amreli.
('41', 231, 5, 16, 452301) They have decided, both of them, to take up some work connected with my activities and devote themselves wholly to it.
('41', 231, 5, 17, 452420) The place of work too will be decided before the 16th of March.
('41', 231, 5, 18, 452484) Devdas is still here.
('41', 231, 5, 19, 452506) He is keeping well.
('41', 231, 5, 20, 452526) Brian Gabriel left for Bombay today after staying here for three days.
('41', 231, 5, 21, 452597) This letter will be carried by the same ship by which he sails.
('41', 231, 5, 22, 452661) I wish to see Sushila restored to perfect health.
('41', 231, 5, 23, 452711) Which book in English is she studying?
('41', 231, 5, 24, 452750) Send me a sample of her handwriting.
('41', 231, 5, 25, 452787) Tell Mr. Kallenbach that I am waiting for him to come.

('41', 232, 2, 4, 453040) Illness is such a thing that most often one never knows whence and how it comes.
('41', 232, 2, 5, 453121) Do not be sorry on this account, but make further introspection and be thankful to God even for the illness.
('41', 232, 2, 6, 453230) Try to remove your own shortcomings if you notice any.
('41', 232, 2, 7, 453285) Keep writing to me.

('41', 232, 6, 12, 453502) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 27, 1928
('41', 232, 7, 13, 453543) MY DEAR RITCH, I was glad to receive your long letter though a business letter.
('41', 232, 7, 14, 453623) Unlike you, I am going to commence with domestic business.
('41', 232, 7, 15, 453682) I was distressed to hear from Miss Knudsen, who by the way is staying with me at the present moment, that you had lost one of your legs.
('41', 232, 7, 16, 453819) But she was unable to give me the reason for it.
('41', 232, 7, 17, 453868) You shall give it.
('41', 232, 7, 18, 453887) And how is Mrs. Ritch doing?
('41', 232, 7, 19, 453916) And what about Erick and Harold?
('41', 232, 7, 20, 453949) The daughters names I forget.
('41', 232, 7, 21, 453979) I hope they wont accuse me of want of chivalry.
('41', 232, 7, 22, 454027) What are they all doing?
('41', 232, 7, 23, 454052) For me, I am dictating from a sick bed, not that I feel anything particular within me, but doctors have warned me against exerting myself either physically or mentally for some time yet.
('41', 232, 7, 24, 454239) Mrs. Gandhi is keeping quite well.
('41', 232, 7, 25, 454274) Harilal has practically forsaken me.
('41', 232, 7, 26, 454311) He drinks, eats and makes himself merry.
('41', 232, 7, 27, 454352) But he is a brave boy in

('41', 233, 0, 1, 454397) 234 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 233, 1, 2, 454439) one sense that he makes no secret of his vice and his rebellion is an open rebellion.
('41', 233, 1, 3, 454525) If he had not done his creditors down, I would not have minded his other lapses as I mind this betrayal of his creditors.
('41', 233, 1, 4, 454647) Manilal you know is in Phoenix and Ramdas and Devdas are assisting me in my work.
('41', 233, 1, 5, 454729) Polak is in India just now, travelling about his business.
('41', 233, 1, 6, 454788) I met him for a few minutes in Madras and he is likely to call at the Ashram before he re em barks for London.
('41', 233, 1, 7, 454899) Andrews is a frequent visitor to the Ashram and he is due here about the third of March.
('41', 233, 1, 8, 454988) This Ashram is a big, growing affair.
('41', 233, 1, 9, 455026) We are at the present moment supporting a population of about two hundred, quite a little village by ourselves.
('41', 233, 1, 10, 455138) And not only do we go through all the processes of cotton till it comes out as cloth, we are conducting a little dairy, a little tannery and we are having a little bit of farming.
('41', 233, 1, 11, 455318) We have some fruit trees and we grow our own vegetables.
('41', 233, 1, 12, 455375) We grow some grains and enough fodder for cattle.
('41', 233, 1, 13, 455425) We have as a rule one or two Europeans with us and there is a constant stream of such visitors.
('41', 233, 1, 14, 455521) Life is very simple, and yet not simple enough for the Indian setting.
('41', 233, 1, 15, 455592) You cant have any notion from that distance of the grinding poverty of the masses.
('41', 233, 1, 16, 455675) And if we could only sustain ourselves well enough for our work in less, I would straightway reduce our expenses which amount to a pound per month on an aver age including clothing but excluding rental.
('41', 233, 1, 17, 455878) Of course we are paying no rent.
('41', 233, 1, 18, 455911) We have nearly 75 boys and girls for whom we are condu cting what I may call a model school making tuitional experiments.
('41', 233, 1, 19, 456033) Now for business.
('41', 233, 1, 20, 456051) My own opinion is that neither Andrews nor Sastri could have got more than they have.
('41', 233, 1, 21, 456137) I quite agree with you that these Union Ministers will be driven to getting out of the bargain.
('41', 233, 1, 22, 456233) But if Sastri is permitted to remain in South Africa for any length of time, I am inclined to think that his correct, that is, his righteous, diplomacy will triumph over the crooked diplomacy of South Africa.
('41', 233, 1, 23, 456442) If we are to achieve the full result of the struggle of 1906 to 1914, we must act on the square and cleanse our stables, and I feel sure that if those who have entered surreptitiously will cease to be greedy, will make a clear confession and truthfully, not encourage any single fraudulent entrant in future, the position can be saved and the condition of the resident population steadily improved.
('41', 233, 1, 24, 456841) If, however, the desire is not only to cover surreptitious entries already accomplished, but to leave the door open for more, I think that the community will be unable to remain in South Africa with any degree of self respect.
('41', 233, 1, 25, 457068) It will hold on some how or other I have no doubt, it will be difficult to wipe out such a

('41', 234, 1, 2, 457201) large and resourceful community, but it would be a sordid existence; whereas I would like the Indians of South Africa to play an honourable part not merely for the upbuilding of South Africa but for the upbuilding of India itself.
('41', 234, 1, 3, 457432) If we play the game in South Africa, it is possible in course of time to secure full rights of citizenship.
('41', 234, 1, 4, 457540) You may share this letter with any friend you like.
('41', 234, 1, 5, 457592) With regards to you all,

('41', 234, 6, 10, 457751) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 234, 6, 11, 457784) The more I think of it the more confirmed I become that boycott of British goods is a useless cry.
('41', 234, 6, 12, 457883) I have not contemplated boycott of Indias mills.
('41', 234, 6, 13, 457932) All I have said about them is that they do not need any advertisement as khadi does, even as an old established trade needs no advertisement whereas a new one does.

('41', 235, 3, 5, 458451) I have not seen the Supplement which you say you have sent.
('41', 235, 3, 6, 458511) My message to you is that an Indian journal outside India has a need for double caution.
('41', 235, 3, 7, 458600) I hope that your journal instead of pandering to the evil tastes of the people wherever they exist will stand out boldly for social and moral reforms and show the emigrants that it is their duty to represent the best of Indian culture in the land to which they may migrate and to keep up the bond between themselves and the motherland by adopting khaddar at least.

('41', 236, 2, 4, 459281) It is a pretty difficult problem in which you have been caught up.
('41', 236, 2, 5, 459348) All the difficulties will be solved if you have patience and scrupulous regard for truth.
('41', 236, 2, 6, 459438) Do not, for the sake of immediate gain, lend your name to falsehood.
('41', 236, 2, 7, 459507) I have conveyed my views to Mr. Ritch.
('41', 236, 2, 8, 459546) 1 I had a long letter from him, which I have read with care.
('41', 236, 2, 9, 459607) I do believe that we can still save the situation, if only people will stop the practice of bringing in unauthorized persons.
('41', 236, 2, 10, 459733) Try to keep Sastriji for another year.
('41', 236, 2, 11, 459772) I will also try from this end.

('41', 238, 3, 9, 462835) I have in any case to reply to his wire.
('41', 238, 3, 10, 462876) If you find him a friendly person, consult him about your health too.
('41', 238, 3, 11, 462946) Swelling indicate weakness of the heart.
('41', 238, 3, 12, 462987) It is proper that you have stopped physical movements.
('41', 238, 3, 13, 463042) But you need fresh air the most.

('41', 238, 3, 16, 463128) He seems to be doing well in Aden.
('41', 238, 3, 17, 463163) He has also paid Jekis fare to Thomas Cook.
('41', 238, 3, 18, 463207) He is suffering from hydrocele and wishes to be operated upon in Aden, that is why he wants her there.
('41', 238, 3, 19, 463310) I believe that he would have called her even if he had not been suffering from the disease.
('41', 238, 3, 20, 463402) He wants the children too.
('41', 238, 3, 21, 463429) Jeki is completely at home here.
('41', 238, 3, 22, 463462) The kids are making great progress in their studies.
('41', 238, 3, 23, 463515) All of them keep fit.
('41', 238, 3, 24, 463537) But I feel that, since Manilal wants her, it is Jekis clear duty to go to Aden.
('41', 238, 3, 25, 463617) She, too, is ready to go.

('41', 239, 8, 11, 464448) I have put him on work which he had least expected and told him that he is not likely to take to the Ashram life unless he became a labourer pure and simple.
('41', 239, 8, 12, 464606) But he seems to have taken to it very gracefully and pleasantly.
('41', 239, 8, 13, 464671) Now about your donation.
('41', 239, 8, 14, 464696) I did not know that you were a pucka bania by choice.
('41', 239, 8, 15, 464750) But you little knew that you were dealing with a still more pucka bania voluntarily acting as the agent of Daridranarayana.
('41', 239, 8, 16, 464874) You say that you had announced a donation to the Ashram of Rs. 500 on the marriage of your son and you propose, to use the language of law, wrongfully to divert part of the funds to the payment of a debt voluntarily incurred by you with Sjt.
('41', 239, 8, 17, 465116) Manilal Kothari.
('41', 239, 8, 18, 465133) How can a donation be utilized for discharge of a debt whe ther moral or legal?
('41', 239, 8, 19, 465213) And what connection can you promise to pay the All India Spinners Association have with the Ashram which repres ents multifarious activitiestanning, dairying, farming, experiments in hygiene, cotton growing, ginning, carding, spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, carpentry, smithy, conducting educational experiments, looking after widows, taking care of so called untouchables, etc.?
('41', 239, 8, 20, 465598) And why such a donation, not paid on the date on which it was announced,
('41', 239, 9, 21, 465671) 1 This was a manner of greeting between Gandhiji and the addressee.

('41', 240, 1, 2, 465781) should not carry double interest in the hands of the donor who from date of announcement becomes a trustee?
('41', 240, 1, 3, 465889) You will please deal with these conundrums before I can deal with your cheque finally.
('41', 240, 1, 4, 465976) And I would ask you in deciding this question to consult Mrs. Dunichand, who, when I had the pleasure of being under your roof, was found to be less bania like than you have proved to be.

('41', 240, 6, 9, 466332) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 240, 6, 10, 466365) If you have the courage of your convictions, then of course you will not send the two boys to the school and make either private arrangements for them or send them to a national school.
('41', 240, 6, 11, 466551) I must at the same time say that I do not like the tone of the letter you adopted, and it would have been far more dignified if you had frankly told the head master that you did not send your boys because of the national declration of boycott.
('41', 240, 6, 12, 466795) The boys would have been sent out of the school, it is true; but it would have been a courted and, therefore, dignified dismissal.
('41', 240, 7, 13, 466926) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 241, 2, 3, 467096) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, February 29, 1928
('41', 241, 3, 4, 467137) DEAR MOTILALJI, Jawahar had prepared me for your letter.
('41', 241, 3, 5, 467194) 1 I am sorry that our meeting is delayed.
('41', 241, 3, 6, 467236) But I am glad that you are staying there if per chance some tangible result may be achieved.
('41', 241, 3, 7, 467329) What a sorry exhibition we are making of ourselves in the face of this organized insult to a whole people.
('41', 241, 3, 8, 467436) But I suppose we have to make the best of a very bad job.
('41', 241, 3, 9, 467494) I do hope that the Committee of twenty is being fully attended.
('41', 241, 3, 10, 467558) We are engaged in an unequal duel; on the one hand are clever whole timers acting with one mind and with the greatest deliberation; on the other we are part timers having many irons in the fire and having almost as many minds as our numbers.
('41', 241, 3, 11, 467800) My hope however is in the justness of our cause I hope your eyes are not causing you much trouble.
('41', 241, 4, 12, 467899) Yours sincerely,

('41', 241, 6, 14, 467945) 1 In his letter of February 24, Motilal Nehru had written: .
('41', 241, 6, 15, 468006) I am sorry it will not be possible for me and Jawahar to leave for Sabarmati on the 26th.
('41', 241, 6, 16, 468096) The very day that I wrote to you giving the points of agreement and disagreement between the various parties, Mr. Jinnah announced that it was wrong to say that anything had been agreed upon by the Muslim League which had not yet formally appointed its representatives to the Conference.
('41', 241, 6, 17, 468384) He added that he was no doubt personally of the opinions he had expressed, but he felt that, in the absence of definite authority from his League, he was not competent even to bind himself with those opinions.
('41', 241, 6, 18, 468594) Thus it was that the long sittings and elaborate discussions occupying ten days came practically to nothing.
('41', 241, 6, 19, 468703) It was also found that the attendance at the Conference was thinning away from day to day until it came down to 14 on the 21st.
('41', 241, 6, 20, 468831) The Executive of the Muslim League is meeting on the 26th and Mr. Jinnah has promised to do his best to bring them round to his point of view.
('41', 241, 6, 21, 468974) In all these circumstances, I thought it was futile to go on with the Conference and suggested that a sub committee be appointed to go into the whole question and make its report as soon as possible to an adjourned sitting of the Conference.
('41', 241, 6, 22, 469216) This was agreed to and the Conference was adjourned to the 8th March, a committee of 20 being appointed to enter upon their work at once.
('41', 241, 6, 23, 469354) We have a large field to cover, but will either be able to get on better after the 26th or give up the attempt.
('41', 241, 6, 24, 469466) I feel that my presence here is necessary till either of the two contingencies I have mentioned happens.
('41', 241, 6, 25, 469571) I shall write or wire as soon as I am free.

('41', 242, 2, 3, 469727) DEAR PADMARAJ BABU, I have your letter.
('41', 242, 2, 4, 469767) My views have been frequently and unequivocally expressed in the pages of Young India.
('41', 242, 2, 5, 469854) I have no notion of what is being done there at the present moment.
('41', 242, 2, 6, 469922) But I suggest your seeking advice from Pandit Malaviyaji who knows more of the inwardness of the present movement than I do lying on a sick bed.
('41', 242, 2, 7, 470067) As you will notice, therefore, I am simply satisfying myself with an expression of my general views on swadesi, boycott, and the like.
('41', 242, 3, 8, 470202) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 242, 7, 14, 470460) A chemist told me that if oil is frozen, the acid in it separates out and only the fat remains.
('41', 242, 7, 15, 470556) There was indeed good news concerning Morvi.
('41', 242, 7, 16, 470601) If Revashankerbhai agrees, we can make him the president.
('41', 242, 7, 17, 470659) If he falls ill, we can then elect someone else.
('41', 242, 7, 18, 470708) I find this the best solution.
('41', 242, 7, 19, 470739) Since Fulchand and the others have gone to Bardoli, who is helping you now?
('41', 242, 7, 20, 470815) What have you done about the Antyaja School at Morvi?

('41', 243, 5, 7, 471291) Wednesday, February 29, 1928
('41', 243, 6, 8, 471320) RESPECTED REVASHANKERBHAI, I got your letter, as also your wire.
('41', 243, 6, 9, 471385) On getting the wire, I wrote a letter to Dr. Muthu only yesterday, addressed C/o you.
('41', 243, 6, 10, 471471) You must have passed it on to him.
('41', 243, 6, 11, 471506) If you have not sent a telegram or have not been able to write a letter even today, intimating the result of his examination, inform me by wire.
('41', 243, 6, 12, 471651) I have also written to Dr. Muthu requesting him to write to me in detail.
('41', 243, 6, 13, 471725) Jeki is not at all keen on going to Aden.
('41', 243, 6, 14, 471767) She is ready to do what we advise her to do.
('41', 243, 6, 15, 471812) But we must consider what our duty is in regard to her.
('41', 243, 6, 16, 471868) Is it right for us to keep Jeki with us against Manilals wishes?
('41', 243, 6, 17, 471933) What would the doctor 2 wish in these circumstances?
('41', 243, 6, 18, 471986) If I were free to decide myself, I would certainly support Jeki in her desire not to go.
('41', 243, 6, 19, 472075) But I feel that the doctor would not wish that, nor perhaps would you.
('41', 243, 6, 20, 472146) I cannot bear to see the miserable condition of women.
('41', 243, 6, 21, 472201) I would, if I could, save every woman from the burden which her husband in his sensuality puts upon her.
('41', 243, 6, 22, 472306) However, if God let things happen according to our wishes, the world would certainly turn upside down; we should, therefore, do whatever we can while keeping ourselves detached.

('41', 244, 2, 3, 472665) I have no desire to start any hot controversy over the question of foreign propaganda, but I publish the foregoing as it summarizes the views of many workers who hold them in no sense weakly because they do not express them in public.
('41', 244, 2, 4, 472900) If the pure Non co operation of 1920 is not witnessed on an extensive scale at the present moment, it is most decidedly going deeper with some and everything that is happening today in the land goes to strengthen their belief.
('41', 244, 2, 5, 473127) But they cannot make themselves felt by being vocal in season and out of season.
('41', 244, 2, 6, 473208) On the contrary, they feel that they serve the cause of swaraj better by observing silence where they cannot serve by speech and helping humbly and actively wherever they can.

('41', 244, 3, 9, 473420) MISRULE An esteemed friend writes : 2
('41', 244, 4, 10, 473458) It is not often that I intrude upon your expressions of political opinion.
('41', 244, 4, 11, 473533) But a sentence of yours in a recent editorial, repeating a heresy uttered by you long ago, compels me to ask you whether you have measured your words with the care that one expects of an expounder of moral issues.
('41', 244, 4, 12, 473747) You declare that you would accept chaos in exchange for freedom from the English yoke.
('41', 244, 4, 13, 473834) That an Indian should desire and work for freedom from any foreign yoke is perfectly natural, normal and healthy.
('41', 244, 4, 14, 473948) That anyone in his senses should exchange any kind of orderly government for chaos is simply incomprehensible, for the one implies some sort of discipline, whether imposed or stimulated, whereas the latter is the very negation of self discipline.
('41', 244, 5, 15, 474195) If non violence be, as you claim it to be, creative, purposeful, and divine in its nature, then chaos cannot be its consequence or characteristic.
('41', 244, 5, 16, 474342) If you have used the term with deliberation, then I should comment that you have rendered no service to mankind, who need rather a reminder that they should acquire the cosmic vision rather than the chaotic one to which they are already prone.
('41', 244, 5, 17, 474586) There is no mistaking the earnestness running through the letter.
('41', 244, 5, 18, 474652) And I have so much regard for the friends views, that if I could have

('41', 245, 1, 2, 474904) suited mine to his, I would gladly have done so.
('41', 245, 2, 3, 474953) But I must say that my choice was deliberate.
('41', 245, 2, 4, 474999) Chaos means no rule, no order.
('41', 245, 2, 5, 475030) Rule or order can come, does come out of no rule or no order, but never directly out of misrule or disorder masquerading under the sacred name of rule or order.
('41', 245, 2, 6, 475191) My friends difficulty arises, I presume, out of his assumption that the present Government of India represents some sort of discipline whether imposed or stimulated.
('41', 245, 2, 7, 475357) It is likely that our estimates of the existing system differ.
('41', 245, 2, 8, 475420) My own estimate of it is that it is an unmitigated evil.
('41', 245, 2, 9, 475477) No good therefore can come out of this evil.
('41', 245, 2, 10, 475522) I hold misrule to be worse than no rule.
('41', 245, 2, 11, 475563) Nor need my words cause any confusion in the minds of the ignorant or the violent.
('41', 245, 2, 12, 475646) For I admit my correspondents contention that chaos can be the result only of violence.
('41', 245, 2, 13, 475734) Have I not often said in these pages that if I were compelled to choose between this rule and violence I would give my vote for the latter though I will not, I could not, assist a fight based on violence?
('41', 245, 2, 14, 475939) It would be a matter for me of Hobsons choice.
('41', 245, 2, 15, 475986) The seeming quiescence of today is a dangerous form of violence kept under suppression by greater violence or rather readiness for it.
('41', 245, 2, 16, 476121) Is it not better that those who, out of a cowardly fear of death or dispossession, whilst harbouring violence refrain from it, should do it and win freedom from bondage or die gloriously in the attempt to vindicate their birthright?
('41', 245, 2, 17, 476354) My non violence is not an academic principle to be enunciated on favourable occasions.
('41', 245, 2, 18, 476441) It is a principle which I am seeking to enforce every moment of my life in every field of activity.
('41', 245, 2, 19, 476541) In my attempt, often frustrated through my own weakness or ignorance, to enforce non violence, I am driven for the sake of the creed itself to countenance violence by way of giving mental approval to it.
('41', 245, 2, 20, 476745) In 1921 I told the villagers near Bettiah 1 that they had acted like cowards in that they had instead of resisting the evil minded Amlas left their wives and homes on their approach.
('41', 245, 2, 21, 476928) On another occasion I expressed myself ashamed of a priest who said he had quietly slipped away and saved himself when a ruffian band had entered his temple to loot it and break the idol.
('41', 245, 2, 22, 477116) I told him that if he could not die at his post defending his charge non violently, he should have defended it by offering violent resistance.
('41', 245, 2, 23, 477259) Similarly do I hold that, if India has no faith in non violence, nor patience for it to work its way, then it is better for her to attain her freedom from the present misrule even by

('41', 246, 1, 3, 477631) Look at the shameless manner in which, for sustaining the spoliation of India, British statesmen (?) are setting one party against another.
('41', 246, 1, 4, 477771) They have suddenly discovered the untouchables, for they seem to fear that the Hindu Muslim dissensions alone might not prove enough secu rity for retaining possession of the most glorious diadem in the British Crown.
('41', 246, 1, 5, 477989) They are trying to set the helpless princes against the people.
('41', 246, 1, 6, 478053) Sir John Simon finds it necessary to play the same game.
('41', 246, 1, 7, 478110) The penetrating intellect he is said to possess does not penetrate the very thin veil that covers the frauds that are set up for his edification and he finds nothing seriously amiss in the Indian atmosphere.
('41', 246, 1, 8, 478318) This sort of orderly discipline has unmanned and unn erved the people as nothing in their previous history has ever done.
('41', 246, 1, 9, 478440) My own position and belief are clear and unequivocal.
('41', 246, 1, 10, 478494) I neither want the existing rule nor chaos.
('41', 246, 1, 11, 478538) I want true order established without having to go through the travail of chaos.
('41', 246, 1, 12, 478619) I want this disorder to be destroyed by non violence, i.e., I want to convert the evil doers.
('41', 246, 1, 13, 478713) My life is dedicated to that task.
('41', 246, 1, 14, 478748) And what I have written in the previous paragraphs directly flows from my knowledge of the working of non violence which is the greatest force known to mankind.
('41', 246, 1, 15, 478909) My belief in its efficacy is unshakable, so is my belief unshakable in the power of India to gain her freedom through non violent means and no other.
('41', 246, 1, 16, 479059) But this power of hers cannot be evoked by suppressing truth or facts however ugly they may for the moment appear to be.
('41', 246, 1, 17, 479180) God forbid that India should have to engage in a sanguinary duel before she learns the lesson of non violence in its fullness.
('41', 246, 1, 18, 479307) But if that intermediate stage, often found to be necessary, is to be her lot, it will have to be faced as a stage inevitable in her march towards freedom and certainly preferable to the existing order which is only so called but which is like a whited sepulchre hiding undiluted violence underneath.

('41', 247, 4, 10, 480956) It is not suggested that a study of all the foregoing literature is necessary for the lover of the cow or even that it is all valuable.

('41', 247, 6, 14, 481187) Dr. Ray gave me soon after his recent visit to Meerut an account of his impressions.
('41', 247, 6, 15, 481272) I take the following from his letter : 3
('41', 247, 7, 16, 481313) I was taken to a village 20 miles north of the town where the peasants are comparatively prosperous.
('41', 247, 7, 17, 481414) In almost every house I visited the mother, the daughter and sometimes the daughter in law were found basking in the sun and spinning 10 to 12 count yarns.
('41', 247, 7, 18, 481570) The coarse cloth woven in the village itself is used by the local people and ready made sliver hawked about.
('41', 247, 7, 19, 481679) In the field also side by side with the standing crops there are patches of cotton cultivation.

('41', 248, 1, 3, 482100) The Banaras Gandhi Ashram with the help of a local band of devoted sacrificing workers is doing its level best but funds and proper organization are both badly needed.
('41', 248, 1, 4, 482268) The hum of the wheel need not die either in the Punjab or elsewhere in India, if we would be true to our trust.
('41', 248, 1, 5, 482380) The band of workers from the Banaras Ashram who attracted Dr. Rays attention are working in and near that district to put khadi on a stable foo ting.
('41', 248, 1, 6, 482530) Now that he parent of the Ashram, Acharya Kripalani, is in the midst of his workers, there should be redoubled zeal on their part and greater support and appreciation from the public.

('41', 248, 3, 9, 482808) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('41', 248, 3, 10, 482841) I am happy to learn that there has been some improvement in Nikhils health.
('41', 248, 3, 11, 482917) Rest and water treatment may bring about a complete cure.
('41', 248, 3, 12, 482975) Study the Ramayana well.
('41', 248, 3, 13, 483000) Recite the quatrains and couplets over and over again and meditate on them.
('41', 248, 3, 14, 483076) Keep your mind absolutely calm and never give way to depression.
('41', 248, 3, 15, 483141) This is the teaching of Gita.
('41', 248, 3, 16, 483171) This is the purpose of Ramanama.
('41', 248, 3, 17, 483204) Those blessed by God do not regard sorrow as sorrow.
('41', 248, 3, 18, 483257) Daily we chant here the verse :
('41', 248, 4, 19, 483289) It means that sorrow is not sorrow, happiness is not happiness.
('41', 248, 4, 20, 483353) Sorrow is forgetting Vishnu; happiness is remembering Narayana.
('41', 248, 4, 21, 483417) He who has Narayana in his heart, how can he know sorrow?

('41', 249, 2, 3, 483797) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, March 3, 1928
('41', 249, 3, 4, 483834) DEAR MOTILALJI, I have your letter.
('41', 249, 3, 5, 483870) I have discussed it with Jawaharlal, but he suggests, and I agree, that it will be better for me to reduce to writing the views I have expressed to him so that there may be no misunderstanding about the correct interpretation of my views, and so that he may also know whether he understood me correctly.
('41', 249, 3, 6, 484174) ELECTORATE: I am of the same opinion that I expressed years ago at Delhi that we should not be party to separate electorates or to reservation of seats, the latter should be by mutual voluntary arran gement if such is necessary.
('41', 249, 3, 7, 484403) But unless the Mussalmans agree, there is no going back by us on reservation of seats.
('41', 249, 3, 8, 484490) The Congress is committed to it.
('41', 249, 3, 9, 484523) I think, therefore, that we must simply adhere to the Congress resolution and expect Hindus and Mussalmans to carry out that resolution.
('41', 249, 3, 10, 484660) If the All Parties Conference cannot discover another method acceptable to all, we must simply work out the Congress formula.
('41', 249, 3, 11, 484786) THE C ONSTITUTION: Personally I am of opinion that we are not ready for drawing up a constitution till we have developed sanction for ourselves.
('41', 249, 3, 12, 484931) Any constitution that we may arrive at must be a final thing in the sense that we may improve upon but we may not recede from it even by an inch.
('41', 249, 3, 13, 485077) There seems to be no atmosphere for arriving at such a constitution.
('41', 249, 3, 14, 485146) I would personally therefore prefer instead of a constitution, a working arrangement between all parties upon which all may be agreed.
('41', 249, 3, 15, 485281) This would be not a constitution but chief heads of it, as for instance, the Hindu Muslim arrangement, the franchise, the policy as to the Native States.
('41', 249, 3, 16, 485435) If we are to make this thing popular, I should bring in total prohibition and exclusion of foreign cloth as an indispensable condition.
('41', 249, 3, 17, 485571) Of course we should guarantee equality of treatment of all religions as also of the so called untouchables.
('41', 249, 3, 18, 485679) I am not exhaustive in the list of things on which there should be an agreement, but I have simply given a few things by way of illustration.
('41', 249, 3, 19, 485821) I think that if we go beyond such a general agreement, we would be making mistake.
('41', 249, 3, 20, 485904) In any case, I do hope that the Conference will not break up without doing anything, and even if it does, the Working
('41', 250, 0, 1, 486022) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 251
('41', 250, 1, 2, 486064) Committee should take the matter in its own hands and issue its own authoritative statement on behalf of the Congress on all the matters for which the Conference has been convened.
('41', 250, 1, 3, 486245) SANCTION: More important than the two foregoing things, in my opinion, is the sanction.
('41', 250, 1, 4, 486333) Unless we have created some force ourselves, we shall not advance beyond the position of beggars, and I have given all my time to thinking over this one question, and I can think of nothing else but boycott of foreign cloth with the assistance of mills if possible, without if necessary.
('41', 250, 1, 5, 486621) I hold it to be prefectly capable of attainment within a measurable distance of time if we can create sufficient public opinion in its favour.
('41', 250, 1, 6, 486764) Iwould have exclusive concen tration upon this thing if I had my way.
('41', 250, 1, 7, 486834) Though I have said nothing in public, I do not at all like what is going on in Bengal.
('41', 250, 1, 8, 486921) So far as I can see, it is doomed to failure and I can see much harm coming out of that failure; and unlike boycott of foreign cloth, it is valueless, unless it succeeds to the extent we want.
('41', 250, 1, 9, 487114) Jawaharlal and I have given most of our time to a consideration of this question.
('41', 250, 1, 10, 487196) And he will explain it all to you.
('41', 250, 1, 11, 487231) As soon as he can be dispensed with, I would like you to send him back for further discussion of this problem if we do not finish before he leaves for Delhi.
('41', 250, 1, 12, 487389) I see that I am not to expect you here in the near future.
('41', 250, 2, 13, 487448) Yours sincerely,

('41', 251, 2, 3, 487837) It was necessary to undertake such work in Gujarat.
('41', 251, 2, 4, 487889) Now that it has begun, it will help in creating a khadi atmosphere if it gains a foothold.
('41', 251, 2, 5, 487980) I take it for granted that help from local workers will be available everywhere in Gujarat.

('41', 251, 3, 7, 488108) 282. CATTLE IN KATHIAWAR An expert in cattle breeding writes from Kathiawar to say : 2
('41', 251, 4, 8, 488195) This letter deserves the attention of rulers (of Indian States) and their officers.
('41', 251, 4, 9, 488279) The several methods of cattle protection shown here have been discussed in various ways in the letter itself.
('41', 251, 4, 10, 488389) However, I mention them here as they have been stated with reference to the local conditions by a person who has lived in Kathiawar.
('41', 251, 4, 11, 488522) The cows and bullocks of Kathiawar were at one time famous.
('41', 251, 4, 12, 488582) It is a matter of shame for every State in Kathiawar that today they are being sent to the slaughter house and that economically they are regarded as a burden.
('41', 251, 4, 13, 488742) This reform requires neither a large sum of money nor any great courage.
('41', 251, 4, 14, 488815) It is only a matter of giving up lethargy and sparing a little time from politics.
('41', 251, 4, 15, 488898) It requires no great effort to get scrub bulls castrated or to regulate cattle fodder.
('41', 251, 4, 16, 488985) The States should train some students by offering them scholarships.
('41', 251, 4, 17, 489054) In the mean while, they should carry on the work with whatever help they can get.
('41', 251, 4, 18, 489136) The heads of pinjrapoles too should take note of the above suggestions.
('41', 251, 4, 19, 489208) Infirm cattle ought to be looked after.
('41', 251, 4, 20, 489248) However, it is a thousand times more important to prevent useful cattle from being sent to the slaughter house.

('41', 252, 1, 2, 489573) 283. SATYAGRAHA IN BARDOLI In this issue the reader will find the letters exchanged between the Government and Shri Vallabhbhai.
('41', 252, 1, 3, 489702) In a way this correspondence is a sorry chapter.
('41', 252, 1, 4, 489751) So far as I can see, the facts mentioned by Shri Vallabhbhai or the arguments that he has based on them lack nothing.
('41', 252, 1, 5, 489869) The Governments reply is marked by cunning and equivocation and amounts to a snub.
('41', 252, 1, 6, 489952) It makes one sad that power thus makes a person arrogant and that he in his arrogance loses his humanity and forgets himself.
('41', 252, 1, 7, 490078) Although we may have known thousands of such instances of human weakness, each new one is bound to cause pain.
('41', 252, 1, 8, 490189) This is because though man is not free from fault, at heart he wants to do good.
('41', 252, 1, 9, 490270) Hence he is pained by insolence, discourtesy, etc., from others.
('41', 252, 1, 10, 490335) I shall not enter into the correctness or otherwise of the facts and the arguments.
('41', 252, 1, 11, 490419) The reader may not have before him all the literature which would enable him to examine the pros and cons; if he has it, he may not have the patience to read and reflect upon it.
('41', 252, 1, 12, 490598) However, Shri Vallabhbhais demands will be found reasonable by the disinterested reader even on the basis of justice alone.
('41', 252, 1, 13, 490722) Vallabhbhai does not insist that his arguments should be accepted by the Government.
('41', 252, 1, 14, 490807) What he in fact says is that, while the Government is on one side, the people are on the other.
('41', 252, 1, 15, 490903) There is a difference of opinion between the two regarding the facts themselves.
('41', 252, 1, 16, 490984) There should be a third party to arbitrate in this dispute.
('41', 252, 1, 17, 491044) Whatever award is given by this party will be accepted by Vallabhbhai on behalf of the people.
('41', 252, 1, 18, 491139) This is the crux, the essence, of Vallabhbhais letter.
('41', 252, 1, 19, 491194) The question that now arises is whether there could be such arbitration to settle disputes between the Government and the people.
('41', 252, 1, 20, 491324) Is not the former the supreme authority?
('41', 252, 1, 21, 491365) In matters relating to law, even this Government is theoretically prepared to stand in the dock in a court of law.
('41', 252, 1, 22, 491480) The Government regards the question of land revenue as extra judicial.The reason for this is beyond the common mans powers of comprehension.
('41', 252, 1, 23, 491621) Let us not enter into the intricacies of this argument at this moment.
('41', 252, 1, 24, 491692) However, if the question of land revenue is outside the juris diction of courts, what could Vallabhbhai do but ask for arbitration?
('41', 252, 1, 25, 491824) Should he advise the people to appeal to the Government and then sit quiet?
('41', 252, 1, 26, 491900) Even if he wished to give such advice, the people had not left the door open to him; they had already appealed to the Government.
('41', 253, 0, 1, 492030) 254 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 253, 1, 2, 492072) Vallabhbhai would not help them make such appeals, so they approached those who would.
('41', 253, 1, 3, 492159) Having been unsuccessful there, they returned to Vallabhbhai to make him accept their leadership in offering satyagraha.
('41', 253, 1, 4, 492280) In accordance with the rules of satyagraha, Vallabhbhai approached the Government with a polite offer of peace.
('41', 253, 1, 5, 492392) He said that the Government might not be wrong, it was possible that the people might have misled him.
('41', 253, 1, 6, 492495) He asked the Government to appoint an arbitrator and ask him to dispense justice.
('41', 253, 1, 7, 492577) He hoped the Government would not claim infallibility.
('41', 253, 1, 8, 492632) The Government, by committing the grave mistake of rejecting this proposal, cleared the way for the people to offer satyagraha.
('41', 253, 1, 9, 492760) The Government, however, claims that Vallabhbhai is an outsider and does not belong there, that he is an alien and, if he and his alien friends had not entered Bardoli, people would have certainly paid up the revenuethat is the trend of the Governments letter.
('41', 253, 1, 10, 493021) This is like the thief trying to punish the policeman.
('41', 253, 1, 11, 493076) As long as Bardoli is in India neither Vallabhbhai nor anyone else amongst us will understand how either he or any Indian living within the territory between Kashmir in the north and Kanyakumari in the south and between Karachi in the west and Dibrugarh in the east, can be called an outsider.
('41', 253, 1, 12, 493370) It is the British officers of the Government who are foreigners, outsiders who do not belong here, and, to speak more plainly, all the officerswhether they are black or whitewho serve this foreign, outside authority belong to this category.
('41', 253, 1, 13, 493611) Those who owe their livelihood to the Government would of course be on its side.
('41', 253, 1, 14, 493692) Even persons like Drona and Bhishma had to tell Yudhishthira that they were on the side of those who provided them their livelihood.
('41', 253, 1, 15, 493825) How crooked of this foreign Government, to call a person like Vallabhbhai an outsider in Bardoli!
('41', 253, 1, 16, 493923) This is like darkness at noon!
('41', 253, 1, 17, 493954) It is because of such things that people like me regard it a sin to be loyal to such a Government, and practise non co operation.
('41', 253, 1, 18, 494084) How can we hope for any justice where such gross impertinence prevails?
('41', 253, 1, 19, 494156) Who can teach justice to this Government?
('41', 253, 1, 20, 494198) Only a satyagrahi.
('41', 253, 1, 21, 494217) The Govern ment cannot be vanquished by intellectual arguments.
('41', 253, 1, 22, 494281) For the mighty, reason lies in might.
('41', 253, 1, 23, 494319) It weighs justice at the point of the sword.
('41', 253, 1, 24, 494364) This sword becomes blunt when it meets the sword of the satyagrahi.
('41', 253, 1, 25, 494432) If the satyagrahis of Bardoli are capable of standing by
('41', 254, 0, 1, 494489) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 255
('41', 254, 1, 2, 494531) truth, either an arbitrator will be appointed, or Vallabhbhais arguments will be accepted and he will cease to be considered an outsider and come to be accepted as a native.
('41', 254, 1, 3, 494705) The other questions arising out of this correspondence will be dealt with later.
('41', 254, 1, 4, 494786) It is enough for the people of Bardoli to remember that it is for them to win or lose the game.

('41', 255, 3, 4, 495947) DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your letter and money order for Rs. 50. Will you please convey my thanks to the students and tell them that I hope this is merely the first instalment of their gift on behalf of Daridranarayana and that they are wearing khaddar habitually?

('41', 255, 8, 10, 496387) MY DEAR BHASKARAN, I was glad to receive your letter.
('41', 255, 8, 11, 496441) Of course I forgive you for all the mischief you have done.
('41', 255, 8, 12, 496501) But your letter only confirms what I heard about you, and it was undoubtedly wrong.
('41', 255, 8, 13, 496585) You now ask me with my influence to restore the money that you withdrew and say that you will accept penance in the way of fasting and what not.
('41', 255, 8, 14, 496730) That would not be correct penance.
('41', 255, 8, 15, 496765) You must now submit to what Ramanathan or Rajaji may say without in any way being influenced by me.
('41', 255, 8, 16, 496865) That is the correct position for you to take.
('41', 255, 8, 17, 496911) And, if you cant have the money restored you should submit to their judgment cheerfully and expect to earn it by honest means in future.
('41', 255, 9, 18, 497048) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 257, 3, 4, 498136) DEAR FRIEND, I have your kind letter enclosing your donation, for both of which I thank you.
('41', 257, 3, 5, 498229) There was no occasion for you to apologize for the smallness of the donation.
('41', 257, 3, 6, 498307) The smallest donation in monetary value is a big thing when it comes from a big heart as I am sure yours has done.
('41', 257, 3, 7, 498422) The question of reform of the legal profession is a big one.
('41', 257, 3, 8, 498483) It does not admit of tinkering.
('41', 257, 3, 9, 498515) I am strongly of opinion that lawyers and doctors should not be able to charge any fees but that they should be paid a certain fixed sum by the State and the public should receive their services free.
('41', 257, 3, 10, 498716) They will have paid for them through the taxation that they would have paid for such services rendered to citizens automatically.
('41', 257, 3, 11, 498846) The poor will be untaxed but the rich and the poor will have then the same amount of attention and skill.
('41', 257, 3, 12, 498952) Today the best legal talents and the best medical advice are unobtainable by the poor.

('41', 257, 7, 18, 499245) The resolutions seem to be good.
('41', 257, 7, 19, 499278) I hope they will be followed up by action.
('41', 257, 7, 20, 499321) I do not like the idea of having the membership open to those who may love khadi or work for it for pay even though they may not wear it.

('41', 258, 1, 2, 499540) 292. WAR AGAINST WAR A correspondent writes:
('41', 258, 2, 3, 499585) My excuse for writing this is that the autobiographical chapter about your attitude towards war as a follower of truth and ahimsa has apparently stirred the thoughts of many, and abler people would be writing to you about it.
('41', 258, 2, 4, 499811) But I wish to present some aspects that have struck me.
('41', 258, 2, 5, 499867) Is it not a fundamental doctrine that to the true disciple of truth and ahimsa, there can be no tampering with bad things even though one connot resist them?
('41', 258, 2, 6, 500025) War is a necessary evil as some say, but that is no excuse for supporting it in the hope that after it there will come to the world a realization of the wickedness of waging war.
('41', 258, 2, 7, 500204) It cannot be.
('41', 258, 2, 8, 500218) On the contrary, the callousness of man is increased further in intensity and the feeling about the sacredness of life is destroyed.
('41', 258, 2, 9, 500351) The anarchist could argue just as you do and say: We cannot stop European aggression and terrorism.
('41', 258, 2, 10, 500451) We cannot resist terrorism by mass force.
('41', 258, 2, 11, 500493) But if we can only domonstrate to them the wickedness of such methods by using them against them, they will see the folly of their attitude and we shall become free, and we shall also save the world from terrorism.
('41', 258, 2, 12, 500708) So long as himsa is resorted to by our rulers and so long as we hate terrorism, what is the harm in using these weapons provided we do not allow them to obsess us? Has the Great War actually done any good to the nations and particularly to the victors?
('41', 258, 2, 13, 500961) Materially, morally, and socially they have lost heavily as a result of the victory.
('41', 258, 2, 14, 501046) Their moral standards have all been upset and the strife after the life of the moment, and the disregard for truth and honesty in international dealings is becoming more and more apparent every day.
('41', 258, 2, 15, 501245) Can any good come out of a war, however righteous it may be?
('41', 258, 2, 16, 501306) Are we not bound to oppose it and invite suffering for the cause rather than in any way acquiesce in it either passively or actively?
('41', 258, 2, 17, 501440) Do you not believe that the pacifists served the cause better than those who actively engaged in the War?
('41', 258, 2, 18, 501546) What you say might represent the state of your mind in 1914 when you thought there was a sense of justice in the British mentality.
('41', 258, 2, 19, 501678) Do you now feel that it was right?
('41', 258, 2, 20, 501713) If another war was declared tomorrow, would you volunteer your help to England in the hope that you would be making things better after the war?
('41', 258, 2, 21, 501858) I know I have not presented the case in the best way but you can understand what it is that I am trying to tell you, and I shall be glad to have your reply.
('41', 258, 2, 22, 502015) I agree with the correspondent that he has not presented his case in the best way, but he does represent a type of readers who will not read carefully even writings that are meant to be serious simply because they happen to be found in a weekly journal.
('41', 258, 2, 23, 502269) If readers like
('41', 259, 0, 1, 502285) 260 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 259, 1, 2, 502327) the correspondent will re read the chapter in question they will be able to deduce from it that: 1. I did not offer my services because I believed in war.
('41', 259, 1, 3, 502482) I offered them because I could not avoid participation in it at least indirectly.
('41', 259, 1, 4, 502564) 2. I had no status to resist participation.
('41', 259, 1, 5, 502608) 3. I do not believe that war can be avoided by taking part in it even as I do not believe that evil can be avoided by participation in it.
('41', 259, 1, 6, 502747) This however needs to be distinguished from sincerely helpless participation in many things we hold to be evil or undersirable.
('41', 259, 1, 7, 502875) 4. The anarchists argument is irrelevant as his participation in terrorism is deliberate, voluntary and preconceived.
('41', 259, 1, 8, 502993) 5. The War certainly did no good to the so called victors.
('41', 259, 1, 9, 503052) 6. The pacifist resisters who suffered imprisonment certainly served the cause of peace.
('41', 259, 1, 10, 503141) 7. If another war was declared tomorrow I could not with my present views about the existing Government assist it in any shape or form; on the contrary, I should exert myself to the utmost to induce others to withhold their assistance and to do everything possible and consistent with ahimsa to bring about its defeat.

('41', 259, 4, 13, 503506) This creation of Raja Mahendra Pratap has a proud record and is one of the very few pre non co operation institutions that were created and have lived without Government aid, recognition or affiliation.
('41', 259, 4, 14, 503709) Like all such undertakings it has had to pass through many vicissitudes but has come out scatheless through them all.
('41', 259, 4, 15, 503827) Recently it celebrated its anniversary.
('41', 259, 4, 16, 503867) Dr. Ansari presided on the occasion.
('41', 259, 4, 17, 503904) The report before me states that the proceedings began with a takli demonstration and hoisting of the national flag by Dr. Ansari and singing of the flag song by the volunteers of the Hindustani Seva Dal followed by Vande Mataram.
('41', 259, 4, 18, 504135) The report then proceeds : 1

('41', 260, 1, 4, 504573) But it is understood that though Sjt.

('41', 260, 3, 8, 504813) THE SUPREME ARBITER In answer to the blind adherence one often sees given to everything written in Sanskrit verse and going under the name of Shastra, Sjt.
('41', 260, 3, 9, 504969) S. D. Nadkarni sends me the following verses taken from sources universally regarded as authoritative and supporting the final authority of reason :
('41', 260, 4, 10, 505118) A Shastra, though man made, should be accepted, if it appeals to reason; and the contrary one rejected, though claiming to be inspired.
('41', 260, 4, 11, 505254) We should be guided by our sense of the just alone.
('41', 260, 4, 12, 505306) A saying sound in reason should be accepted, though it proceed from a child; and the contrary one rejected as a straw, though it purport to proceed from the God Brahma.
('41', 260, 5, 13, 505475) From Yogavasishtha (Nyaya prakaranam )
('41', 260, 6, 14, 505514) A convention adopted by the good shall be as good an authority as the Veda.
('41', 260, 7, 15, 505590) From the Madhava Smriti (otherwise called the Madhaviya Vyakhya ) The verses show that the Shastras were never intended to supplant reason but to supplement it and never could be pleaded in defence of injustice or untruth.
('41', 260, 8, 16, 505813) FOR THOSE WHO WOULD SUCCEED
('41', 260, 9, 17, 505841) There is so much despondency on the one hand and bluster retarding success on the other, that I gladly reproduce the following maxims handed by a friend and intended to cheer the despondent and warn the blusteres.
('41', 260, 9, 18, 506055) There is practically nothing impossible for those
('41', 261, 0, 1, 506105) 262 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 261, 1, 2, 506147) who would persevere in the face of the heaviest odds.
('41', 261, 1, 3, 506201) Nothing is possible for those who would brag, bluster and merely make a brave show.
('41', 261, 1, 4, 506285) Here are the maxims:
('41', 261, 2, 5, 506306) Every noble work is at first impossible.
('41', 261, 2, 6, 506347) CARLYLE
('41', 261, 3, 7, 506355) Success in most things depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed.
('41', 261, 3, 8, 506427) MONTESQUIEU Victory belongs to most persevering.
('41', 261, 3, 9, 506476) NAPOLEON
('41', 261, 4, 10, 506485) Perpetual pushing and assurance put a difficulty out of countenance, and make a seeming impossibility give way.
('41', 261, 4, 11, 506597) JEREMY COLLIER
('41', 261, 5, 12, 506612) Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.
('41', 261, 5, 13, 506653) The nerve that never relaxes, the eye that never blanches, the thought that never wanders, these are the masters of victory.
('41', 261, 6, 14, 506778) However discordant or troubled you have been during the day, do not go to sleep until you have restored your mental balance, until your faculties are poised and your mind serene.

('41', 261, 8, 18, 507154) Lord Sinhas contribution to the making of modern India will always rank high whenever the estimate of such contributions comes to be made.
('41', 261, 8, 19, 507293) His advice in all matters of State was always sought and esteemed.

('41', 261, 8, 21, 507409) A GREAT REFORMER Death has removed from the public life of Gujarat in Sir Ramanbhai Nilkanth a man of great purity of character, a reformer of equally great zeal and intrepidity, a public worker of singular constancy and a scholar who has made a permanent contribution to Gujarati literature.

('41', 262, 1, 2, 507898) 296. BARDOLI AND GOVERNMENT The illuminating correspondence that has passed between Sjt.
('41', 262, 1, 3, 507987) Vallabhbhai Patel and the Government of Bombay regard ing the assessment in the Bardoli Taluk affords food for reflection to the public worker and reveals in its true light the nature of the Government under which we are living.
('41', 262, 1, 4, 508216) Vallabhbhai is not unknown to fame or to the Government.
('41', 262, 1, 5, 508273) They have been obliged to acknowledge his worth as a public worker of great capacity, integrity and industry.
('41', 262, 1, 6, 508383) They have acknowledged his great work in the Munici pality of Ahmedabad.
('41', 262, 1, 7, 508456) Only the other day he received unstinted praise for his philanthropic services in connection with the floods in Gujarat.
('41', 262, 1, 8, 508577) But his work seems to have counted for nothing when they found him engaged in an activity calculated to cause them embarrass ment and possibly loss of prestige and what is the same thing to them loss of land revenue.
('41', 262, 1, 9, 508794) Their prestige they need for the sake of their revenue.
('41', 262, 1, 10, 508850) They are no believers in empty prestige.
('41', 262, 1, 11, 508891) And so in their very first letter in the matter, they thought it becoming to insult Sjt.
('41', 262, 1, 12, 508980) Vallabhbhai by calling in question his profess ions of goodwill and describing him as an outsider in Bardoli.
('41', 262, 1, 13, 509090) The last letter emphasizes the insult by leaving no doubt that His Excellency the Governor too was party to it.
('41', 262, 1, 14, 509202) Vallabhbhai had courteously assumed in his letter that whilst His Excellency might be identified with a policy enunciated in Government communications, he need not be identified with the manner of expression, more especially the insulting language often adopted by civilian secretaries incensed over any the least resistance or independence betrayed by the public in their correspondence with them.
('41', 262, 1, 15, 509601) That the Governor has chosen to become a party to the unwarranted insult shows how difficult it is for Governors, however well intentioned and impartial they may be reputed to be as the present Governor is, to escape the bureaucratic coil.
('41', 262, 1, 16, 509841) Pride goeth before destruction and haughtiness before a fall. But Vallabhbhai has a back broad enough to bear the wordy insults that the bureaucracy may choose to heap upon him from its safe and entrenched heights.
('41', 262, 1, 17, 510056) My reason for dwelling on the insult is to draw attention to the utterly irresponsible nature of the Government that dares to insult a public worker of the foremost rank.
('41', 262, 1, 18, 510227) But let us see for the moment what it is that has upset the Government.
('41', 262, 1, 19, 510299) Land revenue is a close preserve beyond the pale of law such as it is.
('41', 262, 1, 20, 510370) The regulation of assessment rests entirely with the executive authority.
('41', 262, 1, 21, 510444) Every attempt hitherto made to bring it under
('41', 263, 0, 1, 510490) 264 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 263, 1, 2, 510532) popular or judicial control has failed The Government must somehow or other meet the ever growing expenditure, bulk of which is military.
('41', 263, 1, 3, 510670) Land revenue lends itself to arbitrary increase as it affects the largest class and a class that has no voice, a class that can be squeezed without wincing.
('41', 263, 1, 4, 510827) There would be an end to irresponsible government if the governed are either allowed to have a say in their taxation or to resist it successfully.
('41', 263, 1, 5, 510974) Bardoli does not appreciate the increase made in its assessment.
('41', 263, 1, 6, 511039) Its people approached the Government with petitions and exhausted all the means that are regarded as constitutional to secure redress.
('41', 263, 1, 7, 511174) Having failed they invited Vallabhbhai to advise them and if necessary to lead them in resisting the Government through satyagraha.
('41', 263, 1, 8, 511306) Vallabhbhai investigated their case and though he found it to be just, sought to approach the Government with a view to save them embarrassment and spare the people prolonged suffering and suggested and honourable course, i.e., suggested that if the Government did not admit the justice of the peoples case, they should appoint an impartial tribunal to investigate the case on either side and assured the Government that the people would abide by the decision of such a tribunal.
('41', 263, 1, 9, 511786) This reasonable suggestion the Govern ment has scornfully rejected.
('41', 263, 1, 10, 511854) The public, therefore, are not called upon to accept the popular version as against that of the Government.
('41', 263, 1, 11, 511962) They are asked merely to support the demand for the appointment of an impartial tribunal and failing such appointment to support their heroic resolve peacefully to resist the assessment and suffer all the consequences of such resistance even including confiscation of their land.
('41', 263, 1, 12, 512242) Vallabhbhai has rightly distinguished the proposed saty agraha from the swaraj satyagraha.
('41', 263, 1, 13, 512333) This campaign cannot be properly deemed to be a no tax campaign launched for the attainment of swaraj as Bardoli would have done in 1922. This satyagraha is limited in scope, has a specific local object.
('41', 263, 1, 14, 512537) Every man has the right, nay, it is his duty to resist an arbitrary unjust levy as the Bardoli assessment is claimed to be by its ryots.
('41', 263, 1, 15, 512674) But though the object of the proposed satyagraha is local and specific, it has an all India application.
('41', 263, 1, 16, 512779) what is true of Bardoli is true of many parts of India.
('41', 263, 1, 17, 512835) The struggle has also an indirect bearing on swaraj Whatever awakens people to a sense of their wrongs and whatever gives them strength for disciplined and peaceful resistance and habituates them for corporate suffering brings us nearer swaraj.

('41', 265, 3, 5, 514141) Mr. Hodge tells me that you were complaining of absence of acknowledgment from me of the handwoven scarf you have kindly sent me as also your two papers on the banking system.
('41', 265, 3, 6, 514317) I have a vivid recollection that when I was convalescing in Bangalore last year I sent you a brief note of thanks.

('41', 266, 3, 6, 515234) As I have explained, I wish to take a change and also do my work at the same time, and I have been writing to friends with that end in view.

('41', 266, 8, 14, 515699) RESPECTED REVASHANKERBHAI,
('41', 266, 9, 15, 515726) I had asked Mahadev to write to you but I am afraid that he forgot to mention one thing in the letter.
('41', 266, 9, 16, 515829) Mahadev is not here so that I can ask him.
('41', 266, 9, 17, 515872) I wanted him to write about Dr. Ansari.
('41', 266, 9, 18, 515912) There is no doubt that Dr. Ansari is a very intelligent man, but he has no special knowledge of this subject.
('41', 266, 9, 19, 516022) He has a high opinion of a Swiss doctors remedy, which consists in serum drawn from many horses.
('41', 266, 9, 20, 516119) That doctor charges 1,000 for one tube, but the serum does not necessarily benefit everyone.
('41', 266, 9, 21, 516212) Nor do all doctors in Europe accept this mans treatment as scientific.
('41', 266, 9, 22, 516283) I dont think we need go in for it.
('41', 266, 9, 23, 516318) We should put Dhiru in the hands of a good doctor and then rest content.
('41', 266, 9, 24, 516391) I have now started taking milk.
('41', 266, 9, 25, 516423) I keep good health.

('41', 267, 3, 4, 516641) DEAR SATIS BABU, I have your two letters.
('41', 267, 3, 5, 516683) They only confirm the fears that were raised in me on reading the sensational reports about boycott and I feel sorry that Dr. Ray signed the manifesto which he knew was perfectly useless.
('41', 267, 3, 6, 516871) I do not like the proposal contained in your article.
('41', 267, 3, 7, 516925) I think we must not be mixed up with the use of foreign yarn under any circumstances whatsoever.
('41', 267, 3, 8, 517022) We must leave it to regulate itself or to those who have not a living faith in khadi.
('41', 267, 3, 9, 517108) If we mix ourselves up with the use of foreign yarn, you will see that we shall have surren dered our position.
('41', 267, 3, 10, 517220) I want you to consider this well and confine your assistance and activity to the supply of khadi if they want it.
('41', 267, 3, 11, 517334) Our own mills may come in if they wish to and if they will develop the national spirit.
('41', 267, 3, 12, 517422) But even there, our institution will have to be most cautious.
('41', 267, 3, 13, 517485) I am glad that Hemprabhadevi, Nikhil and Tarini have gone to Giridih.
('41', 267, 3, 14, 517555) I received a very despondent letter from Hemprabhadevi.
('41', 267, 3, 15, 517611) She was herself reported to be unwell.

('41', 267, 8, 22, 517939) You will be interested to learn that there is no hospital and no institution where there is a ward endowed in my name.
('41', 267, 8, 23, 518058) If there was, it would be a fraud.

('41', 268, 1, 2, 518197) farthing to pay for it.
('41', 268, 1, 3, 518221) If I can induce friends to endow wards of beds, the endowment should be in their names.
('41', 268, 1, 4, 518309) But I can think of none of whom I can speak about endowing a hospital ward.
('41', 268, 1, 5, 518385) All influence is exhausted in asking them to endow spinning wheels and institutions for the so called un touchables or for a member of the dumb creation, the cow.

('41', 268, 6, 13, 518889) Kothari is not as lenient as I am and, unless you pay your debt to him in time, he is likely to charge a proper bania interest and I shouldnt wonder if he insists upon compound interest.
('41', 268, 6, 14, 519076) About Lala Suraj Bhanu, I see that the Managing Board here are disinclined to let him come with his wife.
('41', 268, 6, 15, 519182) A letter is being posted to him with reasons for their decision.

('41', 269, 7, 15, 520381) For I am myself living on public charity.
('41', 269, 7, 16, 520423) I may not use Ashram funds for a private purpose.
('41', 269, 7, 17, 520473) It is no [small] indulgence that I give myself the benefit of expert assistance and advice which I cannot place equally easily at the disposal of every inmate of the Ashram.

('41', 271, 9, 19, 523260) THE LATE SIR RAMANBHAI Sir Ramanbhai has passed away leaving Gujarat in tears.
('41', 271, 9, 20, 523339) Ramanbhai embodies the history of modernism in Gujarat.
('41', 271, 9, 21, 523395) Ramanbhai stands for social reform.
('41', 271, 9, 22, 523431) Ramanbhai was the friend of the poor.
('41', 271, 9, 23, 523469) He was the warp and woof of the civic life of Ahmedabad.
('41', 271, 9, 24, 523526) His service to the Gujarati language was of a very high standard.
('41', 271, 9, 25, 523592) His high moral code never failed to leave an impression on whosoever came into contact with him.
('41', 271, 9, 26, 523689) Ramanbhais humour permeates his works.
('41', 271, 9, 27, 523728) He did not however look upon life as something of a jest.
('41', 271, 9, 28, 523786) He found the fulfilment of his life in devoting it to the performance of duty.
('41', 271, 9, 29, 523865) Ramanbhai would indeed help any good cause.
('41', 271, 9, 30, 523909) In matters of national welfare he always contributed his full share.
('41', 272, 0, 1, 523978) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 273
('41', 272, 1, 2, 524020) He never hesitated or spared himself in anything that he regarded as service.
('41', 272, 1, 3, 524098) In spite of his serious illness and in spite of severe differences in political matters he recognized the value of Vallabhbhais service to the municipality and he unfailingly co operated with him to the utmost whenever occasion arose.
('41', 272, 1, 4, 524333) There could hardly be a public institution in Ahmedabad which did not wish to have Ramanbhais name associated with it.
('41', 272, 1, 5, 524452) The loss of such a jewel of Gujarat will not be felt by his family members alone; the whole of Gujarat shares this grief of separation.
('41', 272, 1, 6, 524588) Nowadays, it has become customary to underestimate the quiet, unostentatious service of persons who do not take part in politics, especially in active politics.
('41', 272, 1, 7, 524749) In my humble opinion this is a mistake though time will certainly rectify it.
('41', 272, 1, 8, 524827) He who wipes the tears of even a single widow, who saves a single young girl from the immolation miscalled marriage, who renders selfless service to a single Antyaja, serves the country and society in a pure manner, and it is likely that, when the fight put up by a valiant political warrior is forgotten, this other service done in some obscure corner will still keep bearing fruit.
('41', 272, 1, 9, 525211) That service which is accompanied not by ovations but by Gods blessings is indeed true service.
('41', 272, 1, 10, 525307) Such was the service rendered by Ramanbhai.
('41', 272, 1, 11, 525351) He received his share of ovations too, but why describe what Ramanbhai never cared for!
('41', 272, 1, 12, 525439) He was a brave warrior.
('41', 272, 1, 13, 525463) Who has not seen him stick to his views as well as his own place amidst the whistling and shouting of young men?
('41', 272, 1, 14, 525576) Let us pray that we inherit his virtues.
('41', 272, 2, 15, 525617) LORD SINHA
('41', 272, 3, 16, 525628) India has suffered a great loss in the death of Lord Sinha.
('41', 272, 3, 17, 525688) He was a pillar of India.
('41', 272, 3, 18, 525714) He had reached the highest office on the strength of his intellect.
('41', 272, 3, 19, 525782) Although it is true that that office has little value in this age of non co operation, the abilities that were required in order to reach it have much value.
('41', 272, 3, 20, 525940) Lord Sinha did not go out of his way to seek office.
('41', 272, 3, 21, 525993) It could be said on the contrary that offices came seeking him.
('41', 272, 3, 22, 526057) However, I do not wish to discuss here the various offices that he held at different times.
('41', 272, 3, 23, 526149) The reader must have come to know of these from other newspapers.
('41', 272, 3, 24, 526215) I wish to give a short account of my acquaintance with him.
('41', 272, 3, 25, 526275) I saw him for the first time at the Congress in 1915. This was my second experience of the Congress.
('41', 272, 3, 26, 526376) At this session, I came to know only of his intellectual powers.
('41', 272, 3, 27, 526441) Everyone appreciated his erudite
('41', 273, 0, 1, 526474) 274 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 273, 1, 2, 526516) speech.
('41', 273, 1, 3, 526524) His criticism of the Empire carried weight.
('41', 273, 1, 4, 526568) Everyone on the Congress Working Committee admired the way in which he transacted business.
('41', 273, 1, 5, 526660) We cannot all emulate his intellectual powers.
('41', 273, 1, 6, 526707) There was however one quality of his, of which I came to know at a reception in his honour, which we could all imitate, and that is his humility.
('41', 273, 1, 7, 526853) I came to know more of this quality at the time of Desh bandhu Das Memorial Fund.
('41', 273, 1, 8, 526935) All of us felt that the association of his name with the raising of this Fund would indeed be welcome.
('41', 273, 1, 9, 527038) Persons belonging to all parties felt that, if his name was associated with it, it would facilitate the raising of the Fund and that this would make people from all parties readily associate themselves with it.
('41', 273, 1, 10, 527249) I was among those who approached him.
('41', 273, 1, 11, 527287) He was in indifferent health at that time; but he would meet people whenever necessary.
('41', 273, 1, 12, 527375) He willingly agreed to the inclusion of his name and also agreed to give all possible help.
('41', 273, 1, 13, 527467) On these occasions, I became well aware of his humility, his courtesy and his greatness and I felt that India would add to her prestige if all our elder statesmen possessed these qualities.
('41', 273, 1, 14, 527657) I noticed that he did not crave for respect but was always eager to show respect to others.
('41', 273, 1, 15, 527749) Those who do not crave for respect deserve it; privileges cling to those who try to shake them off.
('41', 273, 1, 16, 527849) Lord Sinha happened to be in this happy situation.
('41', 273, 1, 17, 527900) May all of us inherit that humility and that courtesy.

('41', 273, 2, 20, 528033) This hundi 1 should have been put out earlier.
('41', 273, 2, 21, 528080) But as the saying goes the affairs of the sick are managed in a sickly manner and its publication was delayed.
('41', 273, 2, 22, 528191) It is therefore expected that those who are prepared to accept it would send in their contributions, along with the interest, to Bhai Mulchand Parekh.
('41', 273, 2, 23, 528342) Not all Hindus like to serve the Antyajas.
('41', 273, 2, 24, 528385) Hence I hope that those who regard untouchability as a disease of the Hindu faith will remember that they have a twofold duty to help this cause.

('41', 274, 3, 4, 528788) DEAR FRIEND, I was delighted to receive your long letter.
('41', 274, 3, 5, 528846) I endorse every word of what you say about Mrs. Gandhi and the wretched incident I have related in the autobiographical chapters.
('41', 274, 3, 6, 528976) 1 Of course you have not imagined that I am in any way proud of recalling the brutality or that I am today capable of any such brutality.
('41', 274, 3, 7, 529114) But I thought that if people recognize me as a gentle peace loving man, they should also know that at one time I could be a positive beast even though at the same time I claimed to be a loving husband.
('41', 274, 3, 8, 529316) It was not without good cause that a friend once described me as a combination of sacred cow and ferocious tiger.
('41', 274, 3, 9, 529430) It would have been a pity if you had burnt your beautiful letter as at one time you thought you should.
('41', 274, 3, 10, 529534) You have certainly not appeared to me to be rude or ill mannered but most natural and on that account lovable.
('41', 274, 3, 11, 529645) I do indeed wish that I had come in closer contact with your dear brother, but I knew him enough to love him and to appreciate his sterling worth.

('41', 275, 2, 3, 530034) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI, March 12, 1928
('41', 275, 3, 4, 530079) MY DEAR FRIEND, I like the manner in which you are combating my views.
('41', 275, 3, 5, 530150) I discovered the difference between us even in Orissa.
('41', 275, 3, 6, 530205) For me, there is no difference between the individual and the social position.
('41', 275, 3, 7, 530284) At the same time there is ample room for the compromise of the nature suggested by you, for the simple reason that I ever compromise my own ideals even in individual conduct not because I wish to but because the compromise was inevitable.
('41', 275, 3, 8, 530523) And so in social and political matters I have never exacted complete fulfilment of the ideal in which I have believed.
('41', 275, 3, 9, 530642) But there are always times when one has to say thus far and no further, and, each time the dividing line has to be determined on merits.
('41', 275, 3, 10, 530779) Generally speaking where the sum total of a movement has been evil, I have held non co operation to be the only remedy and where the sum total has been for the good of humanity, I have held co operation on the basis of compromise to be the most desirable thing.
('41', 275, 3, 11, 531041) If I seem to be holding myself aloof from some of the political movements just now, it is because I believe their tendency to be not for the promotion of swaraj but rather its retarding.
('41', 275, 3, 12, 531228) It may be that I have erred in my judgment.
('41', 275, 3, 13, 531272) If so, it is but human and I have never claimed to be infallible.
('41', 275, 3, 14, 531338) You will see this point somewhat developed in a recent autobiographical chapter dealing with my participation in the late War.
('41', 275, 3, 15, 531465) 1 Tell me now if I have answered your question, even if I have not solved the puzzle.
('41', 275, 3, 16, 531551) Andrews is here and will be for a few days longer.
('41', 275, 3, 17, 531602) How nice it would be if you could come and pass a few days of quiet with me so that we could discuss the important problems you have been raising in your letters.
('41', 275, 3, 18, 531765) This is however not to say that you may not discuss them through correspondence.
('41', 275, 3, 19, 531846) Please do, so long as it is necessary.

('41', 276, 3, 4, 532117) MY DEAR PROFESSOR, With reference to a letter by the Secretary to the Association dated 1st March, I want to say that in spite of all the difficulties in our way we must aim at getting a complete list of the spinners who bring their yarn to the common bazaar.
('41', 276, 3, 5, 532377) I hold it to be absolutely necessary for the movement itself.
('41', 276, 3, 6, 532439) If we are to really serve these spinners, we must establish direct contact with them.
('41', 276, 3, 7, 532525) It may take a little time but our work is incomplete till we know our spinners and know them in their own homes and see how they work, where they get their cotton, how they pass their time otherwise and so on and so forth.
('41', 276, 3, 8, 532748) If we would consider this to be a necessary part of our work there will be no question of sparing or not sparing workers, just as there will be no question as to the keeping of our accounts or knowing the quality and the quantity of yarn we receive.
('41', 276, 3, 9, 532998) I have no time to say more to you.
('41', 276, 3, 10, 533033) I speak to you on other matters through Krishnadas.
('41', 276, 3, 11, 533085) I hope there is no trouble about the seat of operation now.

('41', 277, 7, 12, 534284) DEAR SIR,
('41', 277, 8, 13, 534294) RE: Ajmal Jamia Fund Your letter dated 10th inst.
('41', 277, 8, 14, 534344) I am sorry to say that you have not replied to my letter of the 3rd instant.
('41', 277, 8, 15, 534421) Mr. Zakir Husain, Jamia Millia, Delhi, has under instructions from Seth Jamnalalji been sending to us copies of lists sent to you of donations received by him for the above Fund and deposited by him in the Central Bank of India, Delhi.
('41', 277, 8, 16, 534657) We have published his first list on 8th March in Young India.
('41', 277, 8, 17, 534719) He has sent us another one for Rs. 1,492 13 0 which we are publishing in the forthcoming issue of Young India.
('41', 277, 8, 18, 534830) We have added to the list the names you have sent to us on 3rd as also on 10th instant.
('41', 277, 8, 19, 534918) We would request you to compare the lists up to now published in Young India with your account books and let us know if there are any discrepancies so that we may correct the same in the next issue.
('41', 277, 8, 20, 535117) You will please advise us also as to whether we could publish the lists that are being sent by Mr. Zakir Husain from time to time.
('41', 277, 8, 21, 535248) Or if not, would you kindly [send them so as to] reach us not later than Monday every week?
('41', 277, 8, 22, 535340) I wonder how you were able to get Rs. 1,559 0 0 as per the list
('41', 278, 0, 1, 535404) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 279
('41', 278, 1, 2, 535446) sent by you on 3rd March when you have taken Rs. 1,254 0 0, the amount previously acknowledged in Young India.
('41', 278, 2, 3, 535557) Yours sincerely,
('41', 278, 3, 4, 535574) From a microfilm: S.N. 14911
('41', 278, 4, 5, 535603) 317. WHAT CAN OUR MILLS DO?
('41', 278, 4, 6, 535631) Everybody is anxious that at this critical juncture in our history, we should be able to exhibit some real strength.
('41', 278, 4, 7, 535748) It is being more and more realized that such strength can be developed and shown only through boycott of foreign cloth as distinguished from British cloth.
('41', 278, 4, 8, 535904) In this boycott it is possible for our mills to play an important, indeed a decisive, part if they wish.
('41', 278, 4, 9, 536009) Some day or other they will have to choose between this alien Government and the people.
('41', 278, 4, 10, 536098) There is no doubt that to a large extent they are dependent for their existence upon the toleration if not the goodwill of the Government.
('41', 278, 4, 11, 536237) Thoreau told the truth when he said that possession of riches under an evil government was a sin and poverty was virtue.
('41', 278, 4, 12, 536358) The riches of the rich are always at the disposal of the government of the day whether it is good or bad.
('41', 278, 4, 13, 536464) But if the mills are dependent for their existence on the toleration or goodwill of the Government, they are no less so on the toleration or goodwill of the people.
('41', 278, 4, 14, 536629) They can afford to ignore the people only so long as the latter remain ignorant, supine or disunited.
('41', 278, 4, 15, 536731) But the past seven years have not been lived in vain by the nation.
('41', 278, 4, 16, 536799) The mass awakening that has taken place will never die.
('41', 278, 4, 17, 536855) No one can tell when and how the people will show their strength.
('41', 278, 4, 18, 536921) But the mills occupy a privileged position.
('41', 278, 4, 19, 536965) By showing a little courage, a little consideration for the true interests of the nation and by exercising a little self sacrifice they can serve both the Government and the people.
('41', 278, 4, 20, 537147) They can convert the government and advance the peoples cause.
('41', 278, 4, 21, 537210) This is now in my humble opinion they can do it: They can standardize their prices taking the lowest average of a number of top and lean years.
('41', 278, 4, 22, 537354) They can come to terms with the leaders organizing boycott as to the qunatity and quality of cloth required for the nation.
('41', 278, 4, 23, 537478) They can refrain from manufacturing those varieties that can be easily and immediately produced by khadi organizations, thus freeing
('41', 279, 0, 1, 537611) 280 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 279, 1, 2, 537653) their energy for manufacturing more of the varieties they can at the present moment more easily manufacture than the khadi orga nizations.
('41', 279, 1, 3, 537792) They can limit their profits to a minimum and let the surplus, if any, be devoted to the fulfilment of the boycott or, if that be unnecessary, to the improvement of the condition of the labourers.
('41', 279, 1, 4, 537989) This would mean all round honesty, perseverance, mutual trust, a voluntary and honourable triple alliance between labour, capital and the consumer.
('41', 279, 1, 5, 538137) It would mean capacity for organization on a vast scale.
('41', 279, 1, 6, 538194) And if we are to attain boycott of foreign cloth through non violence, we shall have some day or other to fulfil the tests just enumerated by me.
('41', 279, 1, 7, 538340) In my humble opinion we are eminently fitted for the task.
('41', 279, 1, 8, 538399) The organization required for the purpose is not unfamiliar to us.
('41', 279, 1, 9, 538466) The only question is, have we the will?
('41', 279, 1, 10, 538506) Have the mill owners enough visi on, enough love of the country?
('41', 279, 1, 11, 538571) If they have, they can take the lead.
('41', 279, 1, 12, 538609) Let me redeclare my own faith.
('41', 279, 1, 13, 538640) For boycott to be swiftly brought about a combination between khadi and truly indigenous mills is desirable, but not absolutely necessary.
('41', 279, 1, 14, 538779) I use the words truly indigenous, because we have bogus mills in India which are Indian only in the sense that they are located in the country but whose shareholders, whose management, whose spirit are mainly, when not wholly, foreign.
('41', 279, 1, 15, 539015) But if the indigenous mills cannot or will not lead or join national movement, I am convinced that khadi alone can achieve the boycott if the politically minded India has the will, the faith and the energy required for the purpose.
('41', 279, 1, 16, 539247) We have not enough horsepower expressed through steam engines, oil engines or electricity, but we have an inexhaustible reservoir of manpower lying idle and pleading to be used, and essentially qualified for the purpose.
('41', 279, 1, 17, 539468) Oh, for a faith that would see and use this supply of living power!

('41', 279, 2, 21, 539669) Shankarrao Dev is the founder president and guardian angel.
('41', 279, 2, 22, 539729) This Mandal has village reconstruction as its principal activity, and has become convinced that spinning must be the centre of every activity connected with reconstruction, if it is to prosper and respond to the deep poverty of the masses.
('41', 279, 2, 23, 539969) All its work is
('41', 280, 0, 1, 539985) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 281
('41', 280, 1, 2, 540027) as thorough as it can be made.
('41', 280, 1, 3, 540058) S. V. Thakkar has been training himself for some time before settling down in a village for reconstr uction service.
('41', 280, 1, 4, 540175) He has been travelling together with Sjt.
('41', 280, 1, 5, 540217) Balubhai Mehta in those centres where such activity is going on.
('41', 280, 1, 6, 540282) The brief report he has presented to the president of his Mandal is worth reading.
('41', 280, 1, 7, 540365) I therefore reproduce the main part of it for the guidence of those who do this work: 1

('41', 280, 3, 9, 540476) 319. NOTES
('41', 280, 4, 10, 540487) A.I.S.A. MEMBERSHIP The foregoing summaries 2 tell their own tale.
('41', 280, 4, 11, 540554) There is a drop from the figures of 1927 in all the three classes.
('41', 280, 4, 12, 540621) The reason is that there has been little or no canvassing for membership because the policy of the Association rightly has been not to incur any expenses over sacrificial spinning.
('41', 280, 4, 13, 540802) It loses all merit when it requires to be canvassed and stimulated through paid agency.
('41', 280, 4, 14, 540890) But the membership can be easily doubled if every member were to undertake to find one new member.
('41', 280, 4, 15, 540989) It is worthy of note that whilst the membership has decreased, there has been a marked increase in the production and sale of khadi as well as in the number of spinners who spin for hire.
('41', 280, 4, 16, 541177) For the information of juveniles, I reproduce below the resolution of the Council of the Association.
('41', 280, 4, 17, 541279) National schools can do a great deal for increasing the number of juvenile members:
('41', 280, 5, 18, 541363) Resolved that a B class of juvenile members of the Association be created, consisting of persons below 18 years of age who habitually wear khadi and contribute to the Association an annual subscription of 2,000 yards of self spun yarn well twisted and uniform.
('41', 280, 5, 19, 541624) INSTRUCTIVE FIGURES I have been always repeating at public meetings that 50,000 spinners were being served by the All India Spinners Association in 1,500 villages.
('41', 280, 5, 20, 541788) This statement was based on the figures compiled by the All India Spinners Association on the basis of yarn production and was made in 1927. Since then more than a year has passed.
('41', 280, 5, 21, 541969) An attempt was made to arrive at the total number from direct evidence,
('41', 280, 6, 22, 542041) 1 The report is not reproduced here.

('41', 281, 1, 2, 542142) i.e., by taking a census of spinners and incidentally of weavers and carders supported by the All India Spinners Association.
('41', 281, 1, 3, 542268) The table 1
('41', 281, 2, 4, 542280) appended to this note gives those figures.
('41', 281, 2, 5, 542323) It will be seen that all the provinces have not made their returns to have all the organizations in the provinces that have sent their figures been able to comply with the requirements of the All India Spinners Association.
('41', 281, 2, 6, 542547) The figures given below are therefore in every way an underestimate and yet they are a decided advance upon 50,000 spinners and 1,500 villages.
('41', 281, 2, 7, 542691) But this is merely a foretaste of the possibilities of a movement which awaits the tangible support of an enlightened public opinion.
('41', 281, 2, 8, 542825) There is an illimitable scope for production of khadi if demand can only be guaranteed.

('41', 281, 4, 11, 542953) The autobiographical chapter dealing with my participation in the late War continues to puzzle friends and critics.
('41', 281, 4, 12, 543069) Here is one more letter: 2
('41', 281, 5, 13, 543096) No doubt it was a mixed motive that prompted me to parti cipate in the War.
('41', 281, 5, 14, 543172) Two things I can recall.
('41', 281, 5, 15, 543197) Though as an indi vidual I was opposed to war, I had no status for offering effec tive non violent resistance.
('41', 281, 5, 16, 543308) Non violent resistance can only follow some real disinterested service, some heart expression of love.
('41', 281, 5, 17, 543411) For instance, I would have no status to resist a savage offering animal sacrifice until he could recognize in me his friend through some loving act of mine or other means.
('41', 281, 5, 18, 543583) I do not sit in judgment upon the world for its many misdeeds.
('41', 281, 5, 19, 543646) Being imperfect myself and needing toleration and charity, I tolerate the worlds imperfections till I find or create an opportunity for fruitful expostulation.
('41', 281, 5, 20, 543806) I felt that if by sufficient service I could attain the power and the confidence to resist the Empires wars and its warlike preparations, it would be a good thing for me who was seeking to enforce non violence in my own life to test the extent to which it was possible among the masses.
('41', 281, 6, 21, 544093) 1 Not reproduced here 2 Not reproduced here.
('41', 281, 6, 22, 544138) Referring to Chapters XXXVIII and XXXIX of Part IV of the Autobiography the correspondent had asked: What impelled you to participate in the War?
('41', 281, 6, 23, 544284) Was it right to join the War with the hope of gaining something?
('41', 281, 6, 24, 544349) I do not know how to reconcile this with the teaching of the Gita which says that we should never act with a view to the fruits of action.
('41', 282, 0, 1, 544488) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 283
('41', 282, 1, 2, 544530) The other motive was to qualify for swaraj through the good offices of the statesmen of the Empire.
('41', 282, 1, 3, 544630) I could not thus qualify myself except through serving the Empire in its life and death struggle.
('41', 282, 1, 4, 544728) It must be understood that I am writing of my mentality in 1914 when I was a believer in the Empire and its willing ability to help India in her battle for freedom.
('41', 282, 1, 5, 544893) Had I been the non violent rebel that I am today, I should certainly not have helped but through every effort open to non violence I should have attempted to defeat its purpose.
('41', 282, 1, 6, 545071) My opposition to and disbelief in war was as strong then as it is today.
('41', 282, 1, 7, 545144) But we have to recognize that there are many things in the world which we do although we may be against doing them.
('41', 282, 1, 8, 545260) I am as much opposed to taking the life of the lowest creature alive as I am to war.
('41', 282, 1, 9, 545345) But I continually take such life hoping some day to attain the ability to do without this fratricide.
('41', 282, 1, 10, 545447) To entitle me in spite of it to be called a votary of non violence, my attempt must be honest, strenuous and unceasing.
('41', 282, 1, 11, 545567) The conception of moksha, absolution from the need to have an embodied existence, is based upon the necessity of perfected men and women being completely non violent.
('41', 282, 1, 12, 545734) Possession of a body like every other possession necessitates some violence, be it ever so little.
('41', 282, 1, 13, 545833) The fact is that the path of duty is not always easy to discern amidst claims seeming to conflict one with the other.
('41', 282, 1, 14, 545951) Lastly, the verse referred to from the Gita has a double meaning.
('41', 282, 1, 15, 546017) One is that there should be no selfish purpose behind our actions.
('41', 282, 1, 16, 546084) That of gaining swaraj is not a selfish purpose.
('41', 282, 1, 17, 546133) Secon dly, to be detached from fruits of actions is not to be ignorant of them, or to disregard or disown them.
('41', 282, 1, 18, 546245) To be detached is never to abandon action because the contemplated result may not follow.
('41', 282, 1, 19, 546335) On the contrary, it is proof of immovable faith in the certainty of the contemplated result following in due course.

('41', 283, 3, 4, 546593) DEAR SRI NILRATAN SIRCAR, I have established in connection with the Ashram a little tannery where I am not making use of power driven machinery.
('41', 283, 3, 5, 546738) The idea is to have a model tannery to serve the village population.
('41', 283, 3, 6, 546807) Can you or anyone in your big undertaking help me with literature on tanning to be of use for the little enterprise commenced at the Ashram and give me any hints for my guidance?
('41', 283, 3, 7, 546986) May I ask you to share this letter with Mr. Das of the Research Tannery if you have not proposed it yourself and procure for me similar assistance from him?
('41', 283, 3, 8, 547143) We are all at the Ashram without any knowledge of conducting tanneries, and what I want to do is to learn from the beginning, i.e., how to skin dead cattle and treat hide from the very commencement as it comes out of the carcass.
('41', 283, 4, 9, 547373) Yours sincerely,

('41', 283, 8, 13, 547494) DEAR FRIEND, After a great deal of thought and bother I have established at the Ashram a little bit of a tannery without any power driven machi nery and without skilled assistance save that of a man who has received a rough and tumble experience of tanning in America and who is a crank like myself.
('41', 283, 8, 14, 547794) Though I did not succeed in sharing your troubles and taking the load off your shoulders in connection with your own great national enterprise, your inspi ration is partly responsible for the establishment of this little tannery at the Ashram.
('41', 283, 8, 15, 548038) Can you please help me with a list of literature on the subject, a handbook on tanning and the like?
('41', 283, 8, 16, 548139) If you think that there is nothing like it in English, will you

('41', 284, 1, 2, 548245) out of your own wide and varied experience write out something that may be of use for propaganda, just a few hints?
('41', 284, 1, 3, 548361) What is happening at the Tannery?
('41', 284, 1, 4, 548395) Who is in charge?
('41', 284, 1, 5, 548413) I may add that my idea is to make the Ashram Tannery a model for villages so that the villagers may be able to treat their own dead cattle and make use of the hide themselves.
('41', 284, 1, 6, 548589) I have asked many people without success as to how I can skin dead cattle.
('41', 284, 1, 7, 548664) Everybody knowing anything of tanning has something to say about hides after they are received from the village tanner; but nobody has yet told me if I take charge of a dead animal I can skin the carcass economically and hygienically and make use of other contents such as bones, intestine, etc., for purposes of manure.
('41', 284, 2, 8, 548985) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 286, 14, 20, 551588) It surprises me however to find that you do not see any distinction between a private person committing a private wrong and a public person or a corporation committing a public wrong.

('41', 286, 14, 22, 551837) That is a matter of social reform and therefore of individuals living correct lives and [not] letting them, i.e., lives, afflict and inflict their surroundings.

('41', 287, 2, 3, 552203) SABARMATI, March 17, 1928
('41', 287, 3, 4, 552229) DEAR FRIEND, I have now heard from Mr. Jayakar and I see from it that Sir Purushottamdas is no longer the president.
('41', 287, 3, 5, 552346) This, however, is the opinion he forwards to me :
('41', 287, 4, 6, 552396) He is however of opinion that the scheme is a useful one.
('41', 287, 4, 7, 552454) He suggests one caution to you that any help that you may be inclined to give, if it is to take the form of a collection of funds, should be conditioned that its control in the way of investment or disbursement should be in the hands of a few men of your own choice whose veracity and judgment could be implicitly trusted.
('41', 287, 4, 8, 552777) He assures that the scheme has a strong potentiality of being useful to the community, and deserves your support.
('41', 287, 4, 9, 552891) The funds at present in the hands of the office bearers are only a few hundred rupees, and unless they are supplemented it well be difficult for the institution to commence its work.
('41', 287, 4, 10, 553074) It therefore resolves itself into what I have suggested all along the line that there should be a proper trust deed.
('41', 287, 4, 11, 553191) I can now only suggest that you should see Seth Jamnalalji when he comes to Bombay which he will do in two or three days.
('41', 287, 4, 12, 553313) I am giving him all the papers and if he is satisfied about the trust, I shall be in a position to do something.

('41', 288, 7, 12, 554115) But what can we do, since we are non co operators?
('41', 288, 7, 13, 554166) I am quite all right.

('41', 288, 9, 16, 554223) 331. THE WEAPON OF BOYCOTT It has been reported that the satyagrahis of Bardoli are getting ready to use the weapon of boycott against those who agree to pay the revenue to the Government.
('41', 288, 9, 17, 554412) This weapon is a powerful one and the satyagrahi can use it only within limits.
('41', 288, 9, 18, 554492) Boycott can be violent as well as non violent.
('41', 288, 9, 19, 554539) It is only the latter kind that a satyagrahi may use.
('41', 288, 9, 20, 554593) At the moment I will only give examples of the two forms of boycott.
('41', 288, 9, 21, 554662) Non violent boycott may mean not accepting any service.
('41', 288, 9, 22, 554718) Refusal to serve may involve violence.
('41', 288, 9, 23, 554757) Non violent boycott may include a refusal to dine at the house of the person boycotted, refusal to attend marriages and such other functions at his place, doing no business with him and, taking no help from him.
('41', 288, 9, 24, 554969) On the other hand, refusing to nurse the boycotted person if he is sick, Lot allowing doctors to visit him, refusing to help in performing the last rites if he happens to die, refusing to allow him to make use of wells, temples, etc., all this is violent boycott.

('41', 289, 1, 2, 555300) reflection will reveal that non violent boycott can be continued for a long period and no external force can prove effectual in terminating it, whereas violent boycott cannot continue for long and external force can be used in a large measure to put an end to it.
('41', 289, 1, 3, 555564) Ultimately violent boycott only does disservice to a movement.
('41', 289, 1, 4, 555627) Many such instances can be quoted form the era of non co operation.
('41', 289, 1, 5, 555695) However, on this occasion, the distinction that I have pointed out should be enough for the satyagrahis and the workers of Bardoli.

('41', 290, 3, 5, 556593) You certainly have my blessings for your son.
('41', 290, 3, 6, 556639) I see no reason why you should feel nervous and run to Europe.

('41', 290, 3, 8, 556729) If some good doctor there is prepared to take the risk, I see no harm in getting the operation performed locally.
('41', 290, 3, 9, 556843) Have you consulted junior Deshmukh?

('41', 290, 3, 16, 557134) I only wish to explain to you that we must do nothing in haste and, realizing that this body is perishable, should not be excessively attached to it.

('41', 291, 3, 4, 557638) MY DEAR C. R., I have your letter.
('41', 291, 3, 5, 557673) You are out of court about your dietetics for your hopeless protest, namely, your spinning yarns about almonds and poor groundnuts, the food of the Himalayan race.
('41', 291, 3, 6, 557837) Take notice that the experiment is only suspended to enable me to return to it, unhampered by the weight of so called medical opinion.
('41', 291, 3, 7, 557972) I lived on raw groundnuts for at least 6 years without coming to grief of the sort referred to by you.
('41', 291, 3, 8, 558075) But of this later.
('41', 291, 3, 9, 558094) What about Europe?
('41', 291, 3, 10, 558113) My anxiety is to meet Rolland.
('41', 291, 3, 11, 558144) He appears to be the wisest man of Europe.
('41', 291, 3, 12, 558187) He takes an unusual interest in me and feels grieved if he thinks that in any single thing my opinion is wrong.
('41', 291, 3, 13, 558299) It seems to me that it would be a tragedy if we do not meet.
('41', 291, 3, 14, 558360) This is the cause that moves me above all else.
('41', 291, 3, 15, 558408) The rest is thrown in.
('41', 291, 3, 16, 558431) I do not know what Andrews has written to you.
('41', 291, 3, 17, 558478) But your opinion will have with me as much weight as Andrewss.
('41', 291, 3, 18, 558541) Therefore say without fear what you will have me do.
('41', 291, 3, 19, 558594) Many are grieved that I did not die on the 17th.
('41', 291, 3, 20, 558643) Perhaps I am one among them.
('41', 291, 3, 21, 558672) Perhaps I did die a kind of death.

('41', 292, 8, 16, 559562) I see no harm in Flood Relief Fund supporting you.
('41', 292, 8, 17, 559613) I am in correspondence with Thakkar Bapa about it and if it can be done without in any shape or form compromising your present posi tion, it should be done.
('41', 292, 8, 18, 559770) Whether you receive the money through me or the Flood Relief Committee, it would be from a public fund.
('41', 292, 8, 19, 559874) We must get rid of there being shame in honorary services being paid in the sense in which we use the word honorary.
('41', 292, 8, 20, 559991) The labourer is wor thy of his hire, and, all service is honorary when the servant takes no more than his hire.

('41', 293, 6, 10, 560829) MY DEAR SURESH BABU, I have seen the letter from the Secretary regarding the number of spinners served by you.
('41', 293, 6, 11, 560940) Do you not see that it is as essential for you to reach your spinners as it is for you to keep your books in a thoroughly good order?
('41', 293, 6, 12, 561074) If you do not take this precaution, you will find that the organization will one day collapse like a house of cards.
('41', 293, 6, 13, 561191) It does not matter whose yarn in the particular week day you have received but it does matter that you send some reliable person to the people who are actually spinning and find out their condition and talk to them.
('41', 293, 6, 14, 561407) Surely, it is neither an impossible task nor a very elaborate one.
('41', 293, 6, 15, 561474) When the spinners who come to the middle men to sell their yarn return home you have simply to follow them to their homes and, if they avoid you once, they wont avoid you always.
('41', 293, 6, 16, 561653) They will give you their confidence immediately they cease to distrust you.
('41', 293, 6, 17, 561729) You must have some middle men at least who are fairly honest and who will not mind taking your messenger to the very homes from which they receive their yarn.
('41', 293, 6, 18, 561888) And if this very simple thing is beyond your capacity, you are manifestly at the mercy of the middle men to whom it is open any day to stop their custom or to impose conditions which will be either impossible of acceptance or hurtful to your self respect.
('41', 293, 6, 19, 562144) I wish therefore that you will realize the importance of the suggestion which Mr. Banker has been making from time to time at my instance.

('41', 295, 6, 11, 563937) ROY, I have your letter for which I thank you.
('41', 295, 6, 12, 563984) The news in the Press about Dr. Ansaris visit was wholly libellous.
('41', 295, 6, 13, 564052) It upset so many friends and I had to answer cables even from Johannesburg and Siam.
('41', 295, 6, 14, 564137) You have now I suppose seen the correction that Dr. Ansaris visit had nothing to do with my health.
('41', 295, 6, 15, 564237) If it had, you as one of the keepers of my body would also have certainly known something about it directly from the Ashram.
('41', 295, 6, 16, 564362) Dr. Ansari came with Jamnalalji and Dr. Zakir Husain purely in connection with the National Muslim University and as he came he brought the instrument of torture and was bound to examine me.

('41', 296, 5, 13, 565826) I would willingly subscribe to it on the general grounds that the late Hakim Ajmal Khan had devoted his life to the relief of the sick and that a memorial of the kind proposed seemed to me well fitted to perpetuate his memory.

('41', 297, 2, 6, 566745) The telegram about my health was wholly libellous this time because it was absolutely without any foundation.
('41', 297, 2, 7, 566855) So far as I know, I have never been in better health.
('41', 297, 2, 8, 566909) Dr. Ansari and Jamnalalji came to discuss the Ajmal Khan Memorial in connection with the National Muslim University and nothing else.

('41', 297, 7, 13, 567153) RADHIKA, I got your beautiful postcards.
('41', 297, 7, 14, 567194) Remember all that I have told you.
('41', 297, 7, 15, 567229) Take great care of your health, and love everyone.
('41', 297, 7, 16, 567280) Rukhi is improving, but there is bleeding whenever she tries to walk.
('41', 297, 7, 17, 567350) The doctor has examined her.
('41', 297, 7, 18, 567379) You need not worry about anything on the side.
('41', 297, 7, 19, 567426) Tell Durga also to write, and see that she does.

('41', 298, 1, 2, 567668) 347. INTERVIEW TO ALICE SCHALEK
('41', 298, 2, 3, 567700) March 20, 1928
('41', 298, 3, 4, 567715) Mahatma Gandhi received Miss Alice Schalek on the 20th of March in the Ashram at 4 oclock.
('41', 298, 3, 5, 567806) When she entered, he said : Please excuse me for my remaining on my seat, I cannot stand up.
('41', 298, 4, 6, 567899) MISS S.: May I ask some questions?
('41', 298, 5, 7, 567934) GANDHIJI: Of course, please do.
('41', 298, 6, 8, 567966) Q. Does your influence grow of decline?
('41', 298, 6, 9, 568006) A. A question difficult to answer, but I fancy it is growing, so far as the masses are concerned.
('41', 298, 7, 10, 568104) Q. Is it true that in your meaning the British have done no good to India?
('41', 298, 7, 11, 568179) And you even regard the railways harmful?
('41', 298, 8, 12, 568221) A. Partly true.
('41', 298, 8, 13, 568237) The total effect of the British rule in India has been nothing but evil.
('41', 298, 8, 14, 568310) The railways have done more harm than good.
('41', 298, 9, 15, 568354) Q. Have they not been useful in famines?
('41', 298, 10, 16, 568395) A. They may serve a temporary useful purpose.
('41', 298, 10, 17, 568441) But they have generally served to carry away from the villager what he needs for himself.
('41', 298, 11, 18, 568531) Q. But he gets money for it?
('41', 298, 12, 19, 568560) A. But he cannot eat the money.
('41', 298, 12, 20, 568592) If you were in the desert of Sahara and you had only as much water as you needed for keeping you alive, would you sell it for any amount of gold?
('41', 298, 13, 21, 568738) Q. But are not they selling only what is superfluous?
('41', 298, 14, 22, 568792) A. They sell their birthright when they sell their raw produce.
('41', 298, 14, 23, 568856) They do so because they know no better.
('41', 298, 14, 24, 568896) If you have my welfare at heart, would you advise me to sell raw hide and get from you manufactured shoes, or to sell my cotton and purchase manufactured cloth?
('41', 298, 14, 25, 569057) I am asking my countrymen to store their cotton and spin it into yarn and make their own cloth.
('41', 298, 15, 26, 569153) Q. They say that where there are railways there is no starvation.
('41', 298, 15, 27, 569219) In case of famine, they take food quickly from a place where it is in abundance to a place where it is needed.
('41', 298, 16, 28, 569330) A. Those who laid out the railways did not think of the welfare
('41', 299, 0, 1, 569394) 300 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 299, 1, 2, 569436) of the people.
('41', 299, 1, 3, 569451) They thought of the interest of the distant shareholders or principals.
('41', 299, 1, 4, 569523) The advantage, in case of a famine, is small when we think of the counterbalancing disadvantages.
('41', 299, 1, 5, 569621) It is like a robber robbing me of my all and then offering me back a trifle.
('41', 299, 2, 6, 569698) Q. Would India have been better if railways had not been here?
('41', 299, 3, 7, 569761) A. I have no doubt, other conditions being satisfied.
('41', 299, 4, 8, 569815) Q. How can the railways be made useful?
('41', 299, 5, 9, 569855) A. The policy should be so conceived as to be consistent with the real interests of the people, that is to say, they should enable people to remain self supporting as they were before the railways came.
('41', 299, 5, 10, 570058) Today they are being pauperized both in mind and body.
('41', 299, 5, 11, 570113) They knew how to make the best use of their raw material.
('41', 299, 5, 12, 570171) They used to turn their cotton into cloth, their hide into shoes, their corn into bread.
('41', 299, 5, 13, 570260) Today the process is being reversed.
('41', 299, 5, 14, 570297) I cannot consider anything more [harmful] than that millions should have to export their raw material which they can manufacture at home, and import finished products.
('41', 299, 5, 15, 570465) The railways can usefully serve to transmit the finished products manufactured by the villagers from one part of the country to another.
('41', 299, 6, 16, 570602) Q. There should be a large movement to teach the people to do all these things?
('41', 299, 7, 17, 570682) A. There was ample interprovincial trade before.
('41', 299, 8, 18, 570731) Q. Is not the foreign method cheaper?
('41', 299, 9, 19, 570769) Even if it was, our own product would be cheaper at a higher cost.
('41', 299, 9, 20, 570836) For instance when we in the Ashram first began to grow our vegetables they cost us more than the market vegetables.
('41', 299, 9, 21, 570952) But now we grow them better and cheaper than elsewhere and our own inmates get work also.
('41', 299, 10, 22, 571042) Q. May I speak frankly?
('41', 299, 10, 23, 571066) I was told in Bengal that khaddar is more expensive and coarser than British cloth and that women who pledge themselves to wear khaddar have their underwear made of foreign cloth.
('41', 299, 11, 24, 571246) A. If khaddar is coarser, patriotism demands that measure of sacrifice.
('41', 299, 11, 25, 571318) There is no doubt that we have made a considerable advance on what we used to produce some years ago and we have been able to effect considerable reduction in prices.
('41', 299, 11, 26, 571485) As for the ladies you were told about, I can only say that it was not proper for them to use any foreign cloth if they were pledged to wear khadi.
('41', 300, 0, 1, 571632) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 301
('41', 300, 1, 2, 571674) Q. What are your aims and ideals?
('41', 300, 2, 3, 571708) A. I want perfect freedom for my country through non violent and truthful means.
('41', 300, 3, 4, 571789) Q. Do you think you can reach so far through non violence?
('41', 300, 4, 5, 571848) A. My own conviction is that we shall obtain it only through non violence and not otherwise.
('41', 300, 4, 6, 571941) I think it more possible of attainment through non violent than through violent means.
('41', 300, 5, 7, 572028) Q. What do you mean by freedom?
('41', 300, 6, 8, 572060) A. I want the freedom to make mistakes, and freedom to unmake them, and freedom to grow to my full height and freedom to stumble also.
('41', 300, 6, 9, 572195) I do not want crutches.
('41', 300, 7, 10, 572219) Q. Dont you think the British have been very helpful to India?
('41', 300, 8, 11, 572282) A. They have been most harmful in every essential particular.
('41', 300, 8, 12, 572344) By they I mean the British Government.
('41', 300, 9, 13, 572383) Q. And why?
('41', 300, 9, 14, 572395) A. Because they have sapped the economic, mental and moral growth of the people.
('41', 300, 10, 15, 572476) Q. Dont you think they have helped in Indias economic growth?
('41', 300, 11, 16, 572538) A. According to the reports of Government officials them selves, India is poorer today than it was fifty years ago.
('41', 300, 11, 17, 572654) A few individuals may have become rich, but generally poverty is deepening.
('41', 300, 11, 18, 572730) There has been a little transfer of wealth, but no general prosperity of the country.
('41', 300, 12, 19, 572816) Q. Government say there were never before so many purchasers.
('41', 300, 13, 20, 572878) A. It is wrong if they mean that people could not buy then and that they can buy now.
('41', 300, 13, 21, 572964) It is true in the sense that whereas people did not buy many things in those days, they do so today, and there are more goods to buy.
('41', 300, 14, 22, 573098) Q. But what is the sense of boycotting British goods?
('41', 300, 14, 23, 573152) England does not give preference to her own goods.
('41', 300, 14, 24, 573203) There is free competition for all the nations of the world.
('41', 300, 15, 25, 573263) It is wrong.
('41', 300, 15, 26, 573276) It only appears as though there was free competition.
('41', 300, 15, 27, 573330) England does give preference to her goods in a variety of insidious ways.
('41', 300, 15, 28, 573404) There is apparent freedom, but no true freedom.
('41', 300, 15, 29, 573452) But even if the British were impartial in favouring foreigners, I would have my quarrel with them.
('41', 300, 15, 30, 573551) I want preference for Indian interests.
('41', 301, 0, 1, 573591) 302 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 301, 1, 2, 573633) Q. How?
('41', 301, 2, 3, 573641) A. By prohibiting import of all foreign cloth and by levying a heavy tax on all imports that can be manufactured in the country.
('41', 301, 3, 4, 573770) Q. Buy your cost of manufacture will be much higher.
('41', 301, 4, 5, 573823) A. High and low prices are no necessary indication of the prosperity or depression of a country.
('41', 301, 4, 6, 573920) It is infinitely better that I grow my vegetable even if the cost is a trifle higher than that I should depend for them on someone else.
('41', 301, 4, 7, 574057) Then I shall try to reduce the cost by judicious and skilful management.
('41', 301, 4, 8, 574130) The gain in skill, comfort and the knowledge that we grow our vegetables is much greater than the little gain we might have in getting vegetables cheap in Ahmedabad.
('41', 301, 4, 9, 574296) Even in the matter [of] producing cloth we could do it in no time and quite cheap if we were left to our own resources.
('41', 301, 5, 10, 574416) Q. There is no country in the world which is free from foreign competition.
('41', 301, 6, 11, 574492) A. Pardon me.
('41', 301, 6, 12, 574506) Germany was one.
('41', 301, 6, 13, 574523) Germany erected a prohi bitive tariff wall on all foreign sugar and then successfully produced its best sugar.
('41', 301, 6, 14, 574634) Every nation protects its infant industry by bounties and tariffs.
('41', 301, 7, 15, 574701) Q. Do you mean to say that all foreign imports must be stopped and that India must use only indigenous goods?
('41', 301, 8, 16, 574811) A. We may have from foreign countries all the things we cannot produce, e.g., we may have iodine from Britain or Germany, we may have pearls from Arabia, diamonds from Johannesburg, lever watches from England and good readable books from England, America and all countries in the world.
('41', 301, 8, 17, 575098) Indeed I should have need[les] and pinsdangerous weapons both!from foreign coun tries, and quite a number of other things I can mention.
('41', 301, 8, 18, 575235) And we may profitably export to other countries whatever they need, but we should never impose anything on anybody.
('41', 301, 8, 19, 575351) For instance I may grow opium, but would not think of imposing it on China or America.
('41', 301, 9, 20, 575438) Q. But if you make your own things, would you not have to face the labour question?
('41', 301, 10, 21, 575522) A. Why?
('41', 301, 10, 22, 575530) If it arises, it will solve itself.
('41', 301, 11, 23, 575566) Q. Would you do it all on capitalistic basis or communistic basis?
('41', 301, 12, 24, 575633) A. On a nationalistic basis, in the interests of the people.
('41', 301, 13, 25, 575694) Q. But who will finance the industries?
('41', 301, 14, 26, 575734) Our finance consists in our own men and women, and

('41', 302, 1, 2, 575827) we have got them in their millions.
('41', 302, 2, 3, 575863) Q. Should your industry be run by the State or by the country?
('41', 302, 3, 4, 575926) A. It does not matter how it is run, provided it is run in the interests of the millions, not of a class.
('41', 302, 3, 5, 576032) That principle assured, I should not mind who nominally runs it.

('41', 303, 2, 6, 577533) 1 I would just like to say that whilst I am a passionate devotee of simplicity in life, I have also discovered that it is worthless unless the echo of simplicity comes from within.
('41', 303, 2, 7, 577714) The modern organized artificiality of so called civilized life cannot have any accord with true simplicity of heart.
('41', 303, 2, 8, 577831) Where the two do not correspond, there is always either gross self deception or hypocrisy.

('41', 304, 7, 11, 579094) CHARKHA A PROVED WANT Akbarpur in U.P. is a little place where Professor Kripalanis khadi band worked for seven years.
('41', 304, 7, 12, 579213) For reason into which I need not go, this band had to withdraw from Akbarpur.
('41', 304, 7, 13, 579291) Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru describes the touching scenes that followed the withdrawal and how the centre had somehow to be kept up.
('41', 304, 7, 14, 579420) The following from his letter to the All India Spinners Association will be read with interest:
('41', 304, 8, 15, 579516) I have told you already that the Gandhi Ashram has left Akbarpur.
('41', 304, 8, 16, 579582) We have taken charge temporarily because we felt that pending your decision we ought to carry on.
('41', 304, 8, 17, 579680) If we had not taken charge there would have been a break and it would have been more difficult to start afresh.
('41', 304, 8, 18, 579792) Besides, on sentimental grounds also it was a little difficult to abandon the place.
('41', 304, 8, 19, 579877) It has been a well known centre for so many years and a large number of weavers and others are intimately connected with it.
('41', 304, 8, 20, 580002) To leave it suddenly would have had a bad effect on the whole neighbourhood and upset the economy of a great number of poor households who were dependent on it.
('41', 304, 8, 21, 580163) Indeed, we were told that some touching incidents were witnessed when the Gandhi Ashram announced that they were closing up.
('41', 304, 8, 22, 580288) Many old women spinners who used to sell their yarn at a distant centre, finding this centre closed, trudged up many miles to headquarters and wept when they found that their yarn was not to be bought.
('41', 304, 8, 23, 580490) Many weavers with their wives and families came up to the Akbarpur office and said they would perform satyagraha.
('41', 304, 8, 24, 580604) For seven years they had been working for the Ashram and now they were being left in the lurch.
('41', 304, 8, 25, 580700) You will realize how difficult it was
('41', 305, 0, 1, 580738) 306 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 305, 1, 2, 580780) for us to refuse to take charge under these circumstances.
('41', 305, 1, 3, 580839) But of course, sentimental considerations cannot decide the question.
('41', 305, 1, 4, 580909) Akbarpur possesses some marked advantages and at the same time a very great disadvantage.
('41', 305, 1, 5, 580999) As a weaving centre it is famous and even now some of the finest weaving in India is done at Tanda in the neighbourhood.
('41', 305, 1, 6, 581120) Unhappily this fine weavingcalled jamdani workis done with foreign yarn.
('41', 305, 1, 7, 581193) On the other hand, there is very little spinning done near Akbarpur if the centre is to be worked it will be necessary to bring yarn from elsewhere.
('41', 305, 1, 8, 581342) The Gandhi Ashram, I believe, used to get their yarn chiefly from across the border in Bihar, also from Muzaffarnagar.
('41', 305, 1, 9, 581461) For us it will be easier to get it from the Northern Districts of the U.P*Moradabad, Bijnor, etc.
('41', 305, 1, 10, 581559) The cost of sending the yarn is not great.
('41', 305, 1, 11, 581602) If khadi became as current as ghee or grain, there could never have been a thought of withdrawing from any centre.
('41', 305, 1, 12, 581717) If we had funds and workers we would have representatives not only in 1,600 villages but in 7,00,000 villages.
('41', 305, 1, 13, 581828) This is no impracticable ambition, when we remember the fact that there are at least two representatives of the alien Government in each of these villages.
('41', 305, 1, 14, 581984) If anyone before the British advent had suggested any such thing, he would have been laughed out of court.
('41', 305, 1, 15, 582091) But reflection should show that the restoration of the wheel in every one of the villages is not half as laughable as the hope of imperial Britain being represented in the republican villages of India would have been in the 17th century.
('41', 305, 1, 16, 582329) What the women near Akbarpur are reported to have said demonstrates what a felt want the charkha fills or can fill in every village of this ancient land.
('41', 305, 1, 17, 582483) It is no credit to our patriotism that the able weavers of Akbarpur have to fall back upon foreign yarn for their far famed jamdani which it was their pride nearly half a century ago to weave out of yarn spun by the sacred hands of their own sisters living next door to them.
('41', 305, 1, 18, 582759) It wont be long before the spinners in our villages are able to spin as fine and as strong yarn as any foreign yarn now infesting our market.
('41', 305, 2, 19, 582901) CAN IT BE TRUE?
('41', 305, 3, 20, 582917) The president, Arya Samaj, New Delhi, writes: 1
('41', 305, 4, 21, 582965) The Baghat State is situated in the Simla Hills and its ruler is an enlightened Hindu chief.
('41', 305, 4, 22, 583058) The population of the State is about ten thousand and mainly consists of Rajputs, Kanets and Brahmins.
('41', 305, 4, 23, 583161) The other tribes are Kolis, Chamars, etc., who are regarded as menials.
('41', 305, 4, 24, 583233) Although the Kolis chiefly

('41', 306, 1, 2, 583339) live on agriculture yet the social disabilities to which they are subject are numerous.
('41', 306, 1, 3, 583427) Moved by the inhuman treatment which these people suffer at the hands of their Hindu brethren, the Arya Samaj, Simla, brought them into their fold with a view to raise their status in life and invested them with the sacred thread, inasmuch as by occupation they are Vaisyas.
('41', 306, 1, 4, 583702) This seems to have given umbrage to the caste Hindus who challenged the right of their being invested with the sacred thread.
('41', 306, 1, 5, 583828) A summary trial consequently held on the 6th January 1928 by the Chief of the State himself and on the subsequent day on the plea of antiquity and customs, the poor kolis who were ten in number were sentenced to undergo six months imprisonment in addition to a fine of Rs. 200 each.
('41', 306, 1, 6, 584111) No opportunity was given to these unfortunate persons to defend themselves, nor was permission given to the Pandit of the Arya Samaj who happened to be present on the occasion to explain the point of view of the Arya Samaj in this matter.
('41', 306, 1, 7, 584350) It is now reported that they are being coerced in the jail to take off their sacred thread.
('41', 306, 1, 8, 584442) The information contained in the foregoing seems to me to be unbelievable.
('41', 306, 1, 9, 584517) The Kolis can in no way be considered to be untouchables or to be of the suppressed or the depressed classes.
('41', 306, 1, 10, 584627) If they are their own farmers, according to the definition of the different varnas, they are born Vaisyas and have every right to wear the sacred thread.
('41', 306, 1, 11, 584781) But assuming that they have no right in religion, I was totally unprepared for the news that the wearing of the sacred thread would be considered a crime punishable in law in any State.
('41', 306, 1, 12, 584967) Equally unthinkable it is that the unfortunate men who thought that they had passed through some desirable or meritorious religious ceremony were denied even the right of defending themselves and producing their witnesses.
('41', 306, 1, 13, 585190) And, if the statements about the punishment and farcical trial are true, I should not at all wonder if the sacred thread had been forcibly taken off their persons.
('41', 306, 1, 14, 585354) I would invite the president of the Arya Samaj to send further details, if any, in corroboration of the charges brought by him against the Baghat State and I would invite the State authorities if they wish to send me their version of the incident which I shall gladly publish.

('41', 307, 2, 3, 585737) A friend intimately connected with mills and desirous of having our mills contributing their full quota to the foreign cloth boycott movement asks :
('41', 307, 3, 4, 585886) 1. On what basis do you want prices standardized?
('41', 307, 3, 5, 585936) For remember all mills are not alike.
('41', 307, 3, 6, 585974) Some are bad, some are good; some use more sizing than others, some have more reserve than others; Bombay mills make less profits than upcountry ones.
('41', 307, 3, 7, 586125) These difference are illustrative of many others that might be stated.
('41', 307, 3, 8, 586196) The one general answer that may be given is where theres a will theres a way.
('41', 307, 3, 9, 586274) The mills will contribute their quota only when they get rid of inertia, think furiously, and that too in terms of the nation, not merely the pockets of share holders, directors or agents.
('41', 307, 3, 10, 586463) But by way of making my position in this matter clearer I may say that all the mills who will join the boycott movement will have to pool all the differences and arrive at a standard price which would at least mean a large slice off from the present profits of at least some mills.
('41', 307, 3, 11, 586745) If their patriotism is sound and progressive the flourishing ones will cover the losing ones, avoidable differences will be avoided.
('41', 307, 3, 12, 586878) In the scheme I have in view the mills need never lose in the aggregate and they must not profit at the expense of the buyer.
('41', 307, 4, 13, 587004) 2. Only some mills will undertake not to manufacture khadi.
('41', 307, 4, 14, 587064) But what about those that only spin low counts?
('41', 307, 4, 15, 587112) What is your test of khadi?
('41', 307, 4, 16, 587140) This is a matter of common honesty and arrangement between khadi organizations and mills.
('41', 307, 4, 17, 587230) At present I am sorry to have to say that even some good mills are not ashamed to label their cloth khadi simply in order to take an illegitimate advantage of the growing khadi atmosphere in the mofussil.
('41', 307, 4, 18, 587435) If a workable arrangement is come to, I expect that there will be a line of demarcation for the time being between the cloth to be manufactured by khadi centres and mills.
('41', 307, 4, 19, 587607) The manufacture of cloth will be controlled as it often is in times of war.
('41', 307, 4, 20, 587683) What in a war based on violence we do by compulsion, in this war based on non violence we shall do by choice.
('41', 307, 4, 21, 587793) Our ability voluntarily, i.e., merely under pressure of public opinion, to arrange boycotts, etc., will be the outward but indispensable test of our non violence if we have any in us.
('41', 307, 5, 22, 587977) 3. How will profits be regulated?
('41', 307, 5, 23, 588011) You know as well as I do that prices of cotton fluctuate with irritating irregularity.
('41', 308, 0, 1, 588098) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 309
('41', 308, 1, 2, 588140) This assumes our inability to control the cotton market.
('41', 308, 1, 3, 588197) Surely if the largest manufacturers of the country combine in the patriotic effort, they will control the cotton market.
('41', 308, 1, 4, 588318) America rules our cotton prices because we stupidly, thoughtlessly, and selfishly send out our cotton.
('41', 308, 1, 5, 588421) But boycott means that we shall control the movement of cotton, as we shall control many other things, if we are to achieve complete boycott, as we must if we have developed the true national spirit and have confidence in ourselves and the nation.
('41', 308, 2, 6, 588669) 4. If you lay much stress upon honesty, perseverance, mutual trust, etc., you are doomed.
('41', 308, 2, 7, 588759) As I have no bayonet at my command and would not have it even if I could command it, I must press for the qualities which the friend fears are at a discount.
('41', 308, 2, 8, 588917) I do not share his fearwhat is more I have patience enough to wait for the development of those qualities if they are not available in sufficient measure today.
('41', 308, 2, 9, 589078) For this nation will never come to her own unless we exhibit them as a nation.
('41', 308, 2, 10, 589157) I know too that we shall take much longer to discipline ourselves for violence, fraud and the like than we shall for truth and non violence and all that they imply.
('41', 308, 2, 11, 589322) The friend then draws my attention to the following omissions in my previous article : 1
('41', 308, 3, 12, 589411) (a) The mills that join the scheme may not use foreign yarn or foreign artificial silk as many now do.
('41', 308, 3, 13, 589514) (b) They may not insure with foreign companies.
('41', 308, 3, 14, 589562) (c) They may not import foreign cloth and lable it swadeshi.
('41', 308, 3, 15, 589623) I had assumed that (a) and (c) were a foregone conclusion.
('41', 308, 3, 16, 589682) I should not care to insist on (b) if the insistence would hamper the proposed joint venture.
('41', 308, 3, 17, 589776) Much as I should like indigenous insurance enterprise, I am convinced that it is the foreign cloth that blocks the way as nothing else does.
('41', 308, 3, 18, 589917) If we can put this Himalayan obstacle out of the way, we shall easily cope with hillocks.

('41', 309, 1, 2, 590114) 355. DIFFERENCE STATED
('41', 309, 2, 3, 590137) I gladly publish the foregoing.
('41', 309, 2, 4, 590169) 1 It was made clear at those meetings of International Fellowship 2 that I had meant the principal religions of the world and I had maintained that all were true more or less and that all were necessarily imperfect.
('41', 309, 2, 5, 590385) Here therefore there is agreement.
('41', 309, 2, 6, 590420) But Mr. Irelands letter leaves on the mind the impression that there is a fundamental difference between him and me regarding conversion, no matter by what name it is called.
('41', 309, 2, 7, 590595) Let me extend the analogy of fragrance, faulty as all analogies are in their very nature.
('41', 309, 2, 8, 590685) The rose imparts its fragrance not in many ways but only one.
('41', 309, 2, 9, 590747) Those who have not the sense of smell will miss it.
('41', 309, 2, 10, 590799) You cannot feel the fragrance through the tongue or the ear or the skin.
('41', 309, 2, 11, 590872) So may you not receive spirituality except through the spiritual sense.
('41', 309, 2, 12, 590944) Hence have all religions recognized the necessity of that sense being awakened.
('41', 309, 2, 13, 591024) It is a second birth.
('41', 309, 2, 14, 591046) A man with intense spirituality may without speech or a gesture touch the hearts of millions who have never seen him and whom he has never seen.
('41', 309, 2, 15, 591191) The most eloquent preacher if he has not spirituality in him will fail to touch the hearts of his audience.
('41', 309, 2, 16, 591299) Therefore I venture to think that most of the effort of modern missions is not only useless but more often than not harmful.
('41', 309, 2, 17, 591424) At the root of missionary effort is also the assumption that ones own belief is true not only for oneself but for all the world; whereas the truth is that God reaches us 3 through millions of ways not understood by us.
('41', 309, 2, 18, 591643) In missionary effort therefore there is lack of real humility that instinctively recognizes human limitations and the limitless power of God.
('41', 309, 2, 19, 591785) I have no feeling that from a spiritual standpoint I am necessarily superior to the so called savage.
('41', 309, 2, 20, 591887) And spiritual superiority is a dangerous thing to feel.
('41', 309, 2, 21, 591943) It is not 4like many other things which we can perceive, analyse and prove through our senses.
('41', 309, 2, 22, 592038) If it is there, I cannot be deprived of it by any power on earth, and it will have its effect in its own due time.
('41', 309, 2, 23, 592153) But if in matters of medicine and other natural sciences, I feel my superiority over others, a thing of which I may be legitimately conscious, and if I have love for my fellow beings, I would naturally share my knowledge with them.
('41', 309, 2, 24, 592385) But things of the spirit I leave to God and thus keep the bond between fellow beings and myself pure, correct and within limits.
('41', 309, 2, 25, 592514) But I must not carry this argument any further.

('41', 310, 3, 7, 593452) But the hope lies in Imperialists never offering enough inducement and the native wit of the Indian emigrants seeing through the thin veil of Imperial maya.

('41', 311, 1, 2, 594414) 358. MARRIAGE OF THE OLD AND CHILD MARRIAGE
('41', 311, 2, 3, 594458) A gentleman from Surat writes to say: 1
('41', 311, 3, 4, 594498) His criticism of child marriages is largely correct.
('41', 311, 3, 5, 594551) If the writer goes through the articles in the previous issues of Navajivan, he will see that they have often severely criticized child marriages.
('41', 311, 3, 6, 594698) And I also know that these articles have averted some child marriages.
('41', 311, 3, 7, 594769) However, there is still room for a great deal of reform.
('41', 311, 3, 8, 594826) Society is not as much averse to child marriage as it is to marriage with old men.
('41', 311, 3, 9, 594909) In my opinion both these are equally objectionable.
('41', 311, 3, 10, 594961) Hence, there is no difference of opinion between this correspondent and myself with regard to condemnation of child marriage.
('41', 311, 3, 11, 595087) If I had the authority or if my pen had enough power, I would use it to prevent every child marriage.
('41', 311, 3, 12, 595189) Parents who marry their children at a tender age become their enemies and are responsible for making them dependent and weak.
('41', 311, 3, 13, 595315) However, the correspondents intention appears to be to uphold marriages of old men while discrediting child marriages.
('41', 311, 3, 14, 595434) The advantages of marrying an old man as stated by the correspondent seem to be ludicrous and also to ignore completely the poor girl or if there is any consideration for her it is only for her financial condition.
('41', 311, 3, 15, 595649) The writer appears to forget that consent of the girls who are married off to old men is never secured; perhaps, in his opinion, it is needless to think of it.
('41', 311, 3, 16, 595809) The correspondent seems to be wholly oblivious of the fact that marriage is a religious rite and, worse still, he fails to remember that marriage with an old man amounts to a doubly culpable child marriage, as in all such cases not only is the bride a child but the old man who despite age contemplates marriage can only be deemed a child, or something worse.
('41', 311, 3, 17, 596169) Although the husband may be living it is a kind of widowhood for the girl.
('41', 311, 3, 18, 596244) Society is least likely to be harmed if old men who cannot control their passions or who for some other reason wish to marry, do so with old or mature women prepared to enter into such relationship with them.
('41', 311, 4, 19, 596453) CONGRATULATIONS The result of the above mentioned article has been that a poor girl has been spared as the elderly gentleman who was going to marry her realized his mistake on reading the article and gave up

('41', 312, 1, 2, 596740) the idea of another marriage.
('41', 312, 1, 3, 596770) I congratulate this gentleman on this welcome result.
('41', 312, 1, 4, 596824) Let us hope that whenever in the future he is moved by passion he will restrain himself, thinking of the girls good and of society, and even the country and also remembering God.
('41', 312, 1, 5, 597003) This case should infuse greater enthusiasm in soical workers.
('41', 312, 1, 6, 597065) We find from this as well as other instance that have since occurred that social and other injustices can be prevented if timely stepsrestrained yet firmare taken against them.
('41', 312, 2, 7, 597242) WILL ANOTHER COW BE SAVED?
('41', 312, 3, 8, 597269) Some young girls have been rescued from being sold off to old men.
('41', 312, 3, 9, 597336) Bearing this in mind a gentleman from Ranpur writes to say : 1
('41', 312, 4, 10, 597399) On the strength of this letter, I do request this Modh Vanik gentleman of Bhavnagar not to go through this marriage.
('41', 312, 4, 11, 597516) At the age of 55, he should shrink from the thought of marrying a girl young enough to be his grand daughter.I hope leaders of the Modh community of Bhavnagar will take all steps needed to prevent this marriage.
('41', 312, 4, 12, 597728) In fact in such cases wherever people in general are alert, not only the leaders of small castes, but the entire public and even the State itself, should act as protectors of the young girls and it is their dharma to rescue girls who are being sold in this manner.
('41', 312, 4, 13, 597993) Young men are their guardians and if they don the armour of virtue, humility and courage and do their duty they will be able to rescue all the poor young girls and there is no doubt they can.

('41', 312, 8, 17, 598299) MY DEAR GOVIND, I have your chatty letter.
('41', 312, 8, 18, 598342) I am glad you were able to walk all that distance without any discomfort.
('41', 312, 8, 19, 598416) I am getting well.
('41', 312, 8, 20, 598435) I note what you say about the enema.
('41', 312, 8, 21, 598472) The doctors who guided me in Bangalore insisted upon permanganate, but the solution is very weak.
('41', 312, 8, 22, 598570) It is just rose colour that is required.
('41', 312, 9, 23, 598611) 1 The letter is not translated here.

('41', 313, 6, 9, 598906) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 313, 6, 10, 598939) Simplicity is a matter of herat.
('41', 313, 6, 11, 598972) But lest we deceive ourselves, the ideal is not to possess anything which the poorest on earth do not.
('41', 313, 6, 12, 599075) Yo cannot force you wife to abandon ornaments against her will, but you must seek to conquer her through selfless love devoid of animal passion and through your own daily increasing self denial.
('41', 313, 6, 13, 599270) Without denying your father and being always ready to serve him, you can live separately from him and bring up an untouchable boy in the manner you suggest.
('41', 313, 6, 14, 599427) I am afraid it will not be possible for me to take your sister because she would not know Hindustani.
('41', 313, 6, 15, 599529) You should give her there all the training that she needs.
('41', 313, 7, 16, 599588) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 315, 3, 6, 600622) But if only for health reasons I must not attend the Conference.
('41', 315, 3, 7, 600687) It would delight my heart if your prophecy comes true and there is a heart union established between Hindus and Mussalmans and Sikhs of the Punjab.
('41', 315, 3, 8, 600835) I know that then Hindu Muslim unity is assured and my faith in the power of that unity is such that I would say swaraj is assured.
('41', 315, 3, 9, 600966) Anyway I hope that the Conference will not forget or neglect khadi.

('41', 316, 3, 4, 601800) MY DEAR PRATAP, I havent got you to build me a tannery, but all the same I have now got something which passes as a tannery because I have got a crank like myself who knows much about the business to do the work.
('41', 316, 3, 5, 602013) I would like you when you come to Ahmedabad to look at it.
('41', 316, 3, 6, 602072) But I would like you to send me some literature on tanning which a layman may understand and do something with, or tell me where I can get it.

('41', 316, 8, 12, 602375) You say Rs. 3,000 is so little to me, and they are much to the widow and her boy.
('41', 316, 8, 13, 602457) You little know that I am poorer than the widow.
('41', 316, 8, 14, 602506) For I do not possess any property over which I can go to any court of law much less to Privy Council.
('41', 316, 8, 15, 602608) I have no money of my own.
('41', 316, 8, 16, 602635) I am a humble trustee holding some funds for well defined trusts.
('41', 316, 8, 17, 602701) I may not deviate the funds without exposing myself to the charge of breach of trust.
('41', 316, 8, 18, 602787) You should approach a monied man.

('41', 317, 3, 5, 603088) It is a long letter.
('41', 317, 3, 6, 603109) He 1 would like me to go to Europe, but he himself is not likely to be in his place before June.
('41', 317, 3, 7, 603206) I expect a reply to another letter from him.
('41', 317, 3, 8, 603251) I am in no hurry to go.
('41', 317, 3, 9, 603275) I would therefore like to await further news from him.
('41', 317, 3, 10, 603330) Somehow or other I cant put my heart into this proposed visit.
('41', 317, 3, 11, 603393) My heart is in the boycott.
('41', 317, 3, 12, 603421) If we cannot negotiate the boycott, I am supremely content to go on with the khadi programme.
('41', 317, 3, 13, 603515) I would like you to visualize the marvellous effect that the khadi movement has produced.
('41', 317, 3, 14, 603605) If the mill owners had been honest, we should have made enormous strides.
('41', 317, 3, 15, 603679) I have now got the figures for khadi production by the mills.
('41', 317, 3, 16, 603741) Here they are for three years.
('41', 317, 3, 17, 603772) The figures are for nine months ending December.

('41', 317, 6, 21, 603987) 94.3 million yards in one year!
('41', 317, 6, 22, 604019) It means all that money taken away from the mouths of the paupers.
('41', 317, 6, 23, 604086) It shows also the potentiality of the khadi movement.

('41', 318, 2, 3, 604322) Tuesday [March 27, 1928] 1
('41', 318, 3, 4, 604349) BHAISHRI BHANSALI, You know that I have discussed the matter with Lilabehn 2. She is of the same opinion as the others.
('41', 318, 3, 5, 604469) Despite all the opposition, I find the general opinion is that if you wish to stay on you may do so.
('41', 318, 3, 6, 604570) But that can only be if you believe that all these well wishers are in the wrong.
('41', 318, 3, 7, 604652) It is quite contrary to the rules of the Ashram if you think it wrong to work even as sacrifice.
('41', 318, 3, 8, 604749) But I do not insist on your accepting my opinion and doing accordingly.
('41', 318, 3, 9, 604821) Return this letter after reading it, as also the others.
('41', 318, 3, 10, 604878) If you wish, I will give you a copy of each.
('41', 318, 3, 11, 604923) Ponder deeply over all these things, and then, if you wish, we will discuss the matter personally.
('41', 318, 3, 12, 605022) I do not wish to put any kind of pressure on you.

('41', 318, 7, 16, 605184) March 27, 1928
('41', 318, 8, 17, 605199) After having listened to these bhajans I feel that there is no difference between you and me.
('41', 318, 8, 18, 605293) At present my health is such that I cannot attend any function and the doctors too have forbidden me to attend meetings.
('41', 318, 8, 19, 605414) Because I am here today, do not think that I am fit.
('41', 318, 8, 20, 605467) After a long interval and for the first time since I returned to Ahmedabad, I am attending a meeting and that too because Shri Banker and others insisted that I should give some advice to the Bhangis of the city.
('41', 318, 8, 21, 605680) Truly speaking, you are the high caste Hindus.
('41', 318, 8, 22, 605727) Your sacrifice is very great.
('41', 318, 8, 23, 605757) The so called caste Hindus are more responsible for your blemishes than you are.
('41', 318, 8, 24, 605838) You come to have these because they fors ook you.
('41', 318, 8, 25, 605888) I wish you would get rid of these vices now.
('41', 318, 8, 26, 605933) I can clean

('41', 318, 9, 29, 606058) Among those present were Kasturba Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel and Anasuyabehn Sarabhai.

('41', 319, 1, 3, 606332) Why should you prevent others from doing it?
('41', 319, 1, 4, 606377) The caste Hindus regard your work as low and of little value but my honest opinion is that it is the best.
('41', 319, 1, 5, 606484) As long as one cannot do that work well, one cannot be said to have served well.
('41', 319, 1, 6, 606565) What is the condition of the streets and lanes of Ahmedabad?
('41', 319, 1, 7, 606626) I say this because I clean everything myself.
('41', 319, 1, 8, 606672) You should feel that by doing this work, you render the greatest and the most important service to the city.
('41', 319, 1, 9, 606781) Why do you object if others participate in such service?
('41', 319, 1, 10, 606838) If I had my say I would get the lanes and latrines of Ahmedabad cleaned by High School boys and make the city so beautiful that I could proudly invite everyone to visit it.
('41', 319, 1, 11, 607011) The key to this lies in your hands.
('41', 319, 1, 12, 607047) Regard this as an act of service and perform it with diligence because the citys health depends mainly on it.
('41', 319, 1, 13, 607157) If you realize this you can remove many of the difficulties faced by Vallabhbhai 1, and you will receive applause from the citizens and at the same time you will put your betters to shame.
('41', 319, 1, 14, 607346) I have no faith in your claim that the evil of drinking has decreased.
('41', 319, 1, 15, 607417) I think out of every sixteen persons two abstain from drinking and fourteen indulge in it.
('41', 319, 1, 16, 607508) I do not believe that anyone runs into debt for food; they do so only for indulging in pleasures.
('41', 319, 1, 17, 607606) You must get rid of all these addictions.
('41', 319, 1, 18, 607648) You should teach your children not to eat left overs.
('41', 319, 1, 19, 607702) You too should take a vow to the same effect.
('41', 319, 1, 20, 607748) You should accept only that which can be accepted without humiliation.
('41', 319, 1, 21, 607819) In this way you will be able to train your children well.
('41', 319, 1, 22, 607877) It does not matter if you are not educated, but you must learn how to count so that no one can deceive you.
('41', 319, 1, 23, 607985) You must also cultivate habits of personal cleanliness.
('41', 319, 1, 24, 608041) From the leaders of society you have only to learn self purification.
('41', 319, 1, 25, 608111) For that you must give up all your addictions.
('41', 319, 1, 26, 608158) If, in spite of the khadi cap that you wear, you have addictions, you will disgrace the cap.
('41', 319, 1, 27, 608251) I will also get you good help from the Municipality and from the rich men of Ahmedabad when you do something on your own.

('41', 320, 2, 4, 608632) You have given me a doleful picture of the state of things there.
('41', 320, 2, 5, 608698) My advice just now is for you quietly to cultivate public opinion there.
('41', 320, 2, 6, 608771) From what you write it appears to me that the Government is not unsympathetic but it is timid and too sensitive to orthodox opinion.
('41', 320, 2, 7, 608904) You should tell me also whether you are ready to offer satyagraha at Suchindram or Thiruvarppu.

('41', 321, 3, 5, 610053) You must always write in as beautiful a hand as you have written this time.
('41', 321, 3, 6, 610129) Next time you write, let me know your daily time table of work.
('41', 321, 3, 7, 610193) Write to me how you find the climate there.
('41', 321, 3, 8, 610237) There is a talk of my going to Europe, but nothing is fixed yet.
('41', 321, 3, 9, 610302) Even if I go, it will take some time.
('41', 321, 3, 10, 610340) Do you get any time there to read?

('41', 321, 8, 17, 610644) Mr. Andrews has forgotten to tell me about your intention to see me at the Ashram.
('41', 321, 8, 18, 610727) I shall be delighted to see you on the 8th April.

('41', 322, 2, 3, 611050) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, March 28, 1928
('41', 322, 3, 4, 611088) MY DEAR C. R., I have your letter about the proposed European visit.
('41', 322, 3, 5, 611157) I have myself no heart in it, nor have I any confidence in myself about making it successful; but an interview with Rolland still remains an attraction.
('41', 322, 3, 6, 611310) All the reputation I enjoy in the West is borrowed from him and I feel that if I meet him face to face, there may be disillusionment on many points.
('41', 322, 3, 7, 611459) It may be that we should come closer than we ever were.
('41', 322, 3, 8, 611515) I do attach considerable importance to our knowing each other much better than we do.
('41', 322, 3, 9, 611601) I quite agree with you that there is nothing to gain from the health point of view.
('41', 322, 3, 10, 611685) I might possibly suffer, and health is no consideration, whatsoever in the proposed trip.
('41', 322, 3, 11, 611775) From that point of view any hill station in India would be infinitely superior for me.
('41', 322, 3, 12, 611862) I feel also with you that the withdrawal of my presence is likely to unsettle things a bit especially in Bardoli.
('41', 322, 3, 13, 611976) Foreign cloth boycott can certainly make no headway during my absence.
('41', 322, 3, 14, 612047) But now that you are all gathering together at Calcutta.
('41', 322, 3, 15, 612104) I would like you to discuss the proposed visit at the Council meeting.
('41', 322, 3, 16, 612175) I am most anxious that I should not become exclusive and should be humble enough to arrive at truth no matter from what source it comes.
('41', 322, 3, 17, 612312) I am sorry about the defalcations, but I shall accept your warning not to disturb myself or discuss them.
('41', 322, 3, 18, 612418) I understand what you say about Ramachandran.
('41', 322, 3, 19, 612464) I want you to write him a warm letter and go out of your way to draw him towards you.
('41', 322, 3, 20, 612550) He is kind of Chetty also, for he did wonderfully well in the way of khadi at Jamia.
('41', 322, 3, 21, 612635) I must not forget one thing, though, about your reference to the defalcations.
('41', 322, 3, 22, 612714) If the defaulter gives you Rs. 500 and tenders an apology for publication, you should be entirely satisfied.
('41', 322, 3, 23, 612823) But this is an unconsidered opinion of a layman.
('41', 322, 3, 24, 612872) What do you say to my exploit in conducting an exclusively milk experiment?
('41', 322, 3, 25, 612948) I do not want to be told you swooned at my saying it is a literally milk and water experiment.

('41', 324, 2, 3, 614278) I am sure that the Amsterdam International, if it was placed in the same condition as the White Trades Union of Johannesburg, would not behave otherwise than the latter; nor would it have acted otherwise than Mr. Ramsay MacDonald or Mr. Lansbury if its members had found themselves in their position.

('41', 324, 3, 5, 614602) 378. THE DOCTRINE OF FRIGHTFULNESS In answer to a question put by a member of the late Hunter Committee, General Dyer admitted that Jallianwala was designed to create frightfulness.
('41', 324, 3, 6, 614784) In making the admission the late General enunciated no new doctrine.
('41', 324, 3, 7, 614853) Indeed the ablest Civil Service in the world has laid the foundation of its greatness on frightfulnesses.
('41', 324, 3, 8, 614959) In pursuance of this well known policy, according to the information received at the time of going to press it appears that summary steps are now to be taken against the farmers of Bardoli in order to compel submission.
('41', 324, 3, 9, 615179) For eight preliminary notices of forfeiture have been served upon certain satyagrahis of Bardoli.
('41', 324, 3, 10, 615277) The names of these seem to have been carefully chosen, for all of them happen to be banias of note.
('41', 324, 3, 11, 615377) The choice has been so made presumably because banias who have the reputation of being weak and timid are expected to yield under notices of forfeiture.
('41', 324, 3, 12, 615530) What can be more natural, officialdom would argue, than that banias weakening, the others must follow suit.
('41', 324, 3, 13, 615638) Satyagrahis need not be surprised at this first show of frightfulness.
('41', 324, 3, 14, 615709) They have been repeatedly told to expect forfeitures and worse.
('41', 324, 3, 15, 615773) Let them now show their strength if they have it in them.

('41', 324, 4, 18, 615932) He had written that the International Labour Movement in Europe in its bulletin entitled The Triumph of Race Hatred had condemned the South African Trades Union Congress of white workers for its refusal to affiliate the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union (I.C.W.U.) of coloured workers which was already affiliated to the Amsterdam International, that is, International Federation of Trades Unions.
('41', 324, 4, 19, 616336) Andrews had also regretted the action of Ramsay MacDonald and the Labour Parliamentary party in England in acquiescing in the appointment of the Simon Commission on a racial basis.

('41', 325, 1, 2, 616559) 379. THE NATIONAL WEEK The national week comes upon us with seasonlike regularity and has found us more or less wanting since after 1922. The 6th April to 13th April should be regarded as days of privilege, introspection, intense national activity and self purification.
('41', 325, 1, 3, 616830) These precious seven days should be days of stock taking and heart searching.
('41', 325, 1, 4, 616908) The morning of 6th April 1919 found an India awakened to a sense of her dignity.
('41', 325, 1, 5, 616989) Hindus, Mussalmans and others composing the nation felt themselves united like blood brothers as they are in reality, if they would but recognize themselves as sons of the soil.
('41', 325, 1, 6, 617167) 6th of April 1919 found an India endowed with a true spirit of swadeshi which culminated in khadi and which is now feeding according to the latest figures over 90,000 poor spinners.
('41', 325, 1, 7, 617349) The spirit thus awakened continued to advance during 1920 and 1921 and we seemed to be within an ace of statutory swaraj.
('41', 325, 1, 8, 617471) But that swaraj did not come and there was a set back.
('41', 325, 1, 9, 617526) Apparently since then there has been only an ebb.
('41', 325, 1, 10, 617576) Hindus and Mussalmans are flying at each others throats.
('41', 325, 1, 11, 617633) Instead of swadeshi we have the cry for boycott of British goods pending settlement as if support of Japanese goods including Japans cheap calico can ever be a substitute for swadeshi, i.e., khadi, exclusive of all foreign cloth.
('41', 325, 1, 12, 617863) After much research, reasoning and experience, we seemed in 1920 21 to have come to the conclusion that the only practical, effective and necessary swadeshi was khadi, not pending any settlement but for all time or such time as we could discover a better and more paying occupation for the starving millions.
('41', 325, 1, 13, 618172) I have seen no new argument in support of boycott of British goods only as distinguished from foreign goods.
('41', 325, 1, 14, 618281) No new situation has arisen to warrant the belief that boycott of British goods is a practical proposition and that the use of foreign cloth other than British is not almost equally detrimental to the best interest of India.
('41', 325, 1, 15, 618506) Would that those who are supporting the cry of boycott of British goods will seriously think over their programme, and, if necessary, revise their plan and join the khadi movement with the whole hearted conviction that it and it alone can bring about complete boycott, not merely of British cloth but of all foreign cloth.
('41', 325, 1, 16, 618829) But whether they do so or not, I am sure they do not make of support to foreign cloth other than British cloth a matter of principle.
('41', 325, 1, 17, 618963) And if I am right in my supposition, let them support the sales of
('41', 326, 0, 1, 619030) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 327
('41', 326, 1, 2, 619072) khadi during the National Week.
('41', 326, 1, 3, 619104) If they will but study the progress of the khadi movement during the past seven years that it has been going on, they will discover that the charkha has more potency than they have ever dreamt of.
('41', 326, 1, 4, 619301) It is potent enough, if it receives the whole hearted and active support of politically minded India, to bring about boycott of foreign cloth even without the assistance of our mills.
('41', 326, 1, 5, 619485) With the active and organized support of the latter, boycott of foreign cloth becomes a much easier proposition.
('41', 326, 1, 6, 619598) Indeed the mill owners hold the trump card if only they would play it for the sake of the nation.
('41', 326, 1, 7, 619696) They have at their disposal a ready made extensive organization, which, if they devote it to the service of the nation, can simplify the campaign of boycott and arm the nation with the power it so much needs.
('41', 326, 1, 8, 619905) And why will not Hindus and Mussalmans recall those precious seven days and shed all fear, mutual distrust and weakness?
('41', 326, 1, 9, 620026) Let me not forget the so called untouchables, the classes that we Hindus have been guilty of suppressing.
('41', 326, 1, 10, 620132) Shall we not have the vision to see that in suppressing a sixth (or whatever the number) of ourselves, we have depressed ourselves?
('41', 326, 1, 11, 620264) No man takes another down a pit without descending into it himself and sinning in the bargain.
('41', 326, 1, 12, 620359) It is not the suppressed that sin.
('41', 326, 1, 13, 620394) It is the suppressor who has to answer for his crime against those whom he suppresses.

('41', 326, 6, 19, 620613) I do hope that there will be an adequate response to Sjt.
('41', 326, 6, 20, 620671) Jerajanis legitimate wish and hope.
('41', 326, 6, 21, 620707) Bombay has always been sens itive to national moods.
('41', 326, 6, 22, 620760) Bombay laid the foundation of the national khadi movement by opening the first khadi bhandar.
('41', 326, 6, 23, 620854) The figures given in the letter are instructive.
('41', 326, 6, 24, 620903) The great drop in 1925 is to be
('41', 326, 7, 25, 620935) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('41', 326, 7, 26, 620972) The correspondent had given the figures of sale of khadi during the National Weeks from 1922 to 1927. He had hoped that in view of greater variety, improvement in the quality of khadi and a greater swadeshi spirit there would be greater response in the coming National Week.
('41', 326, 7, 27, 621247) He had also announced a discount of one anna per rupee on khadi purchased from April 1 to 15. Vide also The National Week, 1 4 1928.
('41', 327, 0, 1, 621380) 328 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 327, 1, 2, 621422) accounted for by the fact there was another large khadi store opened in Kalbadevi Road.
('41', 327, 1, 3, 621510) Nevertheless the figures for the other years are an eloquent proof of the statement that Bombay is the proper barometer for the politically minded India.
('41', 327, 1, 4, 621664) The figures for 1927 show a decided improvement upon 1926. Will Bombay rise to those of 1922?
('41', 327, 1, 5, 621758) Not that even such a rise will be anything commensurate with what is required for the boycott we want and can have if we would but show the necessary measure of sacrifice and determination.
('41', 327, 1, 6, 621948) Another notice I have is from the Shuddha Khadi Bhandar, Richey Road, Ahmedabad.
('41', 327, 1, 7, 622029) That Bhandar also proposes during the National Week to give discount from one anna to four annas in the rupee according to the variety required.
('41', 327, 1, 8, 622174) I hope that all khadi organizations whether owned by the Association or certified will put forth special efforts to bring khadi to the notice of the public and that the public will make a liberal response.
('41', 327, 2, 9, 622380) KHADI TOUR IN BENGAL It is perhaps necessary to emphasize in Bengal that the khadi tour organized by Sjt.
('41', 327, 2, 10, 622486) Satis Chandra Das Gupta is also the All India Deshbandhu Memorial tour.
('41', 327, 2, 11, 622558) Sheth Jamnalalji, Sjt.
('41', 327, 2, 12, 622581) Rajagopalachari, Sjt.
('41', 327, 2, 13, 622603) Manilal Kothari and Sjt.
('41', 327, 2, 14, 622628) Shankerlal Banker are about to tour in Bengal as from the 5th of next month in the interest of khadi, which an all India committee decided on the death of Deshbandhu should be the centre and the circumference of an all India memorial for the late Chittaranjan Das, the uncrowned king of Bengal.
('41', 327, 2, 15, 622923) There is a wave of swadeshi passing over Bengal at present.
('41', 327, 2, 16, 622983) But I suspect that the true meaning of swadeshi is missed in the forest of words that surround that simple but life giving word.
('41', 327, 2, 17, 623112) Let us adhere to its root meaning and we shall discover nothing but khadi in it.
('41', 327, 2, 18, 623193) Swadehsi is of ones own country.
('41', 327, 2, 19, 623226) Among things of the villagers daily use, cloth is the only thing that is not of ones own country.
('41', 327, 2, 20, 623324) That which they can easily make themselves is also cloth.
('41', 327, 2, 21, 623382) Hence the swadeshi that they can realize and without which they must starve is khadi and nothing else.
('41', 327, 2, 22, 623485) Hence is khadi the only real swadeshi for every patriot.
('41', 327, 2, 23, 623542) I hope therefore that Sheth Jamnalalji and his companions will be whole heartedly assisted by Bengal wherever they go.
('41', 327, 2, 24, 623661) Every yard of khadi bought and every donation given to the Memorial is so much help to the boycott movement and to the poorest in the land.

('41', 328, 1, 2, 623843) BOYCOTT AND STUDENTS The Principal of a college writes : 1
('41', 328, 2, 3, 623902) The promoters of the boycott movement are dragging the students into their movement.
('41', 328, 2, 4, 623987) When the students leave their schools and colleges and join any demonstration, they mingle with the rowdies of the place and have to be responsible for all the outrages of the badmashes and often receive the first blows from the policemans batons.
('41', 328, 2, 5, 624235) They, besides, incur the displeasure of the school and college authorities whose punishment they have to submit to; they further disobey their guardians who might refuse to finance them further, which spells their ruin.
('41', 328, 2, 6, 624455) I can understand youth movements which aim at doing such constructive work as teaching the ignorant peasants, spreading knowledge of sani tation, etc., during holidays; but to see them turn against their own parents and teachers and walk along streets in questionable company and help the breaking of law and order is a sorry spectacle.
('41', 328, 2, 7, 624792) May I request you to advise the politicians not to draw the students from their legitimate work to make their demonstration more effective?
('41', 328, 2, 8, 624932) The correspondent has written in the hope of my condemning the participation by the student world in active political work.
('41', 328, 2, 9, 625056) But I am sorry to have to disappoint him.
('41', 328, 2, 10, 625098) He should have known that in 1920 21 I had not an inconsiderable share in drawing students out of their schools and colleges and inducing them to undertake political duty carrying with it the risk of imprisonment.
('41', 328, 2, 11, 625312) I think it is their clear duty to take leading part in the political movement of their country.
('41', 328, 2, 12, 625408) They are doing so all the world over.
('41', 328, 2, 13, 625446) In India where political cons ciousness has till recently been unfortunately confined in a large measure to the English educated class, their duty is, indeed, greater.
('41', 328, 2, 14, 625614) In China and Egypt it was the students who have made the national movement possible.
('41', 328, 2, 15, 625699) They cannot do less in India.
('41', 328, 2, 16, 625729) What the Principal might have urged was the necessity of students observing the rules of non violence and acquiring control over the rowdies, instead of being controlled by them.
('41', 328, 3, 17, 625908) MACAULAYS DREAMS
('41', 328, 4, 18, 625925) A friend sends me the following quotation from Macaulays Life and Letters : 2
('41', 328, 5, 19, 626003) On the 7th March 1835 Lord William Bentinck decided that the great object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of European

('41', 329, 0, 1, 626178) 330 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 329, 1, 2, 626220) literature and science among the natives of India; two of the orientalists retired from the Committee of Public Instruction; .
('41', 329, 1, 3, 626347) and Macaulay entered upon the functions of President.
('41', 329, 2, 4, 626401) Our English schools, said Lord Macaulay, are flourishing wonderfully.
('41', 329, 2, 5, 626471) The effect of this education on the Hindoos is prodigious.
('41', 329, 2, 6, 626530) No Hindoo who has received an English education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion.
('41', 329, 2, 7, 626627) It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up, there will not be a single idolator among the respectable classes of Bengal thirty years hence.
('41', 329, 2, 8, 626792) . I do not know whether Macaulays dream that English educated India would abandon its religious beliefs has been realized.
('41', 329, 2, 9, 626915) But we know too that he had another dream, namely, to supply through English educated India clerks and the like for the English rulers.
('41', 329, 2, 10, 627051) The dream has certainly been realized beyond all expectations.
('41', 329, 3, 11, 627114) PEACE AMIDST STRIFE Before now I have shared with the reader some of the beautiful things that a friend sends me from time to time for my Monday silence.
('41', 329, 3, 12, 627268) I am tempted to share with him the following further instalment which has been lying with me in my jacket for a long time.
('41', 329, 3, 13, 627391) All but the last two are extracts from Buddhistic writings.
('41', 329, 3, 14, 627451) The last but one is from Emerson and the last of all is a Hindu proverb.
('41', 329, 4, 15, 627524) Like a beautiful flower full of colour, without scent, the fine words of him who does not act accordingly are fruitless.
('41', 329, 5, 16, 627645) A mind unshaken by lifes vicissitudes, unstirred by grief or passion, is the greatest of all blessings.
('41', 329, 6, 17, 627749) There never was, there never will be, a man who is always praised, or a man who is always blamed.
('41', 329, 7, 18, 627847) As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, so wise men falter not amidst blame or praise.
('41', 329, 7, 19, 627937) Let us live happily, then, not hating those who hate us.
('41', 329, 7, 20, 627994) Let us live free from hatred among men who hate.
('41', 329, 7, 21, 628043) Let us live happily, then, free from ailments among the ailing.
('41', 329, 7, 22, 628107) Let us dwell free from afflictions among men who are sick at heart.
('41', 329, 7, 23, 628175) Let us live happily, then, free care among the busy.
('41', 329, 7, 24, 628228) Let us dwell free from yearning among men who are anxious.
('41', 329, 7, 25, 628287) Let us live happily, then, though we call nothing our own.
('41', 329, 8, 26, 628346) We shall become like the bright Gods, who feed on happiness.
('41', 329, 9, 27, 628407) The greatest prayer is patience.
('41', 329, 10, 28, 628440) Never in this world does hatred cease by hatred.
('41', 330, 0, 1, 628489) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 331
('41', 330, 1, 2, 628531) Hatred ceases by love: this is always its nature.
('41', 330, 1, 3, 628581) Reverence and lowliness, Contentment and gratitude, The hearing of the Lord at due season.
('41', 330, 1, 4, 628672) This is the greatest blessing.
('41', 330, 1, 5, 628703) As a mother, even at the risk of her own life, protects her son, her only son: so let a man cultivate goodwill without measure among all beings.
('41', 330, 2, 6, 628848) Let him cultivate goodwill without measure toward the whole world, above, below, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of differing or opposing interests.
('41', 330, 2, 7, 629001) Let a man remain steadfastly in that state of mind all the while he is awake, whether he be standing, walking, sitting or lying down.
('41', 330, 2, 8, 629135) This state of heart is the best in the world.
('41', 330, 2, 9, 629181) By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.
('41', 330, 3, 10, 629317) As the beeinjuring not
('41', 330, 4, 11, 629340) The flower, its colour, or scent

('41', 330, 6, 13, 629405) So let the wise man dwell
('41', 330, 7, 14, 629431) Upon the truth.
('41', 330, 8, 15, 629447) Ye taught my lips a single speech
('41', 330, 9, 16, 629481) And a thousand silences.

('41', 330, 11, 19, 629597) 381. ON FASTING The reader is familiar with the letters of a Polish professor from which I have published extracts from time to time in these columns.
('41', 330, 12, 20, 629748) In one of his letters referring to my fasts he writes : 2
('41', 330, 13, 21, 629806) I publish this as being of use to the reader who is interested in such researches.
('41', 330, 13, 22, 629889) The physical and moral value of fasting is being more and more recognized day by day.
('41', 330, 13, 23, 629975) A vast number of diseases can be more surely treated by judicious fasting than by all sorts of nostrums including the dreadful injectionsdreadful not because for the pain they cause but because of the injurious by products which

('41', 330, 14, 25, 630291) The correspondent had narrated his experiments in fasting and said that it not only increased bodily activity but also spiritual en lightenment.
('41', 331, 0, 1, 630436) 332 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 331, 1, 2, 630478) often result from their use.
('41', 331, 1, 3, 630507) More mischief than we are aware of is done by the drug treatment.
('41', 331, 1, 4, 630573) But not many cases of harm done by fasting can be cited.
('41', 331, 1, 5, 630630) Increased vitality is almost the universal experience of those that have fasted.
('41', 331, 1, 6, 630711) For real rest body and mind is possible only during fasting.
('41', 331, 1, 7, 630772) Suspension of daily work is hardly rest without the rest that the over taxed and overworked digestive apparatus needss in a multitude of cases.
('41', 331, 1, 8, 630916) The moral effect of fasti ng,while it is considerable, is not so easily demonstrable.
('41', 331, 1, 9, 631002) 1 For moral res ults there has to be perfect co operation from the mind.
('41', 331, 1, 10, 631075) And there is dan ger of self deception.
('41', 331, 1, 11, 631115) I know of many instances in which fasting underta ken for moral results has been overdone.
('41', 331, 1, 12, 631206) To a limited extent it is a most valuable agent if the person fasting knows what he is doing.
('41', 331, 1, 13, 631300) There was considerable force in the warning given by the Prophet against his disciples copying his fasting over and above the semi fasts of Ramzan.My Maker sends me food enough when I fast, not so to you, said the Prophet.
('41', 331, 1, 14, 631523) Of what use is a spiritual fast when the spirit hankers more after food the longer the body is starved?

('41', 331, 3, 16, 631650) 382. TWO CORRECTIONS
('41', 331, 4, 17, 631671) Two lamentable errors have crept into the footnote to Mr. Irelands letter printed at page 93 in Young India 2 of the 22nd instant.
('41', 331, 4, 18, 631802) About the middle of the column one reads: God reaches earth through millions of ways not understood by us. The stenographer heard earth when us was spoken.
('41', 331, 4, 19, 631958) The sixth line after this one reads: It is like many other things which we can perceive, etc.
('41', 331, 4, 20, 632052) The context would show that not is obviously omitted from the sentence.
('41', 331, 4, 21, 632124) It should read: It is not like many other things, etc.

('41', 331, 6, 23, 632202) 1 The correspondent had written: Whenever I have a moral or intellectual difficulty, I fast.
('41', 331, 6, 24, 632295) Once I had a difficulty with a printer who delayed my work in order to print other more profitable things.
('41', 331, 6, 25, 632402) By fasting I succeeded in changing his mind.

('41', 332, 3, 4, 632603) DEAR FRIEND, Though the translation of your very kind and energetic letter has been with me for three days, I am able to reach it only at the last moment.
('41', 332, 3, 5, 632758) But I cannot let the post go without sending you a line if only to thank you for your friendly frankness.
('41', 332, 3, 6, 632864) The matter you have discussed is of tremendous importance.
('41', 332, 3, 7, 632923) It is never out of my mind, if only because it is for the vindication of ahimsa that I love to live and should equally love to die.
('41', 332, 3, 8, 633055) But I see that I have not been able clearly to explain my position.
('41', 332, 3, 9, 633123) I must not however enter into any argument.
('41', 332, 3, 10, 633167) If God enables me to meet you this year we shall prayerfully discuss the matter and possibly come to a joint conclusion.
('41', 332, 3, 11, 633288) Before deciding finally I propose to await your cable or letter as the case may be.
('41', 332, 4, 12, 633372) Meanwhile please accept my best thanks for your cordiality and concern for me.

('41', 333, 2, 3, 633882) DEAR SISTER, I have your letter.
('41', 333, 2, 4, 633915) You are never without troubles.
('41', 333, 2, 5, 633947) But they should be treated as chasteners.
('41', 333, 2, 6, 633989) Dhirens case is difficult to advise upon.
('41', 333, 2, 7, 634031) 1 Idealistically he should disobey every order of externment and internment and submit to any punishment that may be givento him.
('41', 333, 2, 8, 634161) But that is a matter for himself to judge.
('41', 333, 2, 9, 634204) Before he can disobey the orders I have in mind, he must have the inner conviction that disobeying is a duty and imprisonment for disobe yance not a task but a matter of joy.
('41', 333, 2, 10, 634379) And such joy is possible only when one considers such imprisonments as conducive to individual as well as national growth.
('41', 333, 2, 11, 634502) But what actually should be done I cannot really confidently say.
('41', 333, 2, 12, 634568) You know Dhiren better than I do and after all Dhiren will be largely guided by what you would have him to do.
('41', 333, 2, 13, 634679) You must also consider to what extent you will be able to bear his imprisonment and sufferings, and then come to a conclusion.
('41', 333, 2, 14, 634806) Of course Dhiren if he submits to the externment order is due to come to the Ashram and stay as long as he likes.
('41', 333, 2, 15, 634920) There is always work for young men like him.
('41', 333, 2, 16, 634965) Nothing is yet fixed about the proposed visit.

('41', 335, 3, 6, 636554) I shall try to meet you as far as possible, but you might be called upon to face privations.
('41', 335, 3, 7, 636647) Bickerings at home too may be a national servants lot.
('41', 335, 3, 8, 636702) Thakkar Bapa saw Sir Purushottamdas about your salary and Sir Purushottamdas considers your receiving salary from the Central Committee as the most natural thing and Rs. 150 as quite reasonable.
('41', 335, 3, 9, 636897) Now I shall have to ask for Rs. 200. I dont anticipate any difficulty.

('41', 335, 3, 11, 637038) Kalyanji and Naraharibhai it is impossible to spare.
('41', 335, 3, 12, 637091) Narahari has his own work chalked out for him and Kalyanji must be buried in Bardoli.
('41', 335, 3, 13, 637177) But I have an able businessman just now free for such work.
('41', 335, 3, 14, 637237) He is Jaisukhlal Gandhi.
('41', 335, 3, 15, 637262) He was in charge of Amreli Khadi Karyalaya.
('41', 335, 3, 16, 637306) It is now being rearranged and Jaisukhlal is being made free.
('41', 335, 3, 17, 637368) Your letter under reply comes just in time to keep him free.

('41', 335, 3, 19, 637535) This is likely to take a fortnight.
('41', 335, 3, 20, 637571) I have just had a talk with him as to whether he is prepared to do the thing.
('41', 335, 3, 21, 637649) He is agreeable provided I let him go to Amreli straightway and wind up the business there.

('41', 337, 3, 9, 639274) A letter has come, but it does not incline me to go.
('41', 337, 3, 10, 639327) If at all I go, it will be in May and I shall be back in October.
('41', 337, 3, 11, 639393) I shall try to stay with you in Mussoorie even if it is for only a few days.
('41', 337, 3, 12, 639470) I want to remain here up to April 13 2. Please let me have your opinion on what I wrote inviting the co operation of mills in the boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 337, 3, 13, 639626) 3 Write in detail about your health.
('41', 337, 3, 14, 639663) Are you now able to eat anything?
('41', 337, 4, 15, 639697) Yours, MOHANDS

('41', 337, 6, 17, 639770) 390. SPEECH AT ASHRAM ON RAMANAVAMI DAY March 30, 1928 The Rama of whom we sing is not the Rama of Valmiki, nor even the Rama of Tulsialthough his Ramayana is very dear to me and I consider it an incomparable work, I never seem to have enough of it once I start reading it.
('41', 337, 6, 18, 640044) Today, however, we shall not think of Tulsidass Rama or the Rama of Girdhars Ramayana, much less Rama of Kalidasa or Bhavabhuti.
('41', 337, 6, 19, 640173) There is great beauty in Bhavabhutis Uttararamacharita.
('41', 337, 6, 20, 640229) However, here is not the Rama whose name we may recite to cross to the other shore or whose name we may repeat in moments of despair.
('41', 337, 6, 21, 640363) If someone is suffering unbearable pain I tell him to repeat Ramanama.
('41', 337, 6, 22, 640434) If someone is unable to sleep I tell him too to repeat Ramanama.
('41', 337, 6, 23, 640499) This Rama is not the son
('41', 337, 7, 24, 640524) 1 From the contents it is clear that the letter was written in 1928. 2 Last day of the National Week 3 Vide What Can Our Mills Do?, 15 3 1928.
('41', 338, 0, 1, 640667) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 339
('41', 338, 1, 2, 640709) of Dasharatha or the husband of Sita.
('41', 338, 1, 3, 640747) In fact he is not the embodied Rama.
('41', 338, 1, 4, 640784) The Rama that dwells in our hearts cannot possibly have a physical form; the heart is no larger than a thumb and the Rama who dwells in some niche there could not have a body, nor could he have been born on the ninth day of the month of Chaitra in a certain year.
('41', 338, 1, 5, 641048) He is birthless.
('41', 338, 1, 6, 641065) He is the Creator, the Lord of the universe.
('41', 338, 1, 7, 641110) Hence the Rama whom one wishes to remember, and whom one should remember, is the Rama of ones own imagination, not the Rama of someone elses imagination.
('41', 338, 1, 8, 641264) If we keep this in mind, many doubts that trouble us would not arise at all.
('41', 338, 1, 9, 641341) Many times we wonder how the Rama who slew Vali could be called the Perfect One.
('41', 338, 1, 10, 641422) I too come across many such questions, and I am amused.
('41', 338, 1, 11, 641478) What great achievement is there in having slain someone, by fair means or foul, or to have destroyed the ten headed Ravana, if ever there was one such.
('41', 338, 1, 12, 641630) In this modern age, even if a Ravana is born, not with twenty but countless hands, a child standing behind a cannon can, by firing a single ball, send all his arms and heads flying.
('41', 338, 1, 13, 641812) We would not regard such a child superhuman; we would look upon him as a big mons ter.
('41', 338, 1, 14, 641899) I believe that we do not wish to acquire the strength of a super mons ter.
('41', 338, 1, 15, 641974) We would not attain peace by worshipping him.
('41', 338, 1, 16, 642020) We should worship Him, the Inner Ruler, who dwells in the hearts of all, yet transcends all and is the Lord of all.
('41', 338, 1, 17, 642136) It is He of whom we sing: Nirbalke bal Rama 1. The song also mentions Draupadis despair.
('41', 338, 1, 18, 642225) Now, what had Draupadi to do with an embodied Rama?
('41', 338, 1, 19, 642277) Yet, the poet has sung that Rama saved Draupadis honour.
('41', 338, 1, 20, 642334) The Rama mentioned here is the One who is common to all and yet comprehended by none.
('41', 338, 1, 21, 642420) It is this Rama whom we remember.
('41', 338, 1, 22, 642454) Between this Rama, the Inner Ruler, and Krishna there is no difference.
('41', 338, 1, 23, 642526) We celebrate the festival of Ramas birth so that we may practise some self restraint, and the children may enjoy innocent pleasures and learn some lesson by reading the Ramayana.
('41', 338, 1, 24, 642705) Man, who is himself embodied, cannot easily conceive God in any other form.
('41', 338, 1, 25, 642781) His imagination cannot go farther.
('41', 338, 1, 26, 642816) Therefore he conceives God as being incarnated in human form.
('41', 338, 1, 27, 642878) Hinduism has boundless tolerance.
('41', 338, 1, 28, 642912) Hence God has been described as descending in the forms of a fish, a boar and a man lion.
('41', 338, 1, 29, 643002) In this way having super imposed a form on God, men conceived Him as having a body and then imagined Him as taking birth.
('41', 338, 1, 30, 643124) And when we speak of His
('41', 338, 2, 31, 643149) 1 Rama, strength of the weak, the opening words of a popular song
('41', 339, 0, 1, 643215) 340 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 339, 1, 2, 643257) avatars to protect dharma whenever dharma declines and adharma flou rishes, it is true only in the manner and to the extent which I have just described; how else could we say that the birthless One took birth?
('41', 339, 1, 3, 643467) There is no reason to believe that any historical figure was the incarnation of God or God as a historical figure was born in human or any other form.
('41', 339, 1, 4, 643618) If a person is endowed with all the qualities of God, he may be called an incarnation of God.
('41', 339, 1, 5, 643712) It was because of their divine qualities that all those great men of the past were regarded by people as either plenary or partial incarnations.
('41', 339, 1, 6, 643857) And yet, knowing this, different devotees have described the same God in the Rama of Valmiki or Tulsidas and there is no harm in singing those bhajans.
('41', 339, 1, 7, 644009) If we bear in mind what I said earlier, we would not be deluded.
('41', 339, 1, 8, 644074) If someone wishes to confuse us confronting us with conundrums, we should tell him that we do not worship embodied Rama as conceived by anyone; we worship our own Rama who is flawless and formless.
('41', 339, 1, 9, 644272) As we cannot reach Him direct, we sing bhajans that describe Him as personified, and then try to apprehend Him in His purity.
('41', 339, 1, 10, 644398) So long as we are unable to see through the wall of the body, the qualities of truth and non violence will not become fully manifest in us.
('41', 339, 1, 11, 644538) When we think of pursuing truth, we must stop mistaking the body for ourselves, for we shall have to die in the pursuit of truth.
('41', 339, 1, 12, 644668) The same is true of non violence.
('41', 339, 1, 13, 644702) The body is the root of ego.
('41', 339, 1, 14, 644731) One who has attachment to the body cannot free himself of the ego.
('41', 339, 1, 15, 644798) I cannot become wholly free of violence so long as I have the feeling that this body is mine.
('41', 339, 1, 16, 644892) One who desires to have vision of God will have to transcend the body, to despise it, to court death.
('41', 339, 1, 17, 644994) It is only when we master these two qualities that we can be saved, that we can practise brahmacharya and so on.
('41', 339, 1, 18, 645107) How can we do without truth if we wish to practise such vows?
('41', 339, 1, 19, 645169) The face of truth is hidden by a golden lid.
('41', 339, 1, 20, 645214) 1 Why should we fear to speak the truth or to act truthfully?
('41', 339, 1, 21, 645276) How can we catch a glimpse of truth so long as we do not remove the glittering lid of untruth?
('41', 339, 1, 22, 645371) If anyone commits an offence, are we willing to love him instead of getting angry with him?
('41', 339, 1, 23, 645463) Although we sing that this world is insubstantial, do we know at all what the word implies?
('41', 339, 1, 24, 645555) If you wish to know me, says Rama, you must flee the world. But the body cannot be wished away.
('41', 339, 1, 25, 645651) Having trained ourselves to look upon the world as unreal, we may go about our

('41', 340, 1, 2, 645791) business as a matter of duty all the time and still find Rama.
('41', 340, 1, 3, 645854) That is the teaching of the Gita.
('41', 340, 1, 4, 645888) This is why I regard the Gita as a spiritual dictionary.
('41', 340, 1, 5, 645945) Tulsidas teaches us the same truth through beautiful poetry.
('41', 340, 1, 6, 646006) The key, however, is the one that I have given, namely, that the Rama in our hearts is the Ferryman who will take us across.
('41', 340, 1, 7, 646131) We cannot all create poetry as Tulsidas did.
('41', 340, 1, 8, 646176) But we can fill our life with poetry by bringing God into it.

('41', 340, 3, 11, 646337) March 31, 1928
('41', 340, 4, 12, 646352) Mahatmaji, addressing the students, expressed satisfaction that his suggestions had been carried out.
('41', 340, 4, 13, 646454) He however regretted that the boys were not as clean as they ought to be.
('41', 340, 4, 14, 646528) Putting on khaddar, he said, indicated that they were clean both bodily and in their hearts.
('41', 340, 5, 15, 646621) The mill owners, Gandhiji continued, were not extending their helping hand by becoming liberal in donating money.
('41', 340, 5, 16, 646735) He was conferring with the mill owners and requesting them to pay all the money subscribed by them to the Tilak Swaraj Fund for the benefit of the children unconditionally without interfering in any way in the administration of the schools, which must be solely left to the Labour Union.
('41', 340, 5, 17, 647023) Even if they did not give any money these schools would go on.
('41', 340, 6, 18, 647086) God is great and if you have faith in Him you would get money from any source, provided you have true ideals.
('41', 340, 7, 19, 647196) To teachers, Gandhiji said that they must not make any use of books for imparting education, as books spoiled eyes and blunted the intellect.
('41', 340, 7, 20, 647338) He himself had experienced that.
('41', 340, 7, 21, 647371) He understood that in Russia they were conducting one thousand schools for peasants and that they were giving education without the aid of books by making all possible use of the senses.
('41', 340, 7, 22, 647558) He asked them to clean their own houses and streets themselves and not to depend on others for doing the same.
('41', 340, 8, 23, 647669) Concluding, Mahatmaji asked them to make their schools ideal in every way, so that the boys and girls of the mill owners might envy them and the mill owners might be tempted to send their children to the labour schools.
('41', 340, 8, 24, 647889) On truth depended the foundation of education, and they must always resort to truth.

('41', 341, 3, 5, 648299) I was told that I could look forward to meeting you at Madras.
('41', 341, 3, 6, 648362) But that was not to be.
('41', 341, 3, 7, 648386) Will you kindly tell me why you have preferred the cry of boycott of British goods, principally British cloth, to boycott of foreign cloth and why also boycott of British cloth only pending settlement?
('41', 341, 3, 8, 648588) I hope you have regained your original health.

('41', 341, 7, 13, 648750) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, March 31, 1928
('41', 341, 8, 14, 648788) MY DEAR SHANTIKUMAR, I have your letter.
('41', 341, 8, 15, 648829) The terms that I think the mill owners should agree to are as follows : (1) The prices should be regulated by a special committee representing all interests.
('41', 341, 8, 16, 648987) (2) The production both as to kind and quantity should also be regulated by the said committee.
('41', 341, 8, 17, 649083) (3) Mills should cease to sell any mill cloth under the name of khadi and should cease within three months at the outside of the date of acceptance of terms to manufacture any cloth that is likely to compete with khadi and to this end the committee will specify from time to time what the mills may not manufacture.
('41', 341, 8, 18, 649399) (4) Mills will organize not only the sales of mill cloth but they
('41', 342, 0, 1, 649465) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 343
('41', 342, 1, 2, 649507) will sell khadi also through the agencies thus organized.
('41', 342, 1, 3, 649565) (5) Mills should use no foreign yarn, no foreign silk, no foreign wool nor artificial silk.
('41', 342, 1, 4, 649657) (6) Mills should whole heartedly identify themselves with the boycott of foreign cloth movement and to this end should put forth all their energy towards gaining control over piece goods merchants, other middle men and cotton market in so far as it may be possible.
('41', 342, 1, 5, 649923) (7) If a clear understanding is arrived at with mills, khadi depots will naturally become agencies for the sale of mill cloth under terms laid down by the said committee.
('41', 342, 1, 6, 650094) (8) Mills should hand to the said committee such funds as may be required from time to time for propaganda.
('41', 342, 1, 7, 650202) This, in my opinion, may not exceed one lakh of rupees.
('41', 342, 1, 8, 650258) This letter is being hurriedly dictated.
('41', 342, 1, 9, 650299) You mill therefore please supplement these conditions with those stated in the two issues of Young India 1 if there is any omission.
('41', 342, 1, 10, 650432) You will not publish this letter in any case, and, you will please remember that these are only my own personal views, and if anything substantial is to come out of these talks, [th]ere will have to be a formal meeti[ng of a]ll concerned.

('41', 343, 6, 10, 651363) 395. SATYAGRAHIS, BEWARE!
('41', 343, 7, 11, 651389) When member of the Hunter Committee asked General Dyer the leading question with reference to the Jallianwala Bagh: Was it your idea to instil fear of the Government in the minds of the people by acting ruthlessly? the latter, enthusiastically accepted the suggestion and replied in the affirmative.
('41', 343, 7, 12, 651689) However, the reign of terror had not begun with General Dyer.
('41', 343, 7, 13, 651751) It is the legacy of tradition and the monopoly of Indian bureaucracy.
('41', 343, 7, 14, 651821) It can, however, be said that General Dyer gained notoriety for this repression.
('41', 343, 7, 15, 651902) Hence we know it also as Dyerism.
('41', 343, 7, 16, 651936) As bureaucracy is dependent for its very existence on a policy of Dyerism, it does not hesitate to seek shelter under the latter when occasion arises.
('41', 343, 7, 17, 652087) According to it such an occasion has arisen in Bardoli.
('41', 343, 7, 18, 652143) Hence it may be said to have launched repression on the bania satyagrahis who are regarded as cowardly and submissive.
('41', 343, 7, 19, 652262) Eight of these satyagrahis have been served with notices that if they do not pay up their land revenue stipulated therein before the 12th of April, their lands will be confiscated.
('41', 343, 7, 20, 652443) The notice served on one bania gentleman shows the amount of revenue due as Rs. 160. Perhaps we could not have found fault with the Government if it had confiscated land worth Rs. 160, but to confiscate land worth thousands of rupees for the sake of Rs. 160 is nothing but repression.
('41', 343, 7, 21, 652728) Under this policy,
('41', 344, 0, 1, 652747) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 345
('41', 344, 1, 2, 652789) on certain occasions, the punishment for a slap is not ano ther slap but the gallows.
('41', 344, 1, 3, 652875) We shall call anyone who extorts a thousand rupees for a debt of one rupee a tyrant, a ten headed Ravana.
('41', 344, 1, 4, 652981) What reply will the banias, who are said to have forethought, give to this?
('41', 344, 1, 5, 653057) Will they betray cowardice or prove themselves worthy of having joined the army of satyagrahis?
('41', 344, 1, 6, 653153) Vallabhbhai has warned not once but repeatedly that the Government has by legislation acquired the right to confiscate land, to imprison people, etc., and that it has time and again given proof of the fact that it will not hesitate in the least to exercise those rights.
('41', 344, 1, 7, 653424) Hence neither they nor others should be flabbergasted by this notice of confiscation.
('41', 344, 1, 8, 653510) They should have faith that the Government will not be able to derive any benefit from the land which would be confiscated in this manner and that it would not go to a traitor who would come forward to purchase it if it is auctioned.
('41', 344, 1, 9, 653744) Land which has been filched in this manner is like unprocessed mercury which is bound to erupt as boils.
('41', 344, 1, 10, 653849) Land is not more precious than ones pledge or ones self respect.
('41', 344, 1, 11, 653914) There are myriads of landless people in this country.
('41', 344, 1, 12, 653968) During the last floods, many peoples lands were eroded and layers of sand have now been deposited over them.
('41', 344, 1, 13, 654077) Just as Gujaratis withstood the wrath of the heavens with courage and fortitude, may the satyagrahis of Bardoli similarly put up with this wrath of the Government and may they stand by their pledge!

('41', 344, 2, 15, 654312) 396. THE NATIONAL WEEK
('41', 344, 3, 16, 654335) The forthcoming National Week is the ninth of its kind.
('41', 344, 3, 17, 654391) In this Week, we should take stock of the progress made by us.
('41', 344, 3, 18, 654454) However, instead of that we find despondency in many places.
('41', 344, 3, 19, 654515) For us this Week is the time for calculating the national sum total of achievement, for introspection and for self purification, for uniting the hearts of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and other, for Hindus to welcome in their midst those men and women who have been regarded as untouchables and to serve them, and for Hindus, Muslims and others to take exclusively to khadi and boycott foreign cloth.
('41', 344, 3, 20, 654911) However, today we seem to have forgotten these limbs which
('41', 345, 0, 1, 654970) 346 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 345, 1, 2, 655012) sustain the nation.
('41', 345, 1, 3, 655032) Those who have aith in any of these causes are making efforts to promote them.
('41', 345, 1, 4, 655111) But now all this is not beinng done on an extensive scale.
('41', 345, 1, 5, 655170) Today we do not hear people say, as they used to do in the past, that swaraj cannot be secured without these.
('41', 345, 1, 6, 655280) An attempt should be made during the National Week to bring about a change in this state of affairs.
('41', 345, 1, 7, 655381) Those who have an unswerving faith in constructive activity should make great efforts in this direction, irrespective of whether some or all national institutions make such an effort; it is only from such efforts that an allembracing activity will and must start again.
('41', 345, 1, 8, 655651) None should entertain any doubts that khadi is the one visible activity that can be taken up by children, men, women, Hindus, Muslims and all others.
('41', 345, 1, 9, 655801) The talk of boy cott is everywhere in the air.
('41', 345, 1, 10, 655848) However, there seems to be some confu sion regarding boycott at the moment.
('41', 345, 1, 11, 655924) Some persons advocate the boy cott of British goods, others of British cloth alone and that too until such time as a peaceful solution is arrived at, while yet others advocate the permanent boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 345, 1, 12, 656140) All these things cannot go on at the same time.
('41', 345, 1, 13, 656188) After the first two intentions had been proclaimed for twenty years, the people found on deeper reflection in 1920 that the only way of boycotting foreign cloth which was possible as well as obligatory was to replace it by khadi.
('41', 345, 1, 14, 656418) Moreover, this idea of boycotting foreign cloth does not depend on any conditions but holds good for all time.
('41', 345, 1, 15, 656529) And that which is everlasting is beneficial even in small measure whereas that which is dependent on conditions is beneficial only if it materializes in an appropriate measure.
('41', 345, 1, 16, 656706) If the latter brings bout only partial results, it may even prove harmful.
('41', 345, 1, 17, 656781) Hence we ought to free ourselves from this delusion and make constant efforts to carry on propaganda for khadi for the sake of boycotting foreign cloth or, in other words, for the sake of the poor of India.
('41', 345, 1, 18, 656988) In order to do that : 1. those who do not already wear khadi should do so and advise others to do likewise; 2. all should spin as much as possible and inspire others to do likewise; 3. all should contribute as much as possible for this cause and collect funds from neighbours.
('41', 345, 1, 19, 657265) In this connection, what Shri Vithaldas Jerajani writes is worth

('41', 346, 2, 3, 657384) The figures given here are worth pondering over.
('41', 346, 2, 4, 657433) Bombay is the barometer for gauging the feelings of politically conscious India.
('41', 346, 2, 5, 657514) It is not too great a venture for Bombay to reach the figures of the first year.
('41', 346, 2, 6, 657595) That is like a drop in the ocean in the matter of making the boycott a success.

('41', 346, 4, 9, 657725) ORISSAS PLIGHT I give below an extract 2 from Shri Chhaganlal Gandhis letter: The reader should remember that these starving children who wander about aimlessly, who pick up from the sand and eat banana skins which have been thrown away, are our own brothers and sisters.
('41', 346, 4, 10, 657997) if we proudly call India our mother, we cannot but look upon these forlorn children as our brothers and sisters.
('41', 346, 4, 11, 658110) What can swaraj mean to them?
('41', 346, 4, 12, 658140) What will they say if we ask them to define swaraj?
('41', 346, 4, 13, 658192) Shall we fill their stomaches by throwing uncooked rice at them by way of alms?
('41', 346, 4, 14, 658272) Shall we let them pick up banana skins from the sand?
('41', 346, 4, 15, 658326) Shall we let them eat rotten grain?
('41', 346, 4, 16, 658362) Or shall we make human beings of them by making them industrious and providing them with some occupation?
('41', 346, 4, 17, 658468) In my humble opinion, swaraj lies hidden in the search for a remedy for the starvation in Orissa.
('41', 346, 4, 18, 658566) CHEAP KHADI The person in charge of the Shuddha Khadi Bhandar on Richey Road has sent the following note 3: If we wish to boycott foreign cloth, the stock of khadi lying in this small shop will be sold out on a single day of the week.
('41', 346, 4, 19, 658801) One such shop should not have much difficulty in meeting its expenses.

('41', 347, 3, 5, 659465) Of course the mill owners would gladly give whatever may be wanted if only we would undertake to advertise their wares; but it is not possible for us to do so unless they accept our terms.

('41', 347, 8, 14, 660070) I am sorry indeed that anybody should have mentioned anything to you about my proposed visit to Burma.
('41', 347, 8, 15, 660173) Even if I come to Burma I do not expect any contribution from Burmese.
('41', 347, 8, 16, 660244) If I come I should certainly hesitate to express my views on the political situaion until I had studied it and could speak on it with confidence.

('41', 348, 3, 4, 660596) MY DEAR JAWAHAR, I have your letter.
('41', 348, 3, 5, 660633) The enclosed copies will tell you what progress is being made in the negotiations with the mill owners.
('41', 348, 3, 6, 660737) I however agree with you that nothing will come out of them at the present moment.
('41', 348, 3, 7, 660820) But the negotiations may fructify on due occasion.
('41', 348, 3, 8, 660871) There was a time when the mill owners were absolutely defiant about boycott propaganda.
('41', 348, 3, 9, 660959) I shall write to you after these negotiations are finished.
('41', 348, 3, 10, 661019) Though Romain Rollands first expected letter has arrived and [he] warmly looks [forward] to my proposed visit, it does not enable me to come to a decision.
('41', 348, 3, 11, 661175) As the time for arriving at a fixed decision is drawing nearer, my diffidence is growing.
('41', 348, 3, 12, 661265) There may be however a cable from Rolland next week and it may decide my fate.
('41', 348, 3, 13, 661344) Meanwhile there is no going to Singapur.
('41', 348, 3, 14, 661385) I am fixed up here for the time being.
('41', 348, 3, 15, 661424) If I do not go to Europe, I am due to go to Burma and pass there two months, going to a hill side and making collections during my stay there.
('41', 348, 3, 16, 661567) I am quite of your opinion that some day we shall have to start an intensive movement without the rich people and witout the vocal educated class.
('41', 348, 3, 17, 661714) But that time is not yet.
('41', 348, 3, 18, 661740) You do not tell me where Kamala is to pass the summer months.

('41', 350, 2, 4, 662948) Jeevanlalji of Calcutta requires rest and change.
('41', 350, 2, 5, 662998) He has been advised to go to Bangalore.
('41', 350, 2, 6, 663038) Will you please secure a small bungalow or a flat on monthly terms?
('41', 350, 2, 7, 663106) It should be well lighted, well ventilated and roomy.
('41', 350, 2, 8, 663160) The more isolated it is the better, as it is required for recuperation.
('41', 350, 2, 9, 663232) The sanitary surroundings should be perfectly good.
('41', 350, 2, 10, 663284) If such a bungalow is available, before closing I want you to telegraph to me giving me the situation and terms.
('41', 350, 2, 11, 663397) I would like you to give this matter early attention.

('41', 350, 6, 18, 663772) But I never get the time to write to you.
('41', 350, 6, 19, 663814) I had your telegram also.
('41', 350, 6, 20, 663840) There is the expected letter from Rolland.
('41', 350, 6, 21, 663883) He seems to like the idea of my going and has been already prompting associations to send me invitations.
('41', 350, 6, 22, 663989) But as the time for deciding is nearing, I am growing more and more diffident.
('41', 350, 6, 23, 664068) I am still waiting before coming to a final decision for his expected cable.
('41', 350, 6, 24, 664145) Mr. Mukul Dey is here and began operation immediately he came.

('41', 351, 3, 5, 664633) I fear that it is distance that lends enchantment to the Ashram.
('41', 351, 3, 6, 664698) I do not know that at your age and with your habits already formed you could exchange your comparatively soft life for the comparatively hard life of the Ashram.
('41', 351, 3, 7, 664860) But if you are seriously desirous of being in the Ashram, you should first of all study its constitution and then come and live in it for a few days and see for yourself its life.
('41', 351, 3, 8, 665040) I am sorry I have no copy of the constitution at the present moment.
('41', 351, 3, 9, 665109) But it is reproduced in Natesans publications of my writings and speeches.
('41', 351, 3, 10, 665184) The constitution has undergone alterations but nothing of a substantial nature.
('41', 351, 3, 11, 665264) You will notice in it that it is necessary for the inmate of the Ashram to live the life of a celibate.

('41', 352, 3, 4, 666022) DEAR SATYANANDA BABU, I have your letter.
('41', 352, 3, 5, 666064) It give me joy to think that you do remember me occasionally.
('41', 352, 3, 6, 666126) You will have seen from the pages of Young India that I am trying my best to induce mill owners to shoulder the burden of bringing about a boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 352, 3, 7, 666291) We may not go beyond the negotiations at the present moment.
('41', 352, 3, 8, 666352) But the ground will have been prepared for future action, if we can do nothing just now.
('41', 352, 3, 9, 666441) I am not at all sure in my mind as to the propriety of going to Europe.
('41', 352, 3, 10, 666513) I am therefore still vegetating and still awaiting for the call from within.
('41', 352, 3, 11, 666590) The next fortnight will perhaps decide the matter.
('41', 352, 3, 12, 666641) If, however, the negotiations take a concrete shape, of course I do not go because I flatter myself with the belief that a ssuccessful prosecution of the boycott will demand my continuous presence in India.

('41', 353, 3, 6, 667450) He is perhaps better fitted for the work because his knowledge of English is better and being a Cutchi knows the language and habits of many people there.
('41', 353, 3, 7, 667605) Of course he is a well tried worker.
('41', 353, 3, 8, 667642) He has been working in connection with khadi for many years now and has a wide knowledge of mercantile business.
('41', 353, 3, 9, 667755) He was born and brought up in Malabar.
('41', 353, 3, 10, 667794) He really came with Lakshmidas.
('41', 353, 3, 11, 667826) He has been just now taken up by Kakasaheb for the Vidyapith in order to develop the charkha work.
('41', 353, 3, 12, 667925) Therefore he is loaned to you from the Vidyapith and his honoranium will be paid by the Vidyapith.
('41', 353, 3, 13, 668024) His travelling expenses are being paid just now on your account, that is, the Committees account, but if there is any difficulty about paying his railway expenses, you will please tell me.
('41', 353, 3, 14, 668213) I take it that you wont want to keep him beyond 15th of May.
('41', 353, 3, 15, 668274) If you do want anybody beyond that time, I will have to send you someone else because he will be wanted by Kakasaheb on the first of June and before that he would want to go to Calicut to bring his family.
('41', 353, 3, 16, 668480) About your own honorarium, I have now a letter from Thakkar Bapu who says you old him also that you would want no more than Rs. 150. What is this?
('41', 353, 3, 17, 668627) I do not mind the Rs. 200, but I want to know how you came upon Rs. 150 and why afterwards you had to increase your demand?
('41', 353, 3, 18, 668751) I am anxious for all of us to be deliberate and firm in all we do.
('41', 353, 3, 19, 668818) The only hope I see of our regeneration lies in some at least developing decision, forethought and the like.
('41', 353, 3, 20, 668927) You are not to take this amiss, nor to revert to Rs. 150 unless you can clearly do so whilst you are doing relief work.
('41', 353, 3, 21, 669047) But if you find that you made a miscalculation or if you fixed Rs. 150 without previous consultation with Mrs. Malkani and others concerned, you must humbly make the admission and ask for Rs. 200. You understand why I write all this, dont you?
('41', 353, 3, 22, 669291) I want you to come up to my expectations.
('41', 353, 4, 23, 669333) Yours sincerely, BAPU SJT.

('41', 354, 2, 3, 669507) MY DEAR RAJAN, You have put me a very difficult question.
('41', 354, 2, 4, 669565) But after giving very careful consideration to the whole of your argument, I incline towards your accepting an honorarium for whole time work in connection with the Fellowship.
('41', 354, 2, 5, 669742) You will not be able to put your whole soul into it if your attention is divided between two trusts.
('41', 354, 2, 6, 669843) One or the other or both must suffer, especially when there is likely often to be a conflict between the two.
('41', 354, 2, 7, 669953) On the pinciple that the labourer is worthy of his hire, I see no ethical objection against your accepting an honorarium for your work for the Fellowship.

('41', 355, 2, 3, 670628) SATYAGRAHA ASHRAM, SABARMATI, April 4, 1928 I wish New India many years of useful service to the country.
('41', 355, 2, 4, 670734) May its revival hasten the advent of swaraj.
('41', 355, 3, 5, 670779) 413. PRAYER SPEECH AT ASHRAM [April 4, 1928] 1
('41', 355, 4, 6, 670826) The first lesson in emulating Hanuman is to apply all ones senses to the task in hand.
('41', 355, 4, 7, 670913) In order to do this, ones vision must remain unwavering and pure.
('41', 355, 4, 8, 670979) The eyes are the lamp of the body and, one may add, of the soul also.
('41', 355, 4, 9, 671049) For inasmuch as the soul dwells in the body, it can be looked at through the eyes.
('41', 355, 4, 10, 671132) A man might through his speech present a false show and deceive others, but his eyes would reveal him.
('41', 355, 4, 11, 671235) If he does not have a steady unwavering look in his eyes, his real nature will be betrayed.
('41', 355, 4, 12, 671327) Just as physical ailments are diagnosed by examining the tongue, spiritual maladies may be detected by looking at the eyes.
('41', 355, 4, 13, 671451) Hence children should be taught to look straight, right from their childhood.
('41', 355, 4, 14, 671529) Hanumans eyes had a steadfast gaze and showed that, just as Ramas name was ever on his lips, it filled his heart and pervaded every fibre of his being.
('41', 355, 4, 15, 671681) I like the custom of installing Hanuman in our gymnasiums; this however does not mean that we wish to gain physical strength alone or that we worship merely Hanumans physical strength.
('41', 355, 4, 16, 671866) We should certainly become physically strong; but we should also know that Hanuman did not have the physique of a giant, he was the son of Vayu 2, hence his body was as light as a flower and yet wiry.
('41', 355, 4, 17, 672067) However, Hanumans distinctiveness lay not in his physical strength but in his devotion.
('41', 355, 4, 18, 672155) He was an incomparable devotee and servant of Rama.
('41', 355, 4, 19, 672207) He found fulfilment in serving Rama like a slave and he performed with the speed of wind whatever service was asked of him.
('41', 355, 4, 20, 672331) We therefore worship Hanuman and instal him in gymnasiums because though we
('41', 355, 5, 21, 672407) 1 According to Prajabandhu the speech was made on April 4 in connection with Hanuman Jayanti.

('41', 356, 1, 2, 672554) do physical exercise we are going to become servantsservants of India, servants of the world and, through these means, servants of God.
('41', 356, 1, 3, 672690) It is through this humble service that we shall catch a glimpse of God.
('41', 356, 1, 4, 672762) Hence we should not even say that we worship Hanuman only for his brahmacharya.
('41', 356, 1, 5, 672842) Every servant has to practise brahmacharya; how can anyone who has taken the vow of service enjoy the pleasures of sense?
('41', 356, 1, 6, 672964) It is necessary for one to practise self control even to render the limited service to ones parents; it cannot be rendered if anyone yields to his passions as I did.
('41', 356, 1, 7, 673130) Similarly, how can anyone who would serve the Ashram, serve men and women, boys and girls, how can he afford to gratify his sensual desires?
('41', 356, 1, 8, 673271) And serving the Ashram is such a small matter; it is like a drop in the ocean.
('41', 356, 1, 9, 673350) Hence anyone who would serve the world should flee his desires.
('41', 356, 1, 10, 673414) However, mere fasting and penance are not sufficient to keep away from pleasures of sense; this can be achieved through a Hanuman like devotion.
('41', 356, 1, 11, 673559) Hence the key to brahmacharya and all other virtues is found in single minded devotion.
('41', 356, 1, 12, 673647) Every evening we recite :
('41', 356, 3, 13, 673673) The senses of him who fasts may well be quietened,but this does not help in controlling the desire for gratifying the passions; the mind very often becomes more restless when the senses become weak; then the mind runs more after the objects of pleasure; that too is calmed by the vision of Rama.
('41', 356, 3, 14, 673969) This is the message of Hanuman, the lesson to be learnt from his life.
('41', 356, 3, 15, 674040) Yesterday I used an adjective which I had never used previously to qualify brahmacharya.
('41', 356, 3, 16, 674129) I said that Hanumans brahmacharya was sattvik, and, while praising brahmacharya, I mentioned three distinct types of itsattvik, rajasik and tamasik.
('41', 356, 3, 17, 674278) Whereas Hanumans brahmacharya was of a sattvik nature, Meghnads was rajasik.
('41', 356, 3, 18, 674355) One who practises the latter type of brahmacharya has anger and pride.
('41', 356, 3, 19, 674426) Total surrender is the mark of the sattvik type.
('41', 356, 3, 20, 674475) It cannot be said that either of these two was inferior to the other in physical strength.
('41', 356, 3, 21, 674566) Hanuman however could defeat Meghnad becaue the latter was full of pride, while Hanuman was full of devotion and so possessed additional
('41', 356, 4, 22, 674703) 1 When a man starves his senses, the objects of those senses disappear from him, but not the yearning for them; the yearning too departs when he beholds the Supreme.

('41', 357, 1, 3, 674940) We should, therefore, keep our vision pure, our hands and feet pure and our speech pure and, by doing so, develop the capacity to imitate Hanuman to some extent.
('41', 357, 1, 4, 675102) We certainly wish to improve our physique by practising brahmacharya, but the under lying motive is that we wish to become devotees of Rama even through the means of our body and thereby serve the world.
('41', 357, 1, 5, 675306) It is not that if we took care of the outer the inner would automatically take care of itself.
('41', 357, 1, 6, 675401) However, if we keep on taking care of the physical side and if this is not a mere veneer, the mind too will one day become steadfast and only then shall we be as good as Hanuman.

('41', 357, 4, 9, 675647) Within two days of the publication of this issue, the National Week will be on us.
('41', 357, 4, 10, 675730) We used at one time, in the process of self purification, to picket liquor dens.
('41', 357, 4, 11, 675811) I am reminded of those days as I go through the following paragraph from an address received from the members of the Coimbatore Adi Dravida Association : 1
('41', 357, 5, 12, 675967) The old order has not changed even to a small extent, and even our souls are despised by the other Hindus so that we are not allowed to worship in temples the one God.
('41', 357, 5, 13, 676135) The churches and mosques have their doors wide open to receive us and the missionaries in charge of them extend us a hearty welcome.
('41', 357, 5, 14, 676268) The Government tempts our young men by locating liquor shops in or near our cheries, the living quarters of our community.
('41', 357, 5, 15, 676391) If industrial institutions took the place of such shops and if social workers befriended us instead of abkari contractors, we have no doubt that our progress would be assured in a very short time.
('41', 357, 5, 16, 676588) We, therefore, earnestly appeal to you for help to organize industrial schools in or near our living quarters to save our community from ruin.
('41', 357, 5, 17, 676731) We need not consider during the National Week what the Government has done or not done, but we are bound to consider what we have done and what we can do.
('41', 357, 5, 18, 676886) Whilst there is no doubt that public opinion against untouchability has been strengthening day by day, public action still remains weak.
('41', 357, 5, 19, 677023) We have not even been able to induce the keepers of public temples to throw their doors open to the

('41', 358, 3, 5, 677511) With reference to my note in Young India 1 of 22nd March last about the treatment of Kolis in Baghat State, president of the Arya Samaj, New Delhi, writes : 2
('41', 358, 4, 6, 677670) The president is no other than Rai Saheb Lala Ganga Ram, the well known philanthropist and public worker of Delhi.
('41', 358, 4, 7, 677785) Lala Ganga Rams letter seems to leave little doubt about the correctness of the allegations made in the previous letter published in these pages.
('41', 358, 4, 8, 677931) I had hoped that his informants had exaggerated the happenings in Baghat State and that it had not treated as a crime the wearing of the sacred thread by the so called untouchables.
('41', 358, 4, 9, 678113) I have before me a copy of the letter written to Lala Ganga Ram by the Prime Minister of the State.
('41', 358, 4, 10, 678213) It runs :
('41', 358, 5, 11, 678223) In reply to your letter dated the 10th January 1928, I regret that the State is unable to supply you the copy of the judgment, as Arya Samaj is not a party to this suit.
('41', 358, 5, 12, 678393) I cannot help remarking that the reply is in extremely bad taste.
('41', 358, 5, 13, 678459) It is a bad copy of some English officials laconic and stereotyped replies which they ordinarily send to correspondents who ask inconvenient questions.
('41', 358, 5, 14, 678611) But these estimable gentlemen as a rule respect rank and status and do not crudely invent things to suit their replies.
('41', 358, 5, 15, 678731) The Prime Minister of Baghat State has dared to ignore Lala Ganga Rams status in society (I mean apart from his title) and for the sake of insulting him has imagined what Lala Ganga Ram has never said in his letter.
('41', 358, 5, 16, 678947) For the never asked for a copy of the judgment in the case nor claimed to be party in the case against the unfortunate Kolis.
('41', 358, 5, 17, 679073) This is essentially matter for the Hindu Mahasabha to take up.
('41', 358, 5, 18, 679136) I do not know whether the Sabha countenances the wearing of the sacred thread by the so called untouchables.
('41', 358, 5, 19, 679245) Whether it does or not, it cannot possibly approve of coercion being used against those who choose to wear it.
('41', 358, 5, 20, 679356) Immediately the thread becomes a monopoly

('41', 359, 4, 7, 679836) The All India Spinners Association has issued its second annual report.
('41', 359, 4, 8, 679908) It is a thoroughly businesslike and instructive document.
('41', 359, 4, 9, 679966) The letterpress occupies 31 octavo pages.
('41', 359, 4, 10, 680008) The appendices occupy 24 pages.
('41', 359, 4, 11, 680040) If I may advise the reader, I would suggest his reading the appendices first.
('41', 359, 4, 12, 680118) They will give him a detailed analysis of the income and the expenditure of the Association duly audited and certified.
('41', 359, 4, 13, 680238) He will discover at a glance how over 20 lakhs of rupees have been laid out for the promotion of the greatest, because the most extensive, national industry.
('41', 359, 4, 14, 680396) If he will study the figures carefully, he will perceive the value of investing a portion of his income in this industry, and the return he would get for his investment would be the prosperity of the poor villagers on whose toil his own income depends.
('41', 359, 4, 15, 680649) Among the appendices he will find also the resolutions of the All India Spinners Association defining its general policy, conditions on which loans are granted, conditions on which credit sales may be conducted by its depots and on which bounties are given to private khadi dealers and commissions to khadi hawkers.
('41', 359, 4, 16, 680965) He will also find in them the constitution of the All India Spinners Association, the names and locations of different agencies and other information of value.
('41', 359, 4, 17, 681125) Having glanced through the appendices, let him go through the report if he has a half hour or an hour to spare and he will know the way khadi has progressed.
('41', 359, 4, 18, 681283) He will know the condition of the All India Deshbandu Memorial Fund.
('41', 359, 4, 19, 681352) Whereas the total production during 1925 26 was Rs. 23,76,670, in 1926 27 it was Rs. 24,06,370 and the sales during the same period were Rs. 28,99,143 and Rs. 33,48,794, respectively.
('41', 359, 4, 20, 681536) Investors in khadi may therefore derive comfort that khadi is not a losing but a substantially progressive proposition.
('41', 359, 4, 21, 681656) As against 50,000 spinners according to the previous report, there were 83,339 serving 5,193 weavers during the year under report.
('41', 359, 4, 22, 681787) As against

('41', 360, 1, 2, 681840) 1,500 villages, now there are 2,381 villages where hand spinning is done through the agency of the Association.
('41', 360, 1, 3, 681952) And just as the figures about spinners and villages were understated in the last report, so are they under estimated in the report under notice.
('41', 360, 1, 4, 682097) There are 177 khadi production centres of which 62 are departmental, 41 aided and 74 independent.
('41', 360, 1, 5, 682195) There are 204 centres of which 115 are departmental, 44 aided and 45 independent, and the total number of workers under the direct control of the Central Office and in aided organizations is 748. This does not include those working in the independent organiz ations.
('41', 360, 1, 6, 682462) Of improvement in the quality of yarn the report states : 1
('41', 360, 2, 7, 682522) It is satisfactory to note that whilst there is improvement in the quality, the prices have undergone steady reduction.
('41', 360, 2, 8, 682642) The following information about the special khadi service furnished by the Technical Department will be read with interest : 2
('41', 360, 3, 9, 682769) I must skip over the other instructive paragraphs of the report.
('41', 360, 3, 10, 682834) I hope I have given sufficient information to what the appetite of the reader for possessing the report itself which can be had at the office of the All India Spinners Association, Mirzapur, Ahmedabad, for 4 annas worth of postage stamps.

('41', 361, 1, 7, 683839) The grateful Indians have not been slow to discover and appreciate the worth of this distinguished countryman and they were urging him to prolong his stay, if it was at all possible.
('41', 361, 1, 8, 684022) Let them now demonstrate their affection and appreciation by becoming united and by being correct in the observance of all their part of the agreement.

('41', 361, 3, 14, 684357) An Ahmedabad mill owner writes: 1
('41', 361, 4, 15, 684391) The letter is refreshingly candid.
('41', 361, 4, 16, 684426) I wish that the other mill owners would take the view that this correspondent takes of the possibility of standardization of prices and necessarily therefore of cloth.
('41', 361, 4, 17, 684594) It is refreshing too to find that fluctuations of cotton prices do not much affect prices of cloth.
('41', 361, 4, 18, 684694) And I would add in spite of the correspondents view to the contrary that it is possible to control cotton prices if it is possible for us to boycott foreign cloth.
('41', 361, 4, 19, 684858) For prices of our cotton are dominated by America only because we export large quantities of cotton and that too to the market for which America also caters.
('41', 361, 4, 20, 685016) If we consider it to be possible, as it has proved to be possible, to appeal successfully to the patriotism of the buyer of cloth it is equally possible to make a successful appeal to that of the grower of cotton.
('41', 361, 4, 21, 685230) Indeed the importance of foreign cloth boycott is derived from the knowledge that for it to succeed all the component parts of the nation have voluntarily to join the movement.
('41', 361, 4, 22, 685407) It cannot succeed
('41', 361, 5, 23, 685425) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('41', 362, 0, 1, 685462) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 363
('41', 362, 1, 2, 685504) unless there is willing and hearty co operation from the vast mass of the village population.
('41', 362, 1, 3, 685598) My faith in the movement persists because I know the masses to be sound.
('41', 362, 1, 4, 685671) Only the classes block the way because of their want of faith.
('41', 362, 1, 5, 685734) If they will only shed their fear and their unbelief and lead the movement, the masses will follow.
('41', 362, 1, 6, 685834) And this boycott is the only thing in which it is possible for the masses actively to join without having to make much sacrifice.
('41', 362, 1, 7, 685964) I do not share the view of the correspondent that artificail silk may be used with impunity in the manufacture of cloth in our mills.
('41', 362, 1, 8, 686098) His com parison of foreign dyes and foreign size with artificial silk is hastily made.
('41', 362, 1, 9, 686185) Just now we contemplate boycott only of foreign cloth, not of dyes and size.
('41', 362, 1, 10, 686262) All foreign yarns therefore, whether silk, wool or cotton, nautral or artificial, must be taboo; or if foreign artificial silk yarn may be used with impunity why not foreign cotton or wool or natural silk yarn?
('41', 362, 1, 11, 686473) But with foreign cotton it is a different thing.
('41', 362, 1, 12, 686522) We need not exclude from use foreign cotton, for it is a raw product.
('41', 362, 1, 13, 686592) What we must boycott for the sake of the starving masses living in enforced idleness for at least four months in the year is foreign yarn and cloth which the masses can spin and weave in their cottages.
('41', 362, 1, 14, 686795) The indigenous mill cloth too would be intolerable if it displaced these mases without finding for them an equivalent industry.
('41', 362, 1, 15, 686923) The mills have a place in the economy of national life only to the extent that they supplement the national industry of handspinning in millions of our cottages.
('41', 362, 1, 16, 687085) They will be a hindrance if they compete with them and supplant them.
('41', 362, 1, 17, 687155) Their natural tendency no doubt is to supplant both the village spinner and the village weaver.
('41', 362, 1, 18, 687251) It is only when the mill owners, mill agents and their share holders become truly national and conduct their affairs not to exploit the masses but for their benefit first and their own profits after, that they will be able to appreciate and not merely to join but of lead the boycott movement.
('41', 362, 1, 19, 687545) That, if they take a long view of the matter, they have nothing to lose and much to gain has been made clear by the foregoing letter.
('41', 362, 1, 20, 687679) Indeed it is a self evident proposition.
('41', 362, 1, 21, 687720) Boycott of foreign cloth, if it is the best assurance of steady work for the masses, is also an equal assurance to the mills of steady profits in the long run.
('41', 362, 1, 22, 687880) But the history of the mill industry at least during the past seven years of the mass movement does not fill one with much hope of the
('41', 363, 0, 1, 688015) 364 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 363, 1, 2, 688057) mills rising to the occasion and realizing their duty to the nation.
('41', 363, 1, 3, 688126) Instead of looking upon khadi with favour and fostering it, our mills have entered into an unfair, unpartriotic and illegitimate competition with khadi.
('41', 363, 1, 4, 688279) The following are the figures of khadi manufactured by our mills during the respective years : 1925 1926 1927 Lb.
('41', 363, 1, 5, 688393) 2,28,87,970 2,72,36,337 3,39,77,851 Yards 6,50,48,487 7,43,13,280 9,43,80,368 They have sold this enormous quantity of coarse cloth as khadi and have not hesitated in some cases shamelessly to use the charkha label, etc., with the deliberate purpose of exploiting the khadi atmos phere created by Congreass organizations.
('41', 363, 1, 6, 688715) It gives one pain to have to say that the mills that thus manufactured coarse cloth and palmed it off as khadi did a distinct disservice to the nation.
('41', 363, 1, 7, 688867) If their eyes are now opened and if only to do belated reparation for the grave wrong done by them to the nation, they will head or at least join the boycott movement on the terms suggested by me or others equally effective.
('41', 363, 1, 8, 689092) This painful discovery of the figures has however a bright side to it.
('41', 363, 1, 9, 689163) It is a revelation even to an optimist and khadi expert like The Ashramme of the hold that khadi has acquired over the people.
('41', 363, 1, 10, 689290) It shows that a much larger number that we are aware of has in obedience to the nations call changed their taste and preferred to buy and use coarse cloth instead of the fine cloth they used to wear before.
('41', 363, 1, 11, 689497) They have undoubtedly often paid higher prices than they used to.
('41', 363, 1, 12, 689563) They have bought mill khadi largely under the mistaken belief that it was genuine and that it had the imprimatur of the Congress.
('41', 363, 1, 13, 689693) An ardent lover of the mases has in these figures and my legitimate deductions therefrom much food for thought and equal cause for hope.
('41', 363, 1, 14, 689830) As for my feared visit to Europe, I may assure the correspondent that I do not propose to visit Europe if an effective scheme of boycott materializes in the very near future.

('41', 364, 1, 2, 690069) 419. NOTES
('41', 364, 2, 3, 690080) AFRICANS AND INDIANS Deenabandhu Andrews, when he was here recently, drew my attention to what the Poet had written in the Press in connection with a movement in the Transvaal said to be going on on behalf of Indians to isolate themselves from the Africans and wanted me to give my opinion on it.
('41', 364, 2, 4, 690377) I do not think that any importance need be attached to the alleged movement.
('41', 364, 2, 5, 690454) For I feel that it has no bottom.
('41', 364, 2, 6, 690488) Indians have too much in common with the Africans to think of isolating themselves from them.
('41', 364, 2, 7, 690582) They cannot exist in South Africa for any length of time without the active sympathy and friendship of the Africans.
('41', 364, 2, 8, 690699) I am not aware of the general body of the Indians having ever adopted an air of superiority towards their African brethren, and it would be a tragedy if any such movement were to gain ground among the Indian settlers of South Africa.
('41', 364, 2, 9, 690933) Needless to say, I entirely associate myself with the opinion so forcibly expressed by the Poet condemning the movement.
('41', 364, 2, 10, 691054) If, as has been stated on behalf of the leaders of the socalled movement, It is humiliating to the Indian sentiment and to the Indian national honour and civilization to think that our Agent General is trying to bring us down to such a low level, it will ill befit us to repudiate such a sentiment when it is expressed by the South African whites in respect ouselves.
('41', 364, 2, 11, 691422) And what is more, the South African whites are able to translate their contempt The Ashramand prejudice against us into action whereas ours towards the South Africans can only react against ourselves.
('41', 364, 3, 12, 691623) WOMEN AND JEWELS A lady doctor in Tamil Nadu sends a letter accompanying her gift referred to in it.
('41', 364, 3, 13, 691724) As the letter, in my opinion, enhances the value of the gift and is likely to serve as an example to others, I compress its contents as follows, omitting the names of the donor, the Raja and the place :
('41', 364, 4, 14, 691927) Just a few lines to tell you that I sent you yesterday a parcel of diamond ring and a pair of ear rings which were given to me about 12 years ago in remembrance of service in the palace.
('41', 364, 4, 15, 692114) when the heir was born to the Raja.
('41', 364, 4, 16, 692150) It grieved me much when I came to know that the Raja did not have even the courage to invite you to his palace when you passed by and I was told that it was due to fear of the Government.
('41', 364, 4, 17, 692338) You can imagine my feeling when after your visit I looked at these jewels which before used to travel with me.
('41', 365, 0, 1, 692449) 366 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 365, 1, 2, 692491) when I looked at them, bitterness rose in my breast and then it turned into deep sympathy for the starving millions about whom you spoke when you were here.
('41', 365, 1, 3, 692648) I said to myself, Are not these jewels made out of the peoples money?
('41', 365, 1, 4, 692718) And, what claim have I to keep them as my own? I then made up my mind to send them on to you.
('41', 365, 1, 5, 692812) You could use them for khadi service and so help some of the starving millions.
('41', 365, 1, 6, 692892) I feel sure that it is a better use to make of them than that they should remain in a corner of my box.
('41', 365, 1, 7, 692996) A friend has valued them at Rs. 500. They are therefore insured for that amount.
('41', 365, 1, 8, 693077) I only hope that some generous person will give you more than the actual price, knowing the circumstancs in which these things are being sent to you.
('41', 365, 1, 9, 693227) You may make what use you like of this letter.
('41', 365, 1, 10, 693274) It is remarkable how we imagine fears even when there is no cause.
('41', 365, 1, 11, 693341) There are many Rajas who have openly and willingly supported khadi and therethrough the cause of the poor from whom, after all, as my correspondent correctly puts it, they derive their riches.
('41', 365, 1, 12, 693534) It is true that khadi has a political significance; but we have not yet come to the stage when support of khadi can be safely declared by the Government to be criminal.
('41', 365, 1, 13, 693703) Every philanthropic movement can be truned to political use, but it would be a sad day when on that account it is boycotted even as to its philanthropic aspect.
('41', 365, 1, 14, 693864) But it is only fair to state that the Raja to whom reference has been made by the lady doctor is not the only one who is afraid of supporting khadi or showing ordinary courtesy to a public servant like me.
('41', 365, 1, 15, 694070) It is well The Ashramhowever that the Rajas boycott of me has stimulated the gift.
('41', 365, 1, 16, 694153) But I would like all the sisters who may chance to see this note to realize that it is not necessary to be able to emulate the fair donor to have occasions like the one that set her athinking about her duty to the starving millions.
('41', 365, 1, 17, 694386) Surely it is easy enough to realize that so long as there are millions of men and women in the country starving for want of food because of want of work, the sisters have no warrant for possessing costly jewels for adorning their bodies or often for the mere satisfaction of possessing them.
('41', 365, 1, 18, 694678) As I have remarked before now in these pages, if only the rich ladies of India will discard their superfluities and be satisfied with such decoration as khadi can give them it is possible to finance the whole of the khadi movement, not to take into consideration the tremendous moral effect that such a step on the part of the rich daughters of India will produce upon the nation and particularly the starving masses.

('41', 366, 2, 4, 695207) V. M. Joshi, President of Karve Jubilee Committee : 1
('41', 366, 3, 5, 695261) Professor Karve is not an ordinary man who is satisfied if he satisfies an indulgent public which, if it proves itself exacting and imperious at times, issues a certificate of merit ninety nine times out of hundred if some little service is rendered to it during recreation hours.
('41', 366, 3, 6, 695542) Karve has obeyed a master that is never generous, never indulgent and ever exacting, though invariably just.
('41', 366, 3, 7, 695651) This master is his own conscience.
('41', 366, 3, 8, 695686) His self effacement, his single minded devotion to duty, his exhaustless energy, his honesty in all circumstances, his faith in the midst of opposition, his irrepressible optimism are a national asset of the first magnitude.
('41', 366, 3, 9, 695911) There may be two opinion about the work to which he has devoted his great gifts but there can be only one opinion about the gifts themselves.
('41', 366, 3, 10, 696053) And the latter are any day far more valuable and lasting than the work itself.
('41', 366, 3, 11, 696132) The organizers of the Jubilee have set before themselves a very modest task to collect Rs. 25,000 to be presented to Prof.
('41', 366, 3, 12, 696255) Karve for his work.
('41', 366, 3, 13, 696275) It is a sum that should readily come forth from the numerous men and women who have come under the influence of this giant among silent and selfless workers or who have profited by his labours of a lifetime.

('41', 370, 3, 4, 699941) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 370, 3, 5, 699974) If human relations were regulated according to rules of arithmetic, what you propose would be suitable.
('41', 370, 3, 6, 700078) But just as pressing 30 meals into 10 will not be the same as taking the 30 meals regularly from to day, similarly will 6 months spinning compressed into 15 days not do.
('41', 370, 3, 7, 700248) The idea is to test ones powers of sustenance and discipline.
('41', 370, 3, 8, 700310) Nor will it be enough for you to offer saytagraha against your parents and wrest an unwilling consent from them.
('41', 370, 3, 9, 700423) You must get that consent by diligence and force of character.
('41', 370, 4, 10, 700486) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 370, 6, 14, 700756) I shall await the books you promise.
('41', 370, 6, 15, 700793) You say that if a drum is introduced an engine would be nece ssary.
('41', 370, 6, 16, 700861) But I understood from the American friend of whom I spoke to you that the drum could be worked with man power or even animal power without difficulty and with little expense.
('41', 370, 6, 17, 701036) And do you think that a drum is necessary for the development of the little tannery?
('41', 370, 7, 18, 701121) Yours sincerely, Y. R. GAITONDE, ESQ.

('41', 371, 3, 4, 701327) DEAR FRIEND, You will notice I have again returned to the subject of the Kolis in the Baghat State.
('41', 371, 3, 5, 701427) 1 It is a shocking thing.
('41', 371, 3, 6, 701453) When I received your first communication, I had no idea that my correspondent was my old friend the Rai Saheb.
('41', 371, 3, 7, 701564) When, therefore, I made the discovery, it gave me pleasure.
('41', 371, 3, 8, 701624) Who is this Dewan and what is the position of the Baghat State?
('41', 371, 3, 9, 701688) What is its population?
('41', 371, 3, 10, 701712) Is there any public opinion?
('41', 371, 3, 11, 701741) How is the State reached?
('41', 371, 3, 12, 701767) Have the Kolis given up the thread out of fright?

('41', 371, 8, 18, 702009) Nothing is yet certainaboutt he proposed European visit.
('41', 371, 8, 19, 702066) It is difficult for me to make up my mind.
('41', 371, 8, 20, 702109) As to the article you want, I would ask you to take pity on me.
('41', 371, 8, 21, 702173) I am so thoroughly washed out and have to give so much time to Young India and Navajivan that I have very little left for managing any more writing.

('41', 372, 3, 4, 702597) DEAR FRIEND, I have your two letters for which I thank you.
('41', 372, 3, 5, 702657) I have been so busy that it has not been possible for me to overtake your book.
('41', 372, 3, 6, 702737) As to Miss Mayos performance, there is no argument left for me to advance, if you think that ther is no distinction between my writting in Young India and Miss Mayos book.
('41', 372, 3, 7, 702909) If your experience of India coincides with with Miss Mayos, no argument can possibly convince you to the contrary.

('41', 373, 4, 5, 703517) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 373, 4, 6, 703550) I do not perform any miracles nor do I believe in miracles.
('41', 373, 4, 7, 703610) I would advise you to be content with what God gives you bearing in mind that there are many who are in a worse plight than you are.
('41', 373, 4, 8, 703743) And, after all, physical blindness is not half as bad as moral blindness.
('41', 373, 4, 9, 703817) And, whilst we have no positive control over physical infirmities, we have over the moral infirmities.
('41', 373, 4, 10, 703920) If, therefore, there is any such thing as miracle, it should be attempted after ones moral welfare.

('41', 374, 3, 5, 704254) I did not need your budget.
('41', 374, 3, 6, 704282) I must not ask you to cancel your policy.
('41', 374, 3, 7, 704324) I simply passed on to you what was burdening my mind.
('41', 374, 3, 8, 704378) My inquiries must not oppress you.
('41', 374, 3, 9, 704413) We all must try to look as we are.
('41', 374, 3, 10, 704448) And if we could do that we would not worry over any questions.
('41', 374, 3, 11, 704511) The Rs. 200 I shall find and that without any loss of self respect.
('41', 374, 3, 12, 704579) But you must always let me have the privilege of expecting the highest from you.
('41', 374, 3, 13, 704660) Why should you worry about dowries?
('41', 374, 3, 14, 704696) You are going to pay not a farthing.
('41', 374, 3, 15, 704733) Why should the daughters be married in an Amil family necessarily?
('41', 374, 3, 16, 704800) You must train the girls from now to forget that they belong to a caste.
('41', 374, 3, 17, 704873) They belong to India and if you believe in my view of varnashrama, the matter becomes simple.
('41', 374, 3, 18, 704967) Of course you do not need to pay him anything beyond his, say, fare and food there.

('41', 376, 3, 6, 706079) ANSARI, I have your letter.
('41', 376, 3, 7, 706107) I resign myself to your letter to the Viceroy.
('41', 376, 3, 8, 706154) Of course I entirely agree with you that if the States will give us assistance we shall receive it gladly.
('41', 376, 3, 9, 706261) But I know that they dare not give it to an institution that is frankly a creation of non co operation and nursed in its atmosphere.
('41', 376, 3, 10, 706394) But if they do with the certain knowledge that it is a non co operationg institution, we should gladly accept their assistance.
('41', 376, 3, 11, 706522) The proposed European visit is causing me much trouble just now.
('41', 376, 3, 12, 706587) I cant make up my mind.
('41', 376, 3, 13, 706611) I know that I should not be so undecided like this.
('41', 376, 3, 14, 706663) But what is the use of my hiding my weakness?
('41', 376, 3, 15, 706709) I cant account for it myself.
('41', 376, 3, 16, 706739) However, I should come to a decision in the course of the next frotnight at the latest.
('41', 376, 3, 17, 706827) Improvement in health has no attraction for me.
('41', 376, 3, 18, 706875) The meeting with M. Romain Rolland and a quiet conference with the chief men of Europe is what would take me to Eruope.
('41', 376, 3, 19, 706995) Let us see how God leads me.
('41', 376, 3, 20, 707024) What is the use of Begum Ansari and Zohra wanting me to stay in their new abode?
('41', 376, 3, 21, 707105) All the time I am there, they keep themselves at a safe distance hiding themselves behind the purdah.
('41', 376, 3, 22, 707207) If they want me to be there, they will have to expose to view their superfluous bangles and other jewellery so that I can ease them of the superfluities and turn them to good account.
('41', 376, 3, 23, 707391) So far as the Jamia collections are concerned, I suspect that we shall do nothing beyond getting collections from personal friends, and, in order that this can be done it is necessary to have that constitution and trust deed.
('41', 376, 3, 24, 707617) Do please therefore expedite it as soon as you can.

('41', 380, 3, 4, 710517) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 380, 3, 5, 710550) I would love to take up your sister.
('41', 380, 3, 6, 710587) But I doubt whether she would be able to stand the rigorous life of the Ashram.
('41', 380, 3, 7, 710667) We have very little room at present.
('41', 380, 3, 8, 710704) If, therefore, she coms, she will have to share a room with some sister or sisters.
('41', 380, 3, 9, 710788) Then she will have to take part in the Ashram labours.

('41', 381, 3, 4, 711702) MY DEAR PROFESSOR, You know perhaps that Krishnadas is not here at present.
('41', 381, 3, 5, 711778) He has however sent me your letter of the 25 March.
('41', 381, 3, 6, 711830) Why do you say that the Spinners Register will mean purchasing yarn from cottage to cottage?
('41', 381, 3, 7, 711923) I have not suggested any such thing at all.
('41', 381, 3, 8, 711967) 1 What I have suggested is that we should know the spinners with whom the middle men deal.
('41', 381, 3, 9, 712058) We do not want to do away with the middle men altogether.
('41', 381, 3, 10, 712116) We must not be at their mercy either, nor must we be in the dark as to what is actually paid to the spinners.
('41', 381, 3, 11, 712226) The Register, therefore, has to be taken periodically.
('41', 381, 3, 12, 712281) Once we know who the spinners are, where they are, what they get and what they do, you need not bother about them again, say for six months.
('41', 381, 3, 13, 712422) As a matter of fact there should be no difficulty in your coming in touch with the middle men themselves The Ashramand with the spinners through them.
('41', 381, 3, 14, 712573) I dont know whether I am even now clear.
('41', 381, 3, 15, 712614) Not knowing the practical working of these, there may be difficulties of which I have no knowledge.
('41', 381, 3, 16, 712714) You will then write to me about those difficulties and I might be able to make concrete suggestions for overcoming them.
('41', 381, 3, 17, 712835) About the want of capital, I am going to confer with Jamnalalji and Shankerlal.
('41', 381, 3, 18, 712915) You do not say definitely how much you require.
('41', 381, 3, 19, 712963) Is Babu Shivaprasad Gupta ready to advance that sum without interest if repayment is guaranteed and if he is, what will be the period of such loan?
('41', 381, 3, 20, 713111) The last paragraph of your letter is bad.
('41', 381, 3, 21, 713153) You cant afford to give way to despair under any circumstances.
('41', 381, 3, 22, 713217) You have to hold on to the Ashram no matter what difficulties face you.
('41', 381, 3, 23, 713289) You dare not take up any other work.

('41', 382, 5, 8, 713890) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, April 8, 1928
('41', 382, 6, 9, 713927) MY DEAR JAWAHAR, I have your letter.
('41', 382, 6, 10, 713964) I do not remember Father having told me that he would be back in Bombay to confer with the mill owners during the last week of this month.
('41', 382, 6, 11, 714103) But he and I discussed the question of foreign cloth boycott at length and he had a conference with Seth Lalji, Shantikumar, Seths Ambalal, Kasturbhai and Mangaldas.
('41', 382, 6, 12, 714269) It was a good conference, but nothing defenite was done.
('41', 382, 6, 13, 714326) I have now heard that the mill owners are going to start their own Swadesh League which means of course that we are not coming to any terms.
('41', 382, 6, 14, 714467) The AshramI had a long discussion with Lalaji today, for he was here for two days.
('41', 382, 6, 15, 714550) He is enthusiastic about boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 382, 6, 16, 714601) I have supplied him with literature.
('41', 382, 6, 17, 714638) He even suggested that I should invite a few leaders and confer with [them] about boycott.
('41', 382, 6, 18, 714729) I told him I had not the courage to do so.
('41', 382, 6, 19, 714772) He is of opinion that if intense boycott propaganda is to be taken up, I must not go out of the country, wherein of course I agree; but I cannot take up intense propaganda unless politically minded India is wholeheartedly with me and unless the agitation about temporary boycott of British cloth, principally British cloth, is given up.
('41', 382, 6, 20, 715109) We have, therefore, come to this provisional arrangement that if anything concrete takes place by spontaneous action on the part of the known leaders, I should give up the idea of going to Europe.
('41', 382, 6, 21, 715306) On the other hand [if] nothing of that kind happens and if otherwise I see my way clear, I should proceed and that Lalaji and others who are minded like him should cultivate an atmosphere for intense propaganda about foreign cloth boycott with or without the Assistance of mills.
('41', 382, 6, 22, 715586) I therefore suggest that you should confer with
('41', 383, 0, 1, 715634) 384 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 383, 1, 2, 715676) Dr. Ansari and others.
('41', 383, 1, 3, 715699) I suppose they will all go to the Punjab and pass the resolution about foreign cloth boycott through khadi.
('41', 383, 1, 4, 715807) I would warn you against any mention of indigenous mill cloth.
('41', 383, 1, 5, 715870) You can simply say: Whereas the only effective means of immediately demonstrating the united strength of the nation lies through boycott of foreign cloth, this Conference urges all concerned completely to boycott foreign cloth and adopt hand spun and handwoven khadi even though such adoption may necessitate revision of ones taste about dress and some pecuniary sacrifice. You will also let me know the result of private discussions you may have with friends and advise me as to whethere I should give up the idea of going to Europe.
('41', 383, 1, 6, 716405) Dr. Ansari should really be able to decide.
('41', 383, 2, 7, 716449) Yours sincerely,

('41', 383, 4, 9, 716495) 447. LETTER TO SHANKARAN
('41', 383, 5, 10, 716520) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, April, 8, 1928
('41', 383, 6, 11, 716558) MY DEAR SHANKARAN,
('41', 383, 7, 12, 716577) I was thinking of you only early this morning, that is, just after prayer when talking to Pyarelal and here is your letter.
('41', 383, 7, 13, 716701) Suppose that there is a colony of orphans shipwrecked on an island, that they are all unmarried males, that they have never known that they ever had any parents, suppose further that they have a knowledge of letters and that from their reading they under stood that they had all parents; suppose then that they in the course of their readings coem upon a philosophical book called Our Spontaneous Origin, should the orphans feel convinced philosophically that they were all spontaneous creation?
('41', 383, 7, 14, 717197) Just as the supposed philosophical book would not unsettle the conviction of the majority of the unsophisticated orphans, so should the philosophical book that you have read about the non existence of God not unsettle your belief in God.
('41', 383, 7, 15, 717435) If you will admit the fact of your having parents, how can you escape the fundamental fact of the First Cause?
('41', 383, 7, 16, 717546) Having made sure of that, I am indifferent whether you call that First Cause God or some other thing.
('41', 383, 7, 17, 717648) And having been also convinced of that fact it is wholly
('41', 384, 0, 1, 717705) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 385
('41', 384, 1, 2, 717747) unnecessary to inquire how that First Cause disposes of justice or to inquire about the injustice that we seem to see around us.
('41', 384, 1, 3, 717876) There are endless theories.
('41', 384, 1, 4, 717904) I believe in that of cause and effect, that is, of the law of karma.
('41', 384, 1, 5, 717973) It seems to answer all a mans doubts.
('41', 384, 1, 6, 718011) But if they do not answer yours,you must wait, watch and pray and you will some day have the light.
('41', 384, 1, 7, 718111) But if you do not believe in the First Cause, there is no hope.
('41', 384, 1, 8, 718175) For to whom should you pray then?
('41', 384, 1, 9, 718209) Therefore hold fast to your belief in God, never mind the reasoning.
('41', 384, 1, 10, 718278) Can you reason out the existence of your parents?
('41', 384, 1, 11, 718328) Will you not say, Whether I can reason or not the existence of my parents is an absolute fact with me?
('41', 384, 1, 12, 718431) If you cannot prove it to the satisfaction of your inquirers, you will say my reasoning is at fault but not the fact.
('41', 384, 1, 13, 718549) Even so must you say to yourself, Though I may not be able to reason out the existence of God, I must accept the experience of and the belief of mankind in the First Cause.
('41', 384, 1, 14, 718722) If even now you are not satisfied, you must ask me again.
('41', 384, 2, 15, 718780) Yours sincerely,

('41', 384, 6, 19, 718912) PRABHUDAS, For the last so many days or even months, I have wanted to write to you but how was it possible for me to find time for it ?
('41', 384, 6, 20, 719048) This, too, I am dictating immediately after the morning prayers.
('41', 384, 6, 21, 719113) I have got the shawl sent by you and when the time comes, I shall certainly use it.
('41', 384, 6, 22, 719197) But in this season, the occasion will never come.
('41', 384, 6, 23, 719247) I am getting fully acquainted with your activities and am pleased with them.
('41', 384, 6, 24, 719324) I even rejoice in them.
('41', 384, 6, 25, 719348) But do remember that you are not to pursue any activity at the cost of your health for, your first duty in going there lies in improving your health.
('41', 384, 6, 26, 719498) However, if you can make use of your activities in improving it, I do not have to warn you.
('41', 384, 6, 27, 719590) Do not have so much attachment for the activities that they ruin your health, and in order to regain it, you have to sacrifice your activities.
('41', 384, 6, 28, 719734) It is like a saint losing both the worlds.
('41', 384, 6, 29, 719777) Remember that the efforts to improve your health are also meant to excel in devotion to your duty.
('41', 385, 0, 1, 719876) 386 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 385, 1, 2, 719918) Nothing has yet been decided about my going to Europe.
('41', 385, 1, 3, 719973) It has been left to me to decide but I do not have the confidence to take a decision in this matter 1. I do not know what is good.
('41', 385, 1, 4, 720104) I do not at all like going there, but in a week or two, I will decide this way or that.
('41', 385, 1, 5, 720192) You are dreaming of paying a visit here.
('41', 385, 1, 6, 720233) Forget about it.
('41', 385, 1, 7, 720250) It is attachment.
('41', 385, 1, 8, 720268) You are not fully aware of our wish to rub shoulders with the crores of suffering and half starved people.
('41', 385, 1, 9, 720375) Before spending each rupee, you must reckon that with that money, sixty four persons can comfortably have their second meal.
('41', 385, 1, 10, 720500) Moreover there is no need to risk your health by coming here in this weather.
('41', 385, 1, 11, 720578) We meet through letters; that is no less grace of God.
('41', 385, 1, 12, 720633) You are inviting Kashi.
('41', 385, 1, 13, 720657) The above argument applies in her case also.
('41', 385, 1, 14, 720702) Only warm climate suits Kashi.
('41', 385, 1, 15, 720733) The cold climate which you enjoy, which gives you strength, enfeebles Kashi.
('41', 385, 1, 16, 720810) As far as service to her is concerned, there is hardly anything you could do.
('41', 385, 1, 17, 720888) Besides, you The Ashrammay not even be able to do that, and for ones own help, one cannot call ones parents.
('41', 385, 1, 18, 720997) Moreover, you have made that relation virtuous.
('41', 385, 1, 19, 721045) Treat any invalid woman you see there as your mother and help her.
('41', 385, 1, 20, 721112) Consider such service as service rendered to Kashi.
('41', 385, 1, 21, 721164) In the same way, treat every invalid man as your father.
('41', 385, 1, 22, 721221) The spinning wheel makes us do the same.
('41', 385, 1, 23, 721262) It teaches us to render pure, selfless and dedicated service to numerous invalid and helpless parents, brothers, brothers in law and sons and daughters.
('41', 385, 1, 24, 721415) Day by day, you are gaining proficiency in rendering such service.
('41', 385, 1, 25, 721482) I am reminded of you by the figures you had given me about the growing business of lanterns, etc., here.
('41', 385, 1, 26, 721587) I find from Devdass letters that he is doing very good work in Jamia.
('41', 385, 1, 27, 721657) Do not hesitate to write to me whenever you feel like doing so.

('41', 386, 2, 11, 722359) Devdas has gone to Delhi.
('41', 386, 2, 12, 722385) A proposal is being discussed about my going to Europe.
('41', 386, 2, 13, 722441) I cannot make up my mind.
('41', 386, 2, 14, 722467) The matter will be decided within a week.

('41', 386, 7, 22, 722867) This is the National Week, and so I give as much time as I can spare and the body can endure, to spinning.
('41', 386, 7, 23, 722974) Hence I am dictating this letter.
('41', 386, 7, 24, 723008) You must have settled in phoenix by now.
('41', 386, 7, 25, 723049) I like your staying there.
('41', 386, 7, 26, 723076) It would be enough if Sushila went to the town twice or thrice to take her lessons.
('41', 386, 7, 27, 723160) As a matter of fact, knowledge of a language as well as other knowledge can be acquired by ones own effort.
('41', 386, 7, 28, 723268) I hope that Sushila is now completely all right.
('41', 386, 7, 29, 723317) Yesterday Mr. Wayne met me.

('41', 387, 6, 15, 724158) I meet him every day because nowadays I sit with the diners in the common kitchen where he also takes his meals.
('41', 387, 6, 16, 724271) I am glad you have written to me about him.
('41', 387, 6, 17, 724315) I shall keep my eyes on him, but I must also tell you that I have not nowadays got the time to come in close contact with so many inmates in the Ashram.

('41', 390, 1, 2, 726885) 456. A SEASONABLE PRODUCTION
('41', 390, 2, 3, 726914) Readers of Young India are familiar with the name of Richard B. Gregg, an American lawyer who was attracted to India over two years ago by the message of khadi and who has been studying the movement in a most minute manner ever since his arrival in India.
('41', 390, 2, 4, 727170) After a yearss labour, he has written a book on the movement which treats khadi in an almost original manner.
('41', 390, 2, 5, 727280) Every statement he has made is supported by facts and figures and footnotes give the authorities upon which Mr. Gregg has drawn.
('41', 390, 2, 6, 727409) The book is published by S. Ganesan, 18 Pycrofts Road, Triplicane, Madras, and is priced at Rs. 1 8 0. From cover to cover it occupies 225 pages of which 165 225 contain seven appendices.
('41', 390, 2, 7, 727597) The book contains 12 chapters.
('41', 390, 2, 8, 727628) Let the reader also understand that Mr. Gregg, when he writes of villages, writes of things he has somewhat seen.
('41', 390, 2, 9, 727742) The three opening paragraphs of his introduction show the reader the way in which Mr. Gregg has worked : 1
('41', 390, 3, 10, 727849) It was in order to remove this poverty that Mr. Gregg was driven to an examination of the various schemes proposed to that end and he was forced to the conclusion that the spinning wheel was the only real solution.
('41', 390, 3, 11, 728064) The author says: 2
('41', 390, 4, 12, 728083) This little book is a statement of how the project looks to one who had seven years of practical work and study in industrial and labour problem in America (much of it in cotton mills), together with two and a half years study in India of the khaddar movement.
('41', 390, 4, 13, 728344) The latter period included observation both in the villages and at the headquarters of the movement.
('41', 390, 4, 14, 728445) The investigation was undertaken primarily to clarify my own thinking.
('41', 390, 4, 15, 728516) The originality of Mr. Greggs examination of the problem consists in his approach to it from the engineering aspect which is the title of the first chapter, and he has no difficulty in showing that the The Ashrammaterial prosperity of a country is increased not merely by accumulation of power or machinery but by the right use of it.
('41', 390, 5, 16, 728851) 1 The paragraphs quoted are not reproduced here.
('41', 390, 5, 17, 728900) Gregg had written: In former days India was regarded as a very rich country, and prior to the Mohammedan conquest at least, the wealth was widely distributed among her people.
('41', 390, 5, 18, 729076) But now, although India is still considered a source of much wealth, the Indian people are ranked among the poverty stricken of the world, .
('41', 390, 5, 19, 729217) as Professor Gilbert Slater of Madras University says: The poverty of India is a grim fact.  2 Only an extract is reproduced here.
('41', 391, 0, 1, 729348) 392 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 391, 1, 2, 729390) This is how he opens his argument :
('41', 391, 2, 3, 729426) Following Mr. Fords idea that the right use of power is more important than any particular kind of machinery, let us briefly examine the fundamentals of physical power and its utilization and then apply that as a test for the validity of the khaddar proposal.
('41', 391, 2, 4, 729686) We will first state the whole engineering argument in brief, and then consider it in a more detailed fashion.
('41', 391, 3, 5, 729796) All physical power is derived ultimately from the sum.
('41', 391, 3, 6, 729851) Coal and petroleum are, in effect, reservoirs from the stream of solar energy of past ages converted and stored up by vegetation.
('41', 391, 3, 7, 729981) Water power comes from the action of sunshine evaporating water from the oceans and transporting it to the land and rivers in the form of clouds and rain.
('41', 391, 3, 8, 730136) Even the mechanical energy of horses and cattle and man himself comes from food obtained from plants activated by sunshine.
('41', 391, 3, 9, 730260) All the power used in modern industry and in the economic activities of man in past ages came from his using some part of the never ending stream of solar energy.
('41', 391, 3, 10, 730423) The old Rigvedic hymns sang rightly of Savitar the Sun god: Savitar .
('41', 391, 3, 11, 730493) Lord of every blessing; and God Savitar, the good eyed, hath come hither giving choice treasures unto him who worships (R. V., x.
('41', 391, 3, 12, 730623) 149; i.
('41', 391, 4, 13, 730631) Any scheme which utilizes and efficintly transforms solar energy to a greater degree than was being done before is sound, from an engineering standpoint, and also from an economic point of view.
('41', 391, 5, 14, 730826) We do not usually think of the charkha as a machine, but it really is so.
('41', 391, 5, 15, 730900) It uses the available mechanical energy of a man, woman or child for producing material goods.
('41', 391, 5, 16, 730995) The handloom does likewise.
('41', 391, 5, 17, 731023) The mechanical energy is derived from the food eaten by the person.
('41', 391, 5, 18, 731091) Though in a different degree, manner and mode, the process is the same as that occurring in a steam engine or hydraulic power plant, namely, the transformation of solar energy into mechanical motion.
('41', 391, 6, 19, 731291) There are today great numbers of unemployed Indians.
('41', 391, 6, 20, 731344) They are, in effect, engines kept running by fuel (food), but not attached to any machines or devices for producing goods.
('41', 391, 6, 21, 731467) Mr. Gandhi proposes to hitch them to charkhas and thus save a vast existing waste of solar energy.
('41', 391, 7, 22, 731566) If we want to increase the use of mechanical power in India, this is the quickest and cheapest way.
('41', 391, 7, 23, 731666) The engines are all present; a man is as efficient a transformer of fuel energy into mechanical motion as a steam engine is; the spinning and weaving machinery to be used is nearly all ready at hand in The Ashramsufficient quantity to supply all needs.
('41', 391, 7, 24, 731919) Any additional needs can be quickly and cheaply produced in India by artisans who need no further training in technical skill for this purpose; the speed and quantity of output possible

('41', 392, 1, 2, 732147) with charkha and handloom are more closely adapted to the needs of the Indian market and Indian producers than any other type or machinery; no foreign capital is needed to purchase the machinery, and therefore there will be no expensive interest payments or difficulties arising from absentee control; the maintenance of such a factory is inexpensive and can be done entirely by available workers without further training: the amount of training needed for operatives is a minimum and of a sort more easily acquired than for any other type of machinery; the fuel or power cost for the man charkha system will be nothing above the present food bill of the nation; the material to be used is available in practically every Indian province at a minimum of transportation cost; and the market is everywhere.
('41', 392, 1, 3, 732951) I must resist the temptation to quote from the other chapters.
('41', 392, 1, 4, 733014) But if the foregoing excerpts have at all proved tempting for the reader, let me assure him that he will find that the chapters that follows are fully interesting and deeply instructive.
('41', 392, 1, 5, 733201) Let me close this hasty review with giving the names of the remaining 11 chapters.

('41', 393, 2, 3, 733798) Lovers of khadi have been writing to me energetically warn ing me against coquetting with mill owners in the vain hope, as they call it, of securing their active co operation on terms beneficial to the nation in the prosecution of the campaign of boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 393, 2, 4, 734071) I appreciate their warning.
('41', 393, 2, 5, 734099) Some of them are tried and experi enced workers in the khadi movement.
('41', 393, 2, 6, 734170) But I do not give up hope of the mill owners some day or other coming round to the national view.
('41', 393, 2, 7, 734268) After all as an out and out believer in the method of non violence, I may not let a single opportunity to slip of converting the mill owners to the nationalistic view, even as I may not pass by a single occasion of converting Englishmen to the Indian view of Indians good.
('41', 393, 2, 8, 734541) After all, if we are to win our freedom by non violent means, we shall have to knock at the doors of those who put obstacles in its way and plead with them to remove them.
('41', 393, 2, 9, 734713) And even as in a bloody revolution those who are supposed to stand in the way are made to pay the last penalty whether they are countrymen or otherwise, so in a non violent revolution are they, whether countrymen or foreigners, required to face satyagraha, if they will not listen to reason and wil obstinately stand in the way.
('41', 393, 2, 10, 735042) I therefore see no harm in having stated the conditions on which mill owners can co operate with the nation.
('41', 393, 2, 11, 735151) It would have been wrong not to have done so.
('41', 393, 2, 12, 735197) And if they accept the terms, I know that khadi, i.
('41', 393, 2, 13, 735249) e., the masses have nothing to lose.
('41', 393, 2, 14, 735286) For if the mills work not for exploiting the masses as they now do, but for serving them, they will supplement the products of the cottage spinning wheel and the handloom and not supersede them as they now do.
('41', 393, 2, 15, 735496) There is no doubt that if they hesitate to accept the terms stated by me, they will do so because the logical consequence repels them even as the logical consequence of Englishmen really becoming servants of the nation repels them.
('41', 393, 2, 16, 735728) I would therefore ask khadi lovers not to be afraid of my so called coquetting.
('41', 393, 2, 17, 735808) If we are strong in our faith, if khadi has the inherent vitality we claim for it, if it is the need of the masses, and if we persist in our effort with them, they will not fail to realize it.
('41', 393, 2, 18, 736001) Khadi will fail only when khadi lovers falter in their faith or if their faith is based on a mere shadow, i.e., if there is no grinding poverty among the masses, if they have no leisure hours during the year, or if, though The Ashramthey have spare hours, the spinning wheel is not the most
('41', 394, 0, 1, 736292) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 395
('41', 394, 1, 2, 736334) suitable and practicable occupation conceivable for many millions.
('41', 394, 1, 3, 736401) It is because of the implicit faith I have in khadi in terms of the propositions just stated and of the strength born of that faith that I am coquetting with the mill owners.
('41', 394, 1, 4, 736576) It is quite likely, it is perhaps now practically certain, that no immediate good will come out of these negotiations.
('41', 394, 1, 5, 736695) But they will serve for further action or guidance if we have not meanwhile already achived boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 394, 1, 6, 736813) It is therefore profitable to inquire, even at the risk of repe tition, what place khadi has in any scheme of boycott.
('41', 394, 1, 7, 736932) In my opinion, boycott of foreign cloth is both necessary and feasible only because it affects and benefits the masses and can be achieved only if they co operate.
('41', 394, 1, 8, 737096) Boycott of foreign cloth would have but a temporary value if it could be obtained solely by the indigenous mills.
('41', 394, 1, 9, 737210) And I hold it to be impossible in the near future to enforce the boycott through the single agency of mills.
('41', 394, 1, 10, 737319) In my opinion, it is khadi alone that has made such boycott a practical proposition.
('41', 394, 1, 11, 737404) Indeed it is so practical that if the politically minded India were to take up the sales of khadi, it is possible to manufacture in a year all the khadi that may be required by the nation even though there may be not a single yard of mill calicoforeign or indigenousavailable.
('41', 394, 1, 12, 737681) I affirm this on the basis of the assumption that the villages will mostly manufa cture their own khadi and the organized centres will manufacture for those who are not self spinniers.
('41', 394, 1, 13, 737866) Experience of past seven years shows that if there is a sudden famine of cloth in the country and if the masses are encouraged they have sufficient skil and the indigenous machi nery for manufacturing their own khadi.
('41', 394, 1, 14, 738084) No doubt a revolution ary change in the mental outlook and sartorial tastes of politically minded India is necessary.
('41', 394, 1, 15, 738202) I have no doubt that if the bulk of them do not respond now, they will have to do so when they realize that khadi has become irresistible.
('41', 394, 1, 16, 738341) And to make it irresistible khadi workers have to work away with steadfastness, honesty, scientific skill and precision.
('41', 394, 1, 17, 738462) I have coquetted with mill owners and discussed the possibility of immediate boycott of foreign cloth in association with them, in order to show that if they mean it they can give themselves the privilege of serving the nation at the same time that they serve themselves.
('41', 394, 1, 18, 738734) Meanwhile, let none doubt that khadi is silently and imperceptibly revolutionizing the national taste and will bring about the boycott in its own good time, if it not anticipated by some such combination as I have ventured to suggest.

('41', 395, 2, 3, 739045) BREACH OF PROMISE?
('41', 395, 3, 4, 739064) When I was in Berhampur, Ganjam District, last year, I was taken to a temple which I was told was open to all including the so called untouchables.
('41', 395, 3, 5, 739212) I was accompanied by some untouchable friends.
('41', 395, 3, 6, 739259) A few weeks after I received a letter that the trustees had declared prohibition against the entry of untouchables.
('41', 395, 3, 7, 739375) I was loath to believe the statement.
('41', 395, 3, 8, 739413) I, therefore, inquired and here is the reply to my inquiry : 1
('41', 395, 4, 9, 739476) If the information is correct, it is clear breach of promise by the trusteesa promise that was publicly made not merely to me but to the public of Berhampur through me.
('41', 395, 4, 10, 739645) I wonder whether the trustees have any defence of explanation to offer.
('41', 395, 4, 11, 739717) The untouchables have undoubtedly a clear case for offering satyagraha in this case.
('41', 395, 4, 12, 739802) I do hope however that the public of Berhampur will redeem their self respect by insisting on removal of the bar, if the bar does as a matter of fact exist.

('41', 396, 7, 8, 741132) MY DEAR MOTILALJI, I have your letter.
('41', 396, 7, 9, 741171) I did not write without full knowledge of what was being done on behalf of mill owners.
('41', 396, 7, 10, 741259) They are starting a separate organization which will have nothing to do with us.
('41', 396, 7, 11, 741340) However I am quite at one with you what we should leave no stone unturned to secure their full co operation.
('41', 396, 7, 12, 741449) I am doing all I can at this end and you will let me know what success you have with Sir Purushottamdas.
('41', 396, 7, 13, 741554) But I would like you to study the possibilites of the charkha movement.
('41', 396, 7, 14, 741626) It is not so hopeless as you seem to think.
('41', 396, 7, 15, 741670) Let me put the position in a nutshell.
('41', 396, 7, 16, 741709) Mills by themselves cannot achieve the boycott within the time that will satisfy the politician buy mills if they play the game together with charkha can do so within a time that will satisfy the most sanguine expectations of any patriot.
('41', 396, 7, 17, 741948) The charkha by itself can achieve the boycott within a reasonable period, the pace being dependent upon intensity of the work put in by the politicians.
('41', 396, 7, 18, 742101) And as a khadi manufacturer, I am open to negotiate with anyone for supplying almost an illimitable quantity provided he does not bind me to the quality beyond a certain limit and does not mind the cost.
('41', 396, 8, 19, 742305) 1 The letter is not reproduced here.
('41', 396, 8, 20, 742342) The concession was that subject to certain conditions the Union Government would refrain from the full enforcement of section 10 of Act 22 of 1913 as amended by section 5 of Act 37 of 1927 in the case of an Indian who proves .
('41', 396, 8, 21, 742569) that he entered a province of the Union, other than the Orange Free State, prior to the 5th July, 1924.
('41', 396, 8, 22, 742673) 2 The condition was that those wives and children, who were not already brought to the Union of South Africa before July 5, 1927, would not be admitted.

('41', 397, 2, 4, 743038) The only thing that hampers the progress of khadi is the want of demand and want of capital.
('41', 397, 2, 5, 743131) I am yet awaiting the expected reply from Romain Rolland.
('41', 397, 2, 6, 743189) If he does not cable, I may get a letter from him next week.

('41', 397, 6, 10, 743328) Thursday [April 12, 1928] 2
('41', 397, 7, 11, 743356) BHAISHRI DEVCHANDBHAI, I have decided to hand over to the All India Spinners Association, the Kathiawar khadi work and all the equipment and debts relating to it.
('41', 397, 7, 12, 743519) Taking responsibility for this work upon ourselves means my worrying about the money problems.
('41', 397, 7, 13, 743614) I feel that there should be a regular resolution about this.
('41', 397, 7, 14, 743675) You should therefore get such a resolution passed in the Committee or get the consent of members through a circular.
('41', 397, 7, 15, 743792) It seems that Revashanker Anupchand wishes to take possession of Manasukhlals house in lieu of the debt which the latter owes him.
('41', 397, 7, 16, 743923) If you know anything about this matter, please let me know.
('41', 397, 7, 17, 743983) Valji says that you are of the opinion that Revashanker cannot take possession of the house.

('41', 398, 1, 2, 744295) 462. SPEECH TO TRAINEES AT KHADI VIDYALAYA, AHMEDABAD 1
('41', 398, 2, 3, 744351) [Before April 13, 1928] 2
('41', 398, 3, 4, 744377) The idea of the Khadi Seva Sangh was mine.
('41', 398, 3, 5, 744420) I felt that just as the Government has an organization, its naukarshahi, 3 it would be good for us also to have an organization of workers.
('41', 398, 3, 6, 744560) The Govern ments naukarshahi is called shahi 4 because its members, although they are servants, function as rulers.
('41', 398, 3, 7, 744676) But we are not shahi because we have to do real service.
('41', 398, 3, 8, 744733) For admission to this organization a course The Ashramof fixed period was prescribed because in order to be a khadi worker training and proficiency are required.
('41', 398, 3, 9, 744895) The science of khadi is a serious affair; its scope is extremely vast, because through this science we want to serve the 33 crore people of India and through them the whole world.
('41', 398, 3, 10, 745075) It is an empirical science; astronomy, on the contrary, is not an empirical science.
('41', 398, 3, 11, 745160) The science of khadi is empirical because its experiments and conclusions are accessible to experience.
('41', 398, 3, 12, 745264) Thirty three crores of people can have direct experience of it.
('41', 398, 3, 13, 745328) Hence its scope extends to where name of God reaches.
('41', 398, 3, 14, 745382) The vastness of this science can be realized from the fact that all the things that are done in textile mills we have to do in our homes.
('41', 398, 3, 15, 745520) Those who run these mills have had to read a number of technical books the study of which is essential for acquiring proficiency in the work.
('41', 398, 3, 16, 745662) Take only one process.
('41', 398, 3, 17, 745685) Just as in the mills they have to test cotton, we too have to do it.
('41', 398, 3, 18, 745754) These knowledge which they require as to the strength of cotton, cotton gathering, etc., is also required by us.
('41', 398, 3, 19, 745867) Our very first lesson is about cotton and it is a very important one.
('41', 398, 3, 20, 745937) There are indeed many things which we have to do but which the mills are not required to do.
('41', 398, 3, 21, 746030) For example, the mills do not have to bother whether in ginning the cotton seeds remain intact or are broken, but we cannot afford to be careless in the matter.
('41', 398, 3, 22, 746191) We want that the seeds should retain their properties.
('41', 398, 3, 23, 746246) We want to feed these to the cattle and extract oil from them.
('41', 398, 3, 24, 746309) Mills have nothing at all to do with all these
('41', 398, 4, 25, 746356) 1 The Khadi Vidyalaya was run at the Ashram for candidates selected for admission to the Khadi Seva Sangh.

('41', 399, 0, 1, 746592) 400 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 399, 1, 2, 746634) things.
('41', 399, 1, 3, 746642) However rich we may be in resources, and however persistent in our efforts, it is all useless without a purpose.
('41', 399, 1, 4, 746755) That purpose is national service.
('41', 399, 1, 5, 746789) And it is so vast that one can go as deep into it as one chooses.
('41', 399, 1, 6, 746855) There is no end to the labours of the mills because they have a selfish motive, they have to earn money.
('41', 399, 1, 7, 746960) In their set up there is scope for punishment as well as for reward and, after all, what is the principle of reward if it is not one of punishment?
('41', 399, 1, 8, 747108) In our case there is no selfishness and no punishment.
('41', 399, 1, 9, 747163) But it is not proper that since there is no selfishness we should not work as much as they do in mills.
('41', 399, 1, 10, 747267) Our work is as deserving of efforts as it is selfless.
('41', 399, 1, 11, 747322) The more love and labour we pour into it, the quicker will be our victory.
('41', 399, 1, 12, 747397) Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose takes a leaf from a plant and very carefully and minutely examines it to see how many sections it has, whether it has organs of sense and whether it can feel as human beings do.
('41', 399, 1, 13, 747601) He then places the results of his experiments before the world.
('41', 399, 1, 14, 747665) Does he do this The Ashramfor money?
('41', 399, 1, 15, 747702) No Then does he do so for fame?
('41', 399, 1, 16, 747734) He does it without any selfish motive.
('41', 399, 1, 17, 747773) But his objective is gaining knowledge, whereas our experiments are not purely for the sake of knowledge.
('41', 399, 1, 18, 747879) Ours is an empirical science and we want to se its actual results.
('41', 399, 1, 19, 747946) We have to observe carefully how much cotton is obtained from a given quantity of raw cotton, how much yarn is prepared out of that cotton and how much cloth is woven out of that yarn.
('41', 399, 1, 20, 748131) And in this way we can calculate how many people have to put in how much labour in order to meet the cloth requirements of the whole country.
('41', 399, 1, 21, 748273) Acquire as much knowledge as you can in order to gain mastery of this science and carry out as many experiments as necessary.
('41', 399, 1, 22, 748399) For this, you should have enthusiasm, interest and dedication.
('41', 399, 1, 23, 748462) The person who cultivates this science with devotion will be granted the inner light by God.
('41', 399, 1, 24, 748555) But it is not enough for us merely acquire knowledge of this science.
('41', 399, 1, 25, 748625) Mere knowledge would be useful in mills only.
('41', 399, 1, 26, 748671) We need character in addition to this knowledge.
('41', 399, 1, 27, 748720) You have come here not for earning your livelihood but with a desire to serve, to dedicate your life to the cause of khadi, and for this character will be very essential.
('41', 399, 1, 28, 748891) How will you go among the people without character?
('41', 399, 1, 29, 748943) Who will accept your service?
('41', 399, 1, 30, 748973) Nobody bothers about the character of people working in mills but everybody will enquire about your character.
('41', 399, 1, 31, 749084) You have to go to the people as servants, not as tyrants.
('41', 399, 1, 32, 749142) If possible, you have to be

('41', 400, 1, 2, 749212) labourers living in their midst.
('41', 400, 1, 3, 749245) For doing this a disciplined life is needed.
('41', 400, 1, 4, 749290) And cleanliness will be the first sign by which you can show your character.
('41', 400, 1, 5, 749367) The impression which you will be able to create in the people by strict observance of the rules of cleanliness, you will not be able to do in any other way.
('41', 400, 1, 6, 749524) And what is desirable is that you should not follow these rules for the sake of following them but it should become impossible for you not to follow them.
('41', 400, 1, 7, 749679) You should so mould your nature that cleanliness becoemse a part of it; if you find uncleanliness anywhere you should be unable to bear it.
('41', 400, 1, 8, 749819) Uncleanliness anywhere, whoever may be responsible for it, should become an eyesore to us and unless it is removed we should find no joy in living.
('41', 400, 1, 9, 749967) We wish to offer ourselves as oblation in the national yajna.
('41', 400, 1, 10, 750029) In order to do so we have to become pure and clean.
('41', 400, 1, 11, 750081) Does it do any The Ashramgood burning a dirty thing?
('41', 400, 1, 12, 750134) But if your burn something fragrant, the atmoshepre is purified and the perfume spreads.
('41', 400, 1, 13, 750223) Therefore let us become pure like sandalwood and offer ourselves up in this sacrifice.
('41', 400, 1, 14, 750310) This is the purpose for which this Ashram has been established.
('41', 400, 1, 15, 750374) Let the Ashram become the incense in the national sacrifice and remove the foul smell wherever it may be found.
('41', 400, 1, 16, 750486) This is our ideal.
('41', 400, 1, 17, 750505) Indeed, this is not the Ashrams ideal only, but that of every khadi worker.
('41', 400, 1, 18, 750581) And are you aware what a high place your work occupies?
('41', 400, 1, 19, 750637) If someone asked me what the place of khadi in relation to service of the cow or tanning was, I should surely say that it had the first place.
('41', 400, 1, 20, 750780) According to the grand simile of Tulsidas, this is the most benevolent activity, even though it seems dull:
('41', 400, 2, 21, 750888) How monotonous spinning appears!
('41', 400, 2, 22, 750921) The Punjabis tell me that it is a womens work and that they cannot do it.
('41', 400, 2, 23, 750995) Then there is neither honour nor profit in khadi work.
('41', 400, 2, 24, 751050) If one becoemes expert in dairying or tanning, one can get big emoluments.
('41', 400, 2, 25, 751125) But in khadi there is no such attraction because it is the work of millions of people.
('41', 400, 2, 26, 751212) We requires seven lakh workers in order to organize khadi work throughout the country.
('41', 400, 2, 27, 751299) How can we afford to give them high salaries?
('41', 400, 2, 28, 751345) Perhaps seven
('41', 401, 0, 1, 751359) 402 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 401, 1, 2, 751401) lakh cow workers or tanning experts may not be required by the country, but it would not do to have less than this number for khadi work.
('41', 401, 1, 3, 751539) 'This work is so important and it is required on such a big scale.
('41', 401, 1, 4, 751606) Despite its seeming monotony, there is hardly any other work more intresting than this.
('41', 401, 1, 5, 751694) If you start taking lots of interest in it, you would adorn yourself, the Ashram and the country as well.

('41', 403, 3, 6, 753632) I, belonging to a pauper country, think fifty times before sending cablegrams and each time say to myself one rupee means 64 hungry mouths fed per day after an hours work each.

('41', 405, 2, 5, 755424) 1 with his letter, I presume that you have got conclusive proof of his dishonesty.
('41', 405, 2, 6, 755507) 2 Before I can send him a final answer, I want to know whether there is any written or printed contract which.
('41', 405, 2, 7, 755618) 3 signed and, if he did, whether it has any clause regarding automatic forfeiture of security.
('41', 405, 2, 8, 755713) If there is no such written agreement about forfeiture, are you justified without the intervention of court in declaring forfeiture.
('41', 405, 3, 9, 755846) Yours sincerely, Encl.

('41', 405, 7, 13, 755953) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 405, 7, 14, 755986) You should know that I am now no longer in charge of the administration of the Association 5. Seth Jamnalal Bajaj is the administrative head, but I am interesting myself in your case and have written to Sjt.
('41', 405, 7, 15, 756194) Ramanathan.
('41', 405, 7, 16, 756206) As soon as I hear from him, I hope to write to you again.
('41', 405, 7, 17, 756264) Meanwhile let me say that from the perusal of the papers sent by you, there seems to me to be a very strong case against you.
('41', 405, 7, 18, 756390) If Sjt.
('41', 405, 7, 19, 756398) Ramanathan has positive proof of bribery and corruption, I should wonder what defence you could have.

('41', 406, 3, 5, 756801) DEAR DR.
('41', 406, 3, 6, 756810) ANSARI, I have your letter.
('41', 406, 3, 7, 756838) If the meeting of the representatives of mill owners comes off and if you give me due notice, I shall be present.
('41', 406, 3, 8, 756952) But up to now there is no intimation from Motilalji.
('41', 406, 3, 9, 757005) I am in constant touch with the representatives of millowners and so far as I am aware nothing is going to come out of these negotiations.
('41', 406, 3, 10, 757144) The mill owners have decided upon a separate organi zation of their own from which they wish to eschew politics altogether.
('41', 406, 3, 11, 757268) Sir Purushottamdas has declined to be president even of this association.
('41', 406, 3, 12, 757342) And I understand that he has come to the conclusion that the mill owners will do nothing substantial at the present moment.
('41', 406, 3, 13, 757466) Mr. Birla writes to me almost in the same strain, though he wants the boycott campaign without the mill owners.
('41', 406, 3, 14, 757578) After having had so many The Ashramchats and so much correspondence with the latter, I incline to the same view.
('41', 406, 3, 15, 757691) But that does not mean that we should not have the conference Motilalji has in in view.
('41', 406, 3, 16, 757779) You will keep me informed of what is going on.
('41', 406, 3, 17, 757826) I would like you to read all I have written about the mills in the pages of Young India.
('41', 406, 3, 18, 757915) If you have not the articles I can send them to you.
('41', 406, 3, 19, 757968) I wish you will settle the Jamia constitution without delay.
('41', 406, 4, 20, 758029) Yours sincerely, DR.

('41', 407, 2, 3, 758236) BHAISHRI VITHALBHAI, This letter is in reply to yours.
('41', 407, 2, 4, 758291) If the boycott becomes universal, we do not have enough chhayal 1 and dhotis.
('41', 407, 2, 5, 758369) We can meet the demands of those who will go about, if need be, in a langoti 2, but wear nothing except khadi.
('41', 407, 2, 6, 758480) To those, however, who are not ready to go to this extent but will take part in the boycott of foreign cloth if they can get some other cloth in its place, we may supply mill made dhotis and saris.
('41', 407, 2, 7, 758678) This means that the mills cannot manufacture any other cloth except what we decide and that, even in their shope, khadi will be sold as a substitute for the kinds of cloth which they do not manufacture.
('41', 407, 2, 8, 758881) I can realize that the mills will not agree to this, but we cannot come to any understanding with them as long as they do not agree.
('41', 407, 2, 9, 759014) My demand means that the mills should accept the permanent place of khadi.
('41', 407, 2, 10, 759089) If you do not understand this point, please ask me.
('41', 407, 2, 11, 759141) I do not want you to come here, leaving your work unattended there.
('41', 407, 2, 12, 759209) You may discuss the matter when you have occasion to come here and get the necessary opportu nity.

('41', 408, 3, 4, 759524) BHAISHRI DEVCHANDBHAI, I have your letter.
('41', 408, 3, 5, 759567) I understand about Manasukhlal although I am very much confused.
('41', 408, 3, 6, 759632) I am of the opinion that if a person has incurred debts he himself or his wife or children have to right to keep anything from the wealth amassed by him.
('41', 408, 3, 7, 759786) But I do not know the facts of this case.
('41', 408, 3, 8, 759828) And that reminds me: may I know if something has been done about the memorial to him?
('41', 408, 3, 9, 759914) It is necessary to pass the following resolution about khadi : As the Kathiawar Political Conference has many occupations, it does not have enough men and money to bear the responsibility of the khadi activity.
('41', 408, 3, 10, 760125) Gandhiji who hitherto used to shoulder the economic responsibility does not have the physical means to do so.
('41', 408, 3, 11, 760235) The All India Spinners Association is willing to shoulder the responsibility.
('41', 408, 3, 12, 760313) Therefore the Committee of this Conference hands over the entire administration, all its money and the entire responsi bility of the Kathiawar khadi activity to the All India Spinners Association. Did Mulchandbhai get money for the Antyaja movement?
('41', 408, 3, 13, 760563) Bhai Fulchand is not with you, so who helps you now?
('41', 408, 3, 14, 760616) What other work of the Conference is going on at present?
('41', 408, 4, 15, 760674) Vandemataram from BAPU PS.
('41', 408, 4, 16, 760701) One can see that you sold quite a good amount of khadi.

('41', 409, 1, 2, 760843) 473. SERVICE OF THE SUPPRESSED 1
('41', 409, 2, 3, 760876) The servant of the suppressed serves both himself and the society, as the oppressor ultimately oppresses himself, and the engi neer is always hoist with his own petard.
('41', 409, 2, 4, 761045) We were on the point of being pariahs of the world, having treated the bulk of our brethren as untouchables.
('41', 409, 2, 5, 761154) We are however likely to escape that catastrophe, as the Hindu society is trying to remove this blot in various ways and in many provinces.
('41', 409, 2, 6, 761294) By far the biggest and most successful of these efforts is perhaps the one conducted by Anasuyabehn in Ahmedabad.
('41', 409, 2, 7, 761408) I addressed two meetings last month, one under the auspices of the Sweepers Mahajan and the other a gathering of the children of the Labour Union schools.
('41', 409, 2, 8, 761563) 2 Most of these children belonged to the suppressed classes.
('41', 409, 2, 9, 761624) I take the following 3 from the report that was read at the meeting : I do not know of workmens children elsewhere receiving education under such orderly and careful organization and in such numbers.
('41', 409, 2, 10, 761824) The mill owners ought to welcome the enterprise.
('41', 409, 2, 11, 761873) On the contrary they are reported to have threatened to stop the monetary help they are at present giving.
('41', 409, 2, 12, 761980) I do hope not only that it is a false alarm, but that they will yearly add to their contributions.
('41', 409, 2, 13, 762079) In doing so I should humbly think they will be doing nothing beyond what they owe to their workmen.
('41', 409, 2, 14, 762179) A noteworthy feature of the enterprise is the large contribution of the workmen themselves towards the expenses, the ultimate aim being to conduct these schools wholly at their own expense.
('41', 409, 2, 15, 762369) This of course presupposes their economic betterment, a stimulation in them of the desire for sacrifice and for the education of their children.
('41', 409, 2, 16, 762514) In the mean while, the mill owners and other philanthropists should keep the enterprise going.

('41', 410, 0, 1, 762814) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 411
('41', 410, 1, 2, 762856) The sweepers meeting 1 was remarkable for the things it brought to light.
('41', 410, 1, 3, 762930) I heard them sing their songs with flawless pronunciation.
('41', 410, 1, 4, 762989) They were comparatively unlettered, but no one who listened to their songs could say that they belonged to the suppressed classes.
('41', 410, 1, 5, 763120) But they are indebted, underpaid, and addicted to drink.
('41', 410, 1, 6, 763177) Most of them beg and live on leavings from plates given to them by Hindus of higher castes.
('41', 410, 1, 7, 763269) Their condition makes the conclusion irresistible that we the so called high caste Hindus are responsible for their failings, and only the inherent strength of Hinduism is responsible for their good points.
('41', 410, 1, 8, 763476) Hinduism has helped them to retain some of their culture in spite of the oppression they have laboured under.
('41', 410, 1, 9, 763586) They would never have been reduced to their present state if we had regarded them as our own kith and kin.
('41', 410, 1, 10, 763693) Anasuyabehn may carry on welfare work among them, but who will look to their housing?
('41', 410, 1, 11, 763779) I have seen the hovels they live in.
('41', 410, 1, 12, 763816) It is the duty of the mill owners and the municipality to provide them with better houses, and even if the former fail in their duty the latter may not do so, for better housing is essential as much for the health of the city as for that of the workmen.
('41', 410, 2, 13, 764070) UNTOUCHABLES AMONG UNTOUCHABLES
('41', 410, 3, 14, 764102) I addressed a third meeting 2 which was full of painful experience.
('41', 410, 3, 15, 764170) There is a suppressed class night school under the Gujarat Vidyapith conducted by the students of the Vidyalaya.
('41', 410, 3, 16, 764283) They take considerable pains over the school, which until a short time ago had a very large attendance of Dhed children.
('41', 410, 3, 17, 764404) The teachers thought of the sweepers children and induced the sweepers to send their children to the school but as soon as these came, most of the Dheds withdrew their children form the school!
('41', 410, 3, 18, 764598) The teachers therefore turned to me to find a way out of the situation.
('41', 410, 3, 19, 764670) So I went there.
('41', 410, 3, 20, 764687) Very few Dhed parents attended the meeting.
('41', 410, 3, 21, 764731) One of them whom I tried to tackle said frankly, taking his stand on the traditional religion: How may a Dhed touch a sweeper? But if the touch of the sweeper pollutes the Dhed, why should the higher castes touch the Dheds?, I asked.
('41', 410, 3, 22, 764965) We never ask them to do so, he quickly rejoined, and floored me.
('41', 410, 4, 23, 765030) 1 Vide Speech at Sweepers Meeting, Ahmedabad, 27 3 1928. 2 No report of this meeting is available.
('41', 411, 0, 1, 765129) 412 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 411, 1, 2, 765171) This is how we are hoist with our own petard.
('41', 411, 1, 3, 765217) If untouchability had been allowed go to on unchecked, each one of us should have considered the other untouchable and we should have been doomed.
('41', 411, 1, 4, 765364) But thank God, in spite of the orthodox Dheds and Banias and Brahmins, the snake of untouchability is breathing its last.
('41', 411, 1, 5, 765486) The teachers of course ought to adhere to their resolve.
('41', 411, 1, 6, 765543) They should not be angry with the Dheds, but neither should they let go a single sweeper boy for the sake of the Dhed boys.
('41', 411, 1, 7, 765667) Let them shower all their love and attention on the sweeper boys, and there their duty ends.
('41', 411, 1, 8, 765760) Their determination and faith will melt the hearts of the Dheds, who, as soon as they find the sweepers children growing in cleanliness and character, will not help sending their own children too.
('41', 411, 1, 9, 765957) The anti untouchability worker has to begin at the lowermost rung of the ladder.
('41', 411, 1, 10, 766038) There are, I know, some reformers who are apt to think: Better reform and serve our own castes before we reform and serve the Dheds. This way of thinking betrays impatience and ignorance, impatance because we fight shy of obstacles, and ignorance because we forget that all other reform of Hinduism is nothing worth until the main reform, viz., the removal of untouchability, is achieved.
('41', 411, 1, 11, 766427) This blot poisons the whole system, even as a drop of arsenic would poison a tankful of milk.
('41', 411, 1, 12, 766521) Remove this and you open the door for other reforms, retain this and you render other reforms nugatory.
('41', 411, 1, 13, 766625) The disease of a consumptive unless the root cause is tackled remains just the same whether you remove or do not remove a few abscesses on his body.

('41', 414, 13, 15, 769083) Clause 5 if fully put into operation will undermine rights secured by struggle to even registration certificate holders whose claims go back to the beginning.

('41', 414, 13, 17, 769526) Thereafter inquisition deportations and demoralization of community inevitable.
('41', 414, 13, 18, 769606) We have urged that line be drawn 1914 at least to narrow field and preserve something of spirit of Gandhi Smuts Settlement.

('41', 414, 13, 20, 769794) Reply urgent (S.N. 11974).
('41', 414, 13, 21, 769821) 3 In reply Sastri sent a cable on April 18, 1928, reading: Your cable.

('41', 415, 2, 3, 770096) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, April 17, 1928
('41', 415, 3, 4, 770134) DEAR FRIEND, I have your letter.
('41', 415, 3, 5, 770167) There is a confusion of thought about your action.
('41', 415, 3, 6, 770218) If it was good for your friend to have the Law Membership, it was good both from a public point of view as well as a private point of view; and if it was legitimate for you to congratulate him in your private capacity, it was equally legi timate for you to congratulate him publicly and in your public capacity.
('41', 415, 3, 7, 770530) You will not congratulate privately or publicly a friend upon being appointed a hangman, the post might carry a large salary and distinction on the part of those who might appoint him.
('41', 415, 3, 8, 770715) Did we not think at one time that members of the present Government were very much like hangmen?
('41', 415, 3, 9, 770812) It was really a matter for condonation 1 that a friend was offered and accepted Law Membership.
('41', 415, 3, 10, 770908) But you may not share my view about the judgment of the present Government and those working it.
('41', 415, 3, 11, 771005) If that is so, you may publicly defend your private conduct and take the risk of any odium that may be temporarily attached to it.
('41', 415, 3, 12, 771136) After all, the approbation of your own conscience must be all sufficing.
('41', 415, 3, 13, 771209) You are quite correct in saying that if our private judgment and feelings were to be suppressed, we should become hypocrites.
('41', 415, 3, 14, 771335) It would be a bad day for us if servants of the public were to become hypocrites.
('41', 415, 4, 15, 771417) Yours sincerely, SJT.

('41', 416, 3, 4, 771638) MY DEAR JAWAHAR, I have your letter.
('41', 416, 3, 5, 771675) Do you know that even when you wrote to me that you were going to the Punjab, I did not know that you were going as the president of the Conference?
('41', 416, 3, 6, 771824) When Dr. Kitchlew wrote to me, he said nothing about who the president was to be.
('41', 416, 3, 7, 771906) However I was glad when I learnt that you presided.
('41', 416, 3, 8, 771958) Of course I notice everywhere what you noticed at the Conference.
('41', 416, 3, 9, 772024) I wonder if you have noticed what I sense everywhere, utter absence of seriousness and disinclination to do any concrete work demanding sustained energy.
('41', 416, 3, 10, 772178) Do you find any hope in the Punjab for Hindu Muslim unity?
('41', 416, 3, 11, 772237) About the European visit, I can give you no definite news yet.

('41', 417, 3, 7, 772696) I do indeed like your paper on modern finance.

('41', 418, 1, 2, 773776) 485. OFF THE TRAIL
('41', 418, 2, 3, 773795) Remarkable are the attempts made by and on behalf of the Government to befog peoples minds and take them away from the main point by raising side issues and discovering or professing to discover flaws in evidence produced in support of the main point.
('41', 418, 2, 4, 774047) It does not suit the Government to admit that its history is a history of the ruin of Indias industries and Indias manhood.
('41', 418, 2, 5, 774171) One of such recent attempts is to discredit the oft told story in the Press and on the platform about the cutting off by the weavers of their own thumbs in order to escape the East India Company myrmidons who sought to compel them to wind silk.
('41', 418, 2, 6, 774416) If the weaver has no thumb he cannot do the work expected of him.
('41', 418, 2, 7, 774482) And the way the history has been discredited is by digging out the credentials of William Bolts on the strength of whose evidence the late Romesh Chandra Dutt First made the statement regarding the cutting off of thumbs.
('41', 418, 2, 8, 774703) The writer of the refutation is not able to say that William Bolts gave false evidence, but he says that William Bolts had no character to keep and that therefore his evidence is not worthy of credence.
('41', 418, 2, 9, 774906) And he further says that he was a dismissed servant of the Company under its resolution which described him as a very unworthy and unprofitable servant of the Company, his conduct has been distinguished by a tenacious adherence to those pernicious principles relative to the rights of inland trade, in which he appears to have been so conspicuously oppressive.
('41', 418, 2, 10, 775267) Who does not know the tricks of pettifogging lawyers to discredit witnesses by proving their bad character as if a man with a bad character was ever incapable of making a true statement?
('41', 418, 2, 11, 775454) I make bold to say that whatever the character of William Bolts, his testimony about the cutting off of thumbs need not be discredited unless it can be otherwise disproved, and there has been nothing brought forward to show that that testimony is unworthy to be believed.
('41', 418, 2, 12, 775726) On the contrary, what is more likely than that weavers in order to escape harrowing and continuous oppression would once for all render themselves physically unfit to do the work imposed upon them under unbearable punishment?
('41', 418, 2, 13, 775952) After all, the evidence of William Bolts is only part of the story of the ruin of Indias industries told by Romesh Chandra Dutt with such deadly effect and supported by the evidence of a variety of witnesses, the cumulative effect of whose evidence becomes irresistible.
('41', 418, 2, 14, 776223) The main point is whether the industry was or was not
('41', 419, 0, 1, 776277) 420 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 419, 1, 2, 776319) ruined with the greatest deliberation.
('41', 419, 1, 3, 776358) If it was, it makes little difference if the evidence of one witness is rejected and it will lie ill in the mouth of the criminal to say that out of a hundred witnesses one has told an untruth.
('41', 419, 1, 4, 776552) But as I have said in this instance, there is nothing relevant brought forward to show that William Boltss testimony is not to be believed.
('41', 419, 1, 5, 776692) Let me however put before the reader a few relevant extracts from Dutts first volume of the Economic History of India.
('41', 419, 1, 6, 776811) He says :
('41', 419, 2, 7, 776821) It will appear from the facts stated in the last two chapters that large portions of the Indian population were engaged in various industries down to the first decade of the nineteenth century.
('41', 419, 2, 8, 777015) Weaving was still the national industry of the people; millions of women eked out the family income by their earnings from spinning; and dyeing, tanning and working in metals also gave employment to millions.
('41', 419, 2, 9, 777224) It was not, however, the policy of the East India Company to foster Indian industries.
('41', 419, 2, 10, 777311) It has been stated in a previous chapter that, as early as 1769, the Directors wished the manufacture of raw silk to be encouraged in Bengal, and that of silk fabrics discouraged.
('41', 419, 2, 11, 777491) And they also directed that silkwinders should be made to work in the Companys factories, and prohibited from working outside under severe penalties by the authority of the Government.
('41', 419, 2, 12, 777676) This mandate had its desired effect.
('41', 419, 2, 13, 777713) The manufacture of silk and cotton goods declined in India, and the people who had exported these goods to the markets of Europe and Asia in previous centuries began to import them in increasing quantities.
('41', 419, 2, 14, 777920) So much was the importation of silk and cotton goods from England stimulated by these methods that whereas in 1794 it was 156, in 1813 it rose to 108, 824. In 1813 the Companys charter was renewed and important evidence was taken at the enquiry prior to renewal.
('41', 419, 2, 15, 778183) In respect of Indian manufactures, says the author, theythe Commonssought to discover how they could be replaced by British manufactures, and how British industries could be promoted at the expense of Indian industries. The commercial policy of England is thus described by Henry St. George Tucker :
('41', 419, 3, 16, 778483) What is the commercial policy which we have adopted in this country with relation to India?
('41', 419, 3, 17, 778575) The silk manufactures and its piecegoods made of silk and cotton intermixed have long since been excluded altogether from our markets; and of late partly in consequence of the operation of a duty of 67 per cent, but chiefly from the effect of superior machinery, the cotton fabrics, which hiterto constituted the staple of India, have not only been displaced in
('41', 420, 0, 1, 778937) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 421
('41', 420, 1, 2, 778979) this country, but we actually export our cotton manufactures to supply a part of the consumption of our Asiatic possessions.
('41', 420, 1, 3, 779104) India is thus reduced from the state of a manufacturing to that of an agricultural country.
('41', 420, 1, 4, 779196) Here is another testimony of the same character by H. H. Wilson :
('41', 420, 2, 5, 779262) It is also a melancholy instance of the wrong done to India by the country on which she has become dependent.
('41', 420, 2, 6, 779372) It was stated in evidence (in 1813) that the cotton and silk goods of India up to the period could be sold for a profit in the British market at a price from 50 to 60 per cent lower than those fabricated in England.
('41', 420, 2, 7, 779588) It consequently became necessary to protect the latter by duties of 70 and 80 per cent, on their value, or by positive prohibition.
('41', 420, 2, 8, 779720) Had this not been the case, had not such prohibitive duties and decrees existed, the mills of Paisley and Manchester would have been stopped in their outset, and could scarcely have been again set in motion, even by the power of steam.
('41', 420, 2, 9, 779956) They were created by the sacrifice of the Indian manufacture.
('41', 420, 2, 10, 780018) Had India been independent, she would have retaliated, would have imposed prohibitive duties upon British goods, and would thus have preserved her own productive industry from annihilation.
('41', 420, 2, 11, 780208) This act of self defence was not permitted to her; she was at the mercy of the stranger.
('41', 420, 2, 12, 780297) British goods were forced upon her without paying any duty, and the foreign manufacturer employed the arm of political injustice to keep down and ultimately strangle a competitor with whom he could not have contended on equal terms.
('41', 420, 2, 13, 780530) According to Thomas Munro the Companys servants assembled the principal weavers and placed a guard over them until they entered into engagements to supply the Company only. The author then proceeds :
('41', 420, 3, 14, 780730) When once a weaver accepted an advance he seldom got out of his liability.
('41', 420, 3, 15, 780805) A peon was placed over him to quicken his deliveries if he delayed, and he was liable to be prosecuted in the courts of justice.
('41', 420, 3, 16, 780934) The sending of a peon meant a fine of one anna (about 1 1 2 d.) a day on the weaver, and the peon
('41', 420, 4, 17, 781032) was armed with a rattan, which was not unoften used to good purpose.
('41', 420, 4, 18, 781101) Fine was sometimes imposed on the weavers, and their brass utensils were seized for its recovery.
('41', 420, 4, 19, 781199) The whole weaving population of villages were thus held in subjection to the Companys factories.
('41', 420, 4, 20, 781296) The control under which the weaver population was held was not merely a matter of practice, but was legalized by Regulations.
('41', 420, 4, 21, 781422) It was provided that a weaver who had received advances from the Company shall on no account give to any other persons whatever, European or Native, either the labour or the produce engaged to the Company; that on his failing to deliver the stipulate cloths, the Commercial Resident shall be at liberty to place peons upon him in order to quicken his
('41', 421, 0, 1, 781773) 422 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 421, 1, 2, 781815) deliveries; that on his selling his cloths to others, the weaver shall be liable to be prosecuted in the dewani Adalat; that weavers, possessed of more than one loom, and entertaining one or more workmen, shall be subject to a penalty of 35 per cent on the stipulated price of every piece of cloth that they may fail to deliver according to the written agreement; that landlords and tenants are enjoined not to hinder the Commercial Residents or their officers from access to weavers;' and that they are strictly prohibited from behaving with disrespect to the Commercial Residents of the Company.
('41', 421, 1, 3, 782413) Is it to be wondered at if weavers living under such intolerable restraint broke loose from it by cutting off their own thumbs?
('41', 421, 1, 4, 782541) To revive an industry that was thus deliberately destroyed and which supplemented the resources of millions of people is the sacred duty of every Indian who loves his country and should be considered a privilege by every Englishman who would repent of the grave wrong done to a great country by his ancestors.
('41', 421, 1, 5, 782851) But instead of repentance, we see a painful persistence in the policy initiated 150 years ago and an equally painful effort made by every means possible to bolster up the wrong.

('41', 422, 3, 4, 783504) SABARMATI, April 20, 1928
('41', 422, 4, 5, 783530) DEAR MOTILALJI,
('41', 422, 5, 6, 783546) I have your letter.
('41', 422, 5, 7, 783566) I am daily making fresh discoveries which go to show that we may expect nothing from the mill owners at the present stage.
('41', 422, 5, 8, 783689) They will yeild only to pressure and the pressure of the Government is more felt than that of the Congress.
('41', 422, 5, 9, 783797) But we may not be impatient.
('41', 422, 5, 10, 783826) We need not put boycott of Indian mill made cloth in the same category as that of foreign cloth.
('41', 422, 5, 11, 783923) A negative attitude about mill cloth will be quite enough to keep the mills under wholesome check.
('41', 422, 5, 12, 784022) A positive boycott will only stir up bad blood without bringing us any nearer boycott of foreign cloth.
('41', 422, 5, 13, 784126) We shall never, unless a sudden manifestation of mass energy comes into being, succeed in reaching the millions.
('41', 422, 5, 14, 784239) In spite of all we may do, for the time being the latter will therefore be buying Indian mill cloth and, further, there will be keen competition between Lancashire mills and Japanese on the one hand and Indian mills on the other.
('41', 422, 5, 15, 784469) We have therefore to concentrate our effort on changing the mentality of the townspeople and those few villagers whom we are controlling and bringing them round to the adoption of khadi.
('41', 422, 5, 16, 784656) If we set about doing this, the meassage of khadi will percolate the masses.
('41', 422, 5, 17, 784733) Then both our and foreign mills will feel the brunt.
('41', 422, 5, 18, 784786) That will be the time for our mills to come in line with us.
('41', 422, 5, 19, 784847) The moment they do so we can complete boycott of foreign cloth inside of six months.
('41', 422, 5, 20, 784932) The programme definitely therefore has to be this : We leave Indian mills severely alone.
('41', 422, 5, 21, 785022) We carry on a whirl wind compaign for boycott of foreign cloth through khadi, asking people to count no sacrifice too great in adopting khadi.
('41', 422, 5, 22, 785165) We must have faith in ourselves and in our people and believe that they can make this which appears to me to be small sacrifice.
('41', 422, 5, 23, 785294) But I confess that at the present moment I do not visualize the organi zation that is needed to carry on the boycott.
('41', 422, 5, 24, 785412) The politicals who are in possession of the platform do not mean to do any serious business.
('41', 422, 5, 25, 785505) They will not
('41', 423, 0, 1, 785519) 424 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 423, 1, 2, 785561) concentrate on any constructive work.
('41', 423, 1, 3, 785599) Jawahar in a letter truly describes the atmosphere when he says: There is violence in the air. We read and hear so much about the boycott of British cloth in Bengal, but the letters I receive almost every week show that there is no real boycott.
('41', 423, 1, 4, 785845) There is no organization behind it, there is no will working behind it.
('41', 423, 1, 5, 785917) All things considered, what will you advise me to do?
('41', 423, 1, 6, 785971) The expected letter from Romain Rolland is due next Tuesday at the latest.
('41', 423, 1, 7, 786046) I must after that come to a decision quickly.
('41', 423, 1, 8, 786092) Supposing that Romain Rolland predisposes me in favour of the European visit, what would you have me to do in view of the talk of the boycott?
('41', 423, 1, 9, 786235) Would you want me for the sake of the boycott not to go to Europe?
('41', 423, 1, 10, 786302) I shall accept your decision whatever it may be.
('41', 423, 1, 11, 786351) I am not personally keen on the European visit, but if all is plain sailing in India and if Romain Rolland wants me to visit Europe, I should feel bound to accept the European invitations.
('41', 423, 1, 12, 786540) Will you please wire your decision?
('41', 423, 1, 13, 786576) Jawahar will be with you and probably you will know Doctor Ansaris mind.

('41', 423, 7, 19, 786795) I have your letter.
('41', 423, 7, 20, 786815) After having read Revashankerbhais letter, how can I press him to accept the proposal?
('41', 423, 7, 21, 786902) Or do you wish only to use his name and do not expect him to do any work?
('41', 423, 7, 22, 786976) If that is what you wish, then we should find out a temporary vice president who is a good worker.
('41', 423, 7, 23, 787075) It is certainly desirable that you should go to Bombay for all this work.
('41', 423, 7, 24, 787149) Maybe Revashankerbhai could suggest to you in the

('41', 424, 6, 10, 787612) I send you a single sentence as follows : Tolstoys greatest contribution to life lies, in my opinion, in his ever attempting to reduce to practice his professions without counting the cost.
('41', 424, 6, 11, 787802) Thanks for your inquiry about my health.

('41', 426, 3, 4, 789107) BHAISHRI KASTURBHAI 1,
('41', 426, 4, 5, 789130) I do feel a little hesitant in writing this letter to you but Bhai Ambalal is not here and you do know me a little.
('41', 426, 4, 6, 789246) I therefore venture to write to you.
('41', 426, 4, 7, 789283) Enclosed herewith is .
('41', 426, 4, 8, 789306) 2 to Dinabandhu Andrews.
('41', 426, 4, 9, 789331) Talking about that, I told him that all right, I would beg for money from somewhere.
('41', 426, 4, 10, 789416) He had in fact asked for ten thousand rupees.
('41', 426, 4, 11, 789462) Of this, five thousand hewanted for his expenses in Europe.
('41', 426, 4, 12, 789522) I am not very clear about all this.
('41', 426, 4, 13, 789558) Whatever it may be, Birla brothers have paid expenses to Kavivar.
('41', 426, 4, 14, 789624) 3 It seems that that amount will not be enough to accommodate Andrews.
('41', 426, 4, 15, 789695) As far as possible, I do not want to go out of Gujarat to collect money for Andrews.
('41', 426, 4, 16, 789780) Can I approach you with a begging bowl?
('41', 426, 4, 17, 789820) If, for whatever reason, you do not want to give anything, please do not hesitate to say no.
('41', 426, 4, 18, 789913) I consider it my duty to go with a begging bowl wherever I can.
('41', 426, 4, 19, 789977) But it is also my dharma not to feel bad if people refuse to give anything.
('41', 426, 4, 20, 790053) If you feel like saying no, please do say so without any hesitation.

('41', 427, 3, 4, 790446) MY DEAR GANESAN, I have not understood the last paragraph of your letter which I take first, though I understand that you will be unable for some time to bring out Mr. Greggs book.
('41', 427, 3, 5, 790627) It will be terrible if that happens after the long notices that have been taken in Young India of that book.
('41', 427, 3, 6, 790736) Please wire on receipt of this when if at all you are likely to bring the book out.
('41', 427, 3, 7, 790820) You need not apologize for having sent the book on Self Restraint v.

('41', 427, 3, 9, 790920) Indeed having reviewed her books and even advertised them, you were bound to send my book to her.
('41', 427, 3, 10, 791018) There was nothing wrong in it, but you are certainly under no obligation to publish her review of my book, unless of course you independently think that it is a good and well arguedreview.
('41', 427, 3, 11, 791207) And if you do not publish her review, you will be rendering her a service by telling her straightway why you decline to publish it.
('41', 427, 3, 12, 791339) Now about yourself.
('41', 427, 3, 13, 791359) The only thing I can suggest to you is to become absolutely firm about your resolution and you will find that all your difficulties will vanish.
('41', 427, 3, 14, 791504) Our difficulties really arise when we are tossed to and fro by our weakness and indecisive action.
('41', 427, 3, 15, 791603) A decisive, firm, clear action is like the glistening sun which not only dispels all darkness but destroys all disease germs.
('41', 427, 3, 16, 791729) The vast majority of our ills and our difficulties arose from our doubting state.
('41', 427, 3, 17, 791811) I shall have decided about the European visit next week and if I decide to go, it will be somewhere in the middle of May or it may be the first week.
('41', 427, 3, 18, 791961) Do come when you like.
('41', 427, 3, 19, 791984) But before you come try to finish all your announced commitments.

('41', 428, 2, 4, 792297) So you are now president of a Congress Committee.
('41', 428, 2, 5, 792347) This is very good.
('41', 428, 2, 6, 792366) And I am glad that Girdharilal is taking such keen interest in khadi.
('41', 428, 2, 7, 792436) I am forwarding your letter to Sjt.
('41', 428, 2, 8, 792472) Vithaldas Jerajani for attention.
('41', 428, 2, 9, 792506) I quite agree with you that in khadi organizations there should be no indifference, certainly never any cheating.
('41', 428, 2, 10, 792620) I am asking Vithaldas what terms can be offered.
('41', 428, 2, 11, 792669) If you believe in the First Cause, you must regard the why of the First Cause as a futile question.
('41', 428, 2, 12, 792769) Whilst it is laudable and legitimate to bring everything under the dominion of reason we must be humble enough to recognize that there must be things beyond reason, seeing that man is an imperfect being.
('41', 428, 2, 13, 792973) I am glad you are making yourself serviceable all round.
('41', 428, 2, 14, 793030) I entertain no fear about your being lax in the duty entrusted to you.
('41', 428, 2, 15, 793101) I have not been able to decide anything about the European visit.

('41', 430, 10, 14, 794402) Sheth Ranchhodlal Amritlal has sent me the following scheme 5
('41', 430, 11, 15, 794464) of Industrial Insurance for clerks : I understand little of insurance, but I take it that in this age of insurance any scheme of industrial insurance devised for the benefit of the clerical workers would be to their good.
('41', 430, 11, 16, 794686) Only an insurance expert can offer helpful criticism of the scheme, and I take it that Sjt.
('41', 430, 11, 17, 794778) Ranchhodlal has framed the scheme in consultation with some large hearted expert.
('41', 430, 11, 18, 794860) There cannot be two opinions as to the fact that mill owners, no less than other business and commercial firms, ought to take a paternal interest in the welfare of their employees.
('41', 430, 11, 19, 795041) The relations between the employer and the employee have been up to now merely those of the master and servant, they should be of father and children.
('41', 430, 11, 20, 795192) I therefore welcome the scheme.

('41', 431, 1, 2, 795729) Medical relief should not, in my opinion, be free.
('41', 431, 1, 3, 795780) It should be genuine, prompt and cheap.
('41', 431, 1, 4, 795820) Free aid is likely to undermine their independent spirit.
('41', 431, 1, 5, 795878) Sometimes free aid is rendered perfunctorily and sometimes it is abused, from both of which evils the clerks should be saved.
('41', 431, 1, 6, 796004) The main grievance of the clerk and the working man is low pay and indifference to his welfafre.
('41', 431, 1, 7, 796101) The measures suggested in the scheme will be a direct and simple redress of the grievance, and I welcome them.
('41', 431, 1, 8, 796212) The condition of clerks is, in certain respects, undoubtedly much more pitiable.
('41', 431, 1, 9, 796293) I have a vivid picture of their condition before my mind.
('41', 431, 1, 10, 796351) It was given to me in 1915 in Calcutta by the Marwari Clerks Associa tion.
('41', 431, 1, 11, 796426) It was a tragic tale of their helplessness.
('41', 431, 1, 12, 796470) The number of clerks is small, their power of endurance and their capacity for union is feeble.
('41', 431, 1, 13, 796566) Whereas the clerk is the only earning member of his family, practically all the members of the workingmans family are wage earners.
('41', 431, 1, 14, 796698) The clerks must bestir themselves to improve their own condition.
('41', 431, 1, 15, 796764) They must unite, and must educate their dependants, especially their wives, to engage in some gainful occupation.
('41', 431, 1, 16, 796878) They have lost all self confidence and are helpless.
('41', 431, 1, 17, 796931) Those who are honest, competent in their work, conscien tious and hard working need not despair of finding a suitable situation.
('41', 431, 1, 18, 797060) True social economics will teach us that the workingman, the clerk and the employer are parts of the same indivisible organism.
('41', 431, 1, 19, 797188) None is smaller or greater than the other.
('41', 431, 1, 20, 797231) Their interests should be not conflicting but identical and interdependent.

('41', 432, 3, 4, 797442) DEAR MISS KNUDSEN, I was wondering why I have not heard from you for such a long time.
('41', 432, 3, 5, 797529) I am glad you have been having such success in Karachi.
('41', 432, 3, 6, 797585) Owing to the National Week I suspended both the oil massage and your massage, and owing to pressure of work since, I have not been able to resume them.
('41', 432, 3, 7, 797737) But in spite of the suspension I increased nearly two lb.
('41', 432, 3, 8, 797795) in weight.
('41', 432, 3, 9, 797806) As soon as the pressure decreases I hope to recommence massage.

('41', 432, 7, 19, 798205) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, April 22, 1928 You will be perhaps sorry to hear that I have decided not to go to Europe this year.
('41', 432, 7, 20, 798328) There was not call for me to go in answer to the various invitations, but I felt that, if Rolland considered it worth while my going to meet him in furtherance of the common cause, I would go and incidentally respond to invitations from Europe.
('41', 432, 7, 21, 798573) Now there is the expected letter from him.
('41', 432, 7, 22, 798616) I send you a copy so that you can better understand my decision.
('41', 432, 7, 23, 798681) Rollands hesitation to let me go to Europe principally for the sake of meeting him shows that as an artist and as the interpreter of my message he does not regard it as necessary that I should leave all my important work here and go to Europe to meet him.
('41', 432, 7, 24, 798937) And as there is no call in him to ask me to go or to accept my
('41', 433, 0, 1, 799000) 434 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 433, 1, 2, 799042) offer to go, I feel that if my letter to him was truthful, that is to say, if the deciding motive was to see him, I should consider his letter to be Gods guidance in answer to my prayer.
('41', 433, 1, 3, 799229) As days went by I was hardening my heart feeling more reluctant to go to Europe at the present moment and was feeling also that I had nothing to give to Europe, whereas my hands were absolutely full here.
('41', 433, 1, 4, 799434) The call of the Ashram is incessant.
('41', 433, 1, 5, 799471) It is becoming clearer day by day that if I am to do justice to the Ashram, which I claim to be my best creation, and if I cannot give it the whole of my time, I must at least give to it the major part of my time.
('41', 433, 1, 6, 799685) I had Burma in my mind if I did not go to Europe.
('41', 433, 1, 7, 799735) But now I feel that I dont want to go to Burma either and I shall pass the summer in the Ashram, if Burma does not want me.
('41', 433, 1, 8, 799859) The heat does not trouble me.
('41', 433, 1, 9, 799889) I am getting on quite well.
('41', 433, 1, 10, 799917) And, of course, there are many other things which I can attend to if I am here.
('41', 433, 1, 11, 799997) On the whole, therefore, I think that I must not go.
('41', 433, 1, 12, 800050) But I can make this provisional decision that if everything goes well, I would go next year giving myself ample time from now to make all my preparations and dispositions so that I can go without difficulty, and then, perhaps, if I could do so and if the way is clear, taking America also to save time.
('41', 433, 1, 13, 800353) I had a long chat with Ambalal.
('41', 433, 1, 14, 800385) He said that he had sent his own subscription but that he could not move further unless there was a proper balance sheet published.
('41', 433, 1, 15, 800517) He was dissatisfied with the account keeping and he seemed to be keen on a Gujarati committee because he said that the bulk of the money was found by the Gujaratis.
('41', 433, 1, 16, 800682) So far as I could see I could not move him in his decision.
('41', 433, 1, 17, 800742) But he said that in giving his opinion he was more guided by other donors than by his own instinct.
('41', 433, 1, 18, 800842) Marichi described to me the condition of your teeth or rather your toothlessness.
('41', 433, 1, 19, 800924) To be toothless is by no means a great deprivation and it is decidedly a gain when ones teeth are a source of disease rather than of health.
('41', 433, 1, 20, 801065) Remember that you have to finish the Shraddhanand series.
('41', 433, 1, 21, 801123) You should write something on Greggs book.
('41', 433, 1, 22, 801166) I hope Gurudev is much better now.

('41', 435, 3, 4, 801961) CHHAGANLAL,
('41', 435, 4, 5, 801973) Bhai Ramlal is a very good worker.
('41', 435, 4, 6, 802008) He is honest too, but is very short tempered.
('41', 435, 4, 7, 802054) As an atonement for this, I am sending him to you.
('41', 435, 4, 8, 802105) He has to serve you and do all the work you entrust to him.
('41', 435, 4, 9, 802165) He has liked the work.
('41', 435, 4, 10, 802188) If you do not like the arrangement or instead of finding his presence helpful, you find it burdensome, write to me.
('41', 435, 4, 11, 802304) I will call him back.
('41', 435, 4, 12, 802326) As you have difficulty in getting milk and milk products, I am sending pedas 4 from here.
('41', 435, 4, 13, 802416) Do not eat them as pedas but make powder of one or two, add warm water to it and mix it.
('41', 435, 4, 14, 802505) That will become milk and serve its purpose.
('41', 435, 4, 15, 802550) Similarly, soak gol papadi 5 in water, make gruel of the liquid and take it .
('41', 435, 4, 16, 802628) If you like the preparations, ask for the amount you would like to have.
('41', 435, 4, 17, 802701) Do not neglect your health.
('41', 435, 4, 18, 802729) Do not hesitate to write to me about your health and other difficulties.

('41', 436, 2, 3, 802936) Tuesday [Before April 23, 1929] 1
('41', 436, 3, 4, 802970) CHHAGANLAL,
('41', 436, 4, 5, 802982) I have received your telegrams.
('41', 436, 4, 6, 803014) Knowing you well, I was not at all upset by your telegram.
('41', 436, 4, 7, 803073) The other telegrams proved your faith right.
('41', 436, 4, 8, 803118) As long as I am destined to take work from you, no harm will come to you.
('41', 436, 4, 9, 803192) I personally feel that you should not leave Utkal.
('41', 436, 4, 10, 803243) I would not like you to leave the place after falling ill.
('41', 436, 4, 11, 803302) Many old priests live there.
('41', 436, 4, 12, 803331) Where could they go?
('41', 436, 4, 13, 803352) We belong to the place as much as we belong to the Ashram or Rajkot.
('41', 436, 4, 14, 803421) After improving your health in Calcutta, if you feel strong enough to go back, do so.
('41', 436, 4, 15, 803507) I have sent Ramlalji with that hope.
('41', 436, 4, 16, 803544) Do not feel self conscious unnecessarily, ask for the facilities you need, look after your health and render service.
('41', 436, 4, 17, 803662) However, these are my views.
('41', 436, 4, 18, 803691) Do what you want and what is within your power.
('41', 436, 4, 19, 803739) My duty is to encourage you and your duty is to imbibe from it what you can.
('41', 436, 4, 20, 803816) There is so much to write but where is the time?

('41', 437, 2, 3, 804276) [Before April 23, 1928] 1
('41', 437, 3, 4, 804302) RADHIKA,
('41', 437, 4, 5, 804311) I understand your condition from your letters to me and to others which they give me to read.
('41', 437, 4, 6, 804405) Everybody will feel reassured if you keep on writing like this.
('41', 437, 4, 7, 804469) I have received letters from Bhai Ramnandan also in which he says he will take proper care of you.
('41', 437, 4, 8, 804568) There is a letter from Brij Kishore Babu from Patna, in which also he says that he will go to your village 2 and arrange everything.
('41', 437, 4, 9, 804701) You have to show courage.
('41', 437, 4, 10, 804727) You should not, therefore, be disheartened by difficulties but should overcome them with patience and bear those that cannot be overcome.
('41', 437, 4, 11, 804865) Do let me know of even the smallest difficulty.
('41', 437, 4, 12, 804913) You must not lose heart.
('41', 437, 4, 13, 804938) One of the purposes in sending you out is that you should have some experience of the world and be tested by it.
('41', 437, 4, 14, 805051) We may also in this way have a measure of our strength and weakness.
('41', 437, 4, 15, 805120) In this vast land of ours there are countless ways of living and all kinds of hardships.
('41', 437, 4, 16, 805209) We have to live in the midst of all this and reform things wherever there is scope for reform; look at the thing in this light.
('41', 437, 4, 17, 805337) Nothing is decided as yet about my going to England.

('41', 437, 7, 21, 805498) It must have been written before the addressees return to the Ashram following the death of her father Maganlal Gandhi at Patna on April 23, 1928 2 The addressee had gone to Bihar to teach a Bihari girl.

('41', 438, 2, 4, 805933) Radha is there by chance.
('41', 438, 2, 5, 805959) The friends at Patna are doing their best for him.
('41', 438, 2, 6, 806010) Any moment there may be a telegram about his passing away.
('41', 438, 2, 7, 806069) What mystery of Gods will is this, that he whom I regard as my heir is preparing to go away, leaving his inheritance?
('41', 438, 2, 8, 806187) If only all of you who remain behind could follow in Maganlals footsteps!
('41', 438, 2, 9, 806261) I get the letters of both of you.
('41', 438, 2, 10, 806295) Wayne must have given you my message.
('41', 438, 2, 11, 806333) I think I have already informed you that he met me.
('41', 438, 2, 12, 806385) Ramdas is still in Kathiawar hawking khadi.
('41', 438, 2, 13, 806429) He should return in four or five days.
('41', 438, 2, 14, 806468) Chhaganlal fell ill and has, therefore, left Orissa and gone to Almora.
('41', 438, 2, 15, 806540) Prabhudas is already there on grounds of health.
('41', 438, 2, 16, 806589) But now he is doing khadi work all the time.
('41', 438, 2, 17, 806634) I want a sample of Sushilas English handwriting and language.
('41', 438, 2, 18, 806696) What is her weight now?
('41', 438, 2, 19, 806720) What painting is she engaged on at present?
('41', 438, 2, 20, 806764) If Sorabji spends beyond his means, do not forget your duty, as a friend, of restraining him.
('41', 438, 2, 21, 806858) Never take advantage of his spend thrift nature.
('41', 438, 2, 22, 806907) Always remain within the bounds of propriety.
('41', 438, 2, 23, 806953) I have dropped for the present the idea of going to Europe.

('41', 442, 3, 5, 809362) Consider with Jaisukhlal what should be done if the work at Balara stops.
('41', 442, 3, 6, 809436) I did not understand your intention in the last paragraph.
('41', 442, 3, 7, 809495) If however you have an offer of a better paid job and you feel inclined to accept it, I will not force you to remain in the khadi work.
('41', 442, 3, 8, 809631) If you remain in khadi work, you should do so merely in a spirit of service an without any thought of money, as Ramdas does.
('41', 442, 3, 9, 809756) No one should feel that he is acting under coercion from anyone.
('41', 442, 3, 10, 809821) I certainly like your work.
('41', 442, 3, 11, 809849) Personally, I should like to keep you in the Ashram.
('41', 442, 3, 12, 809902) But a proposal is under discussion just now that only those who observe brahmacharya should be allowed to live in the Ashram.
('41', 442, 3, 13, 810028) Nothing has been decided finally.
('41', 442, 3, 14, 810062) But I believe that there would be no difficulty in fixing you up at some other place if not in the Ashram.

('41', 443, 2, 3, 810376) SANTOK, Seth Ghanshyamdas Birla is willing to employ Keshu, so you need not worry now about him.
('41', 443, 2, 4, 810473) God will certainly ensure that he prospers.
('41', 443, 2, 5, 810517) All of you should get absorbed in work.
('41', 443, 2, 6, 810557) Take care of your health.

('41', 443, 7, 12, 810766) NARANDAS, I have received all your three letters.
('41', 443, 7, 13, 810816) l am unhappy that you are so very unhappy.
('41', 443, 7, 14, 810859) Till today, I never worried on your account.
('41', 443, 7, 15, 810904) I had assumed that you would neither feel hurt nor would misunderstand me.
('41', 443, 7, 16, 810979) Now you have felt a little hurt.
('41', 443, 7, 17, 811012) I assume that it will only be momentary.
('41', 443, 7, 18, 811053) About Radha and Santok, do as you think best.
('41', 443, 7, 19, 811099) I withdraw my opposition.
('41', 443, 7, 20, 811125) I have sent two letters to that effect to Chhaganlal regarding Santok and Radha.
('41', 443, 7, 21, 811206) I have written to him about Sanabhai also.
('41', 443, 7, 22, 811249) I have also asked him why, after deciding to keep him, he changed his mind.
('41', 443, 7, 23, 811325) You may pour out all your sufferings to me but never lose your self possession.
('41', 443, 7, 24, 811405) I do not have more time today.

('41', 444, 2, 3, 811937) Tuesday [After April 23, 1928] 1
('41', 444, 3, 4, 811970) CHHAGANLAL, What shall I write to you?
('41', 444, 3, 5, 812009) Improve your health.
('41', 444, 3, 6, 812030) There is no urgency for going to Utkal.
('41', 444, 3, 7, 812070) Whenever you decide to go, do see me before going.
('41', 444, 3, 8, 812121) Kashi herself, at the moment, does not feel strong enough to go there.
('41', 444, 3, 9, 812192) Both of us believe that she will not be able to bear the cold there.
('41', 444, 3, 10, 812261) I am touched by your beautiful letter to Joshi.
('41', 444, 3, 11, 812309) The very next day of [Maganlals] death, I started a movement that Santok should give away whatever property she has.
('41', 444, 3, 12, 812426) I had talked about it to Maganlal many a time.
('41', 444, 3, 13, 812473) I have started the move with the help of Keshu.
('41', 444, 3, 14, 812521) While talking to Khushalbhai about the shradha 2, I asked him to do the same.
('41', 444, 3, 15, 812599) I could not talk to him at length as there was some distraction.
('41', 444, 3, 16, 812664) However, on this matter, I solicit the help of all you brothers.
('41', 444, 3, 17, 812729) The property is meant for all of you but none of you need it.
('41', 444, 3, 18, 812791) Then why should you keep it?
('41', 444, 3, 19, 812820) I will no doubt talk to Narandas too.
('41', 444, 3, 20, 812858) I remember that you too have something with you.
('41', 444, 3, 21, 812907) I wish that you would dispose it off.
('41', 444, 3, 22, 812945) For whom do you need it?
('41', 444, 3, 23, 812970) Both your sons are able and of self sacrificing temperament.
('41', 444, 3, 24, 813031) Kashi and you will never be in trouble.
('41', 444, 3, 25, 813071) The thought as to what will happen to the Ashram when I am no more, is a mean one and should never be entertained.
('41', 444, 3, 26, 813186) I have written all this in a great hurry.

('41', 446, 3, 4, 814576) MY DEAR JAWAHAR, I have your letter.
('41', 446, 3, 5, 814613) Of course you know already the calamity that has befallen me on the death of Maganlal.
('41', 446, 3, 6, 814700) It is well nigh unbearable.
('41', 446, 3, 7, 814728) However I am putting on a brave front.
('41', 446, 3, 8, 814767) I had not read the resolution asking the Congress to drop peaceful and legitimate means and change the expression into by all possible means.
('41', 446, 3, 9, 814909) Independence I can swallow, by all means is unswallowable.
('41', 446, 3, 10, 814968) But I suppose we shall have to develop stomach strong enough to swallow any poison.
('41', 446, 3, 11, 815052) I hope however that you will not allow yourself to be exploited beyond your wish and capacity.
('41', 446, 3, 12, 815147) The mill owners, it has now become obviously clear, wanted to do a deal with the Congress.
('41', 446, 3, 13, 815238) But I am not sorry for these abortive negotiations.
('41', 446, 3, 14, 815290) They have cleared the atmosphere.
('41', 446, 3, 15, 815324) The expected letter from Romain Rolland was received on Sunday.
('41', 446, 3, 16, 815388) He will not bear the burden I wanted him to do.
('41', 446, 3, 17, 815436) So I am not going this year.
('41', 446, 3, 18, 815465) But you will read about this in the pages of Young India.

('41', 447, 4, 7, 815842) They have got to be brave, if they will not become worse than purdanusheens 1. For those who will have the butterfly existence are, in my opinion, worse than purdanusheens.
('41', 447, 4, 8, 816015) And those who will become real servants of the nation have to accept voluntarily poverty as a blessing and not a mere tolerable position.

('41', 449, 7, 9, 817269) 524. MY BEST COMRADE GONE He whom I had singled out as heir to my all is no more.
('41', 449, 7, 10, 817351) Maganlal K. Gandhi, a grandson of an uncle of mine had been with me in my work since 1904. Maganlals father has given all his boys to the cause.
('41', 449, 7, 11, 817496) The deceased went early this month to Bengal with Seth Jamnalalji and others, contracted a high fever whilst he was on duty in Bihar and died under the protecting care of Brijkishore Prasad in Patna after an illness of nine days and after receiving all the devoted nursing that love and skill could give.
('41', 449, 7, 12, 817801) Maganlal Gandhi went with me to South Africa in 1903 in the hope of making a bit of fortune.
('41', 449, 7, 13, 817894) But hardly had he been store keeping for one year, when he responded to my sudden call to self imposed poverty, joined the Phoenix settlement and never once faltered or failed after so joining me.
('41', 449, 7, 14, 818091) If he had not dedicated himself to the countrys service, his undoubted abilities and indefatigable industry would have made him a merchant prince.
('41', 449, 7, 15, 818238) Put in a printing press he easily and quickly mastered the secrets of the art of printing.
('41', 449, 7, 16, 818329) Though he had never before handled a tool or a machine, he found himself at home in the engine room, the machine room and at the compositors desk.
('41', 449, 7, 17, 818476) He was equally at ease with the Gujarati editing of the Indian Opinion.
('41', 449, 7, 18, 818548) Since the Phoenix scheme included domestic farming, he became a good farmer.
('41', 449, 7, 19, 818625) His was I think the best garden at the settlement.
('41', 449, 7, 20, 818676) It may be of interest to note that the very first issue of Young India published in Ahmedabad bears the marks of his labours when they were much needed.
('41', 449, 8, 21, 818829) 1 This was sent in reply to the following telegram from C. Rajagopalachari: Jamnalalji gone Patna.
('41', 449, 8, 22, 818928) Returning tomorrow.
('41', 449, 8, 23, 818948) You may resent suggestion but prayerfully press your going Europe now leaving scene of desolation in Jamnalaljis hands who must postpone pilgrimage remain Ashram.
('41', 449, 8, 24, 819111) Wire reply Martaluminium.
('41', 450, 0, 1, 819137) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 451
('41', 450, 1, 2, 819179) He had a sturdy constitution which he wore away in advancing the cause to which he had dedicated himself.
('41', 450, 1, 3, 819285) He closely studied and followed my spiritual career and when I presented to my co workers brahmacharya as a rule of life even for married men in search of Truth, he was the first to perceive the beauty and the necessity of the practice and, though it cost him to my knowledge a terrific struggle, he carried it through to success, taking his wife along with him by patient argument instead of imposing his views on her.
('41', 450, 1, 4, 819705) When satyagraha was born, he was in the forefront.
('41', 450, 1, 5, 819756) He gave me the expression which I was striving to find to give its full meaning to what the South African struggle stood for, and which for want of a better term I allowed to be recognized by the very insufficient and even misleading term passive resistance.
('41', 450, 1, 6, 820015) I wish I had the very beautiful letter he then wrote to me giving his reasons for suggesting the name U which I changed to U. 1 He argued out the whole philosophy of the struggle step by step and brought the reader irresistibly to his chosen name.
('41', 450, 1, 7, 820263) The letter I remember was incredibly short and to the point as all his communications always were.
('41', 450, 1, 8, 820362) During the struggle he was never weary of work, shirked no task and by his intrepidity he infected everyone around him with courage and hope.
('41', 450, 1, 9, 820504) When everyone went to jail, when at Phoenix courting imprisonment was like a prize to be won at my instance, he stayed back in order to shoulder a much heavier task.
('41', 450, 1, 10, 820670) He sent his wife to join the womens party.
('41', 450, 1, 11, 820713) On our return to India, it was he again who made it possible to found the Ashram in the austere manner in which it was founded.
('41', 450, 1, 12, 820841) Here he was called to a newer and more difficult task.
('41', 450, 1, 13, 820896) He proved equal to it.
('41', 450, 1, 14, 820919) Untouchability was a very severe trial for him.
('41', 450, 1, 15, 820967) Just for one brief moment his heart seemed to give way.
('41', 450, 1, 16, 821023) But it was only for a second.
('41', 450, 1, 17, 821053) He saw that love had no bounds and that it was necessary to live down the ways of untouchables, if only because the so called higher castes were responsible for them.
('41', 450, 1, 18, 821220) The mechanical department of the Ashram was not a continuation of the Phoenix activity.
('41', 450, 1, 19, 821308) Here we had to learn weaving, spinning, carding, and ginning.
('41', 450, 1, 20, 821370) Again I turned to Maganlal.
('41', 450, 1, 21, 821398) Though the conception was mine, his were the hands to reduce it to execution.
('41', 450, 1, 22, 821476) He learnt weaving and all the other processes that cotton had to go through before it became khadi.
('41', 450, 1, 23, 821576) He was a born mechanic.
('41', 450, 2, 24, 821600) 1 Vide Satyagraha in South Africa (Chapter XII: The Advent of Satyagraha).
('41', 451, 0, 1, 821675) 452 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 451, 1, 2, 821717) When dairying was introduced in the Ashram he threw himself with zeal in the work, studied dairy literature, named every cow and became friends with every animal 1 on the settlement.
('41', 451, 1, 3, 821900) And when tannery was added, he was undaunted and had proposed to learn the principles of tanning as soon as he got a little breathing time.
('41', 451, 1, 4, 822040) Apart from his scholastic training in the High School at Rajkot, he learnt the many things he knew so well in the school of hard experience.
('41', 451, 1, 5, 822181) He gathered knowledge from village carpenters, village weavers, farmers, shepherds and such ordinary folk.
('41', 451, 1, 6, 822288) He was the Director of the Technical Department of the Spin ners Association, and during the recent floods in Gujarat, Vallabh bhai put him in charge of building the new township Vithalpur.
('41', 451, 1, 7, 822478) He was an exemplary father.
('41', 451, 1, 8, 822506) He trained his childrenone boy and two girls, all unmarried stillso as to make them fit for dedication to the country.
('41', 451, 1, 9, 822625) His son Keshu is showing very great ability in mechanical engineering, all of which he has picked up like his father from seeing ordinary carpenters and smiths at work.
('41', 451, 1, 10, 822794) His eldest daughter Radha, eighteen years old, recently shouldered a difficult and delicate mission to Bihar in the interest of womens freedom.
('41', 451, 1, 11, 822938) Indeed he had a good grasp of what national education should be and often engaged the teachers in earnest and critical discussion over it.
('41', 451, 1, 12, 823077) Let not the reader imagine that he knew nothing of politics.
('41', 451, 1, 13, 823138) He did, but he chose the path of silent, selfless constructive service.
('41', 451, 1, 14, 823210) He was my hands, my feet and my eyes.
('41', 451, 1, 15, 823248) The world knows so little of how much my so called greatness depends upon the incessant toil and drudgery of silent, devoted, able and pure workers, men as well as women.
('41', 451, 1, 16, 823419) And among them all Maganlal was to me the greatest, the best and the purest.
('41', 451, 1, 17, 823496) As I am penning these lines, I hear the sobs of the widow bewailing the death of her dear husband.
('41', 451, 1, 18, 823595) Little does she realize that I am more widowed than she.
('41', 451, 1, 19, 823652) And but for a living faith in God, I should become a raving maniac for the loss of one who was dearer to me than my own sons, who never once deceived me or failed me, who was a personification of industry, who was the watchdog of the Ashram in all its aspectsmaterial, moral and spiritual.
('41', 451, 1, 20, 823942) His life is an inspiration for me, a standing demonstration of the efficacy and the supremacy of the moral law.
('41', 451, 1, 21, 824054) In his own life he proved visibly for me

('41', 452, 2, 5, 824511) 525. A MORAL STRUGGLE
('41', 452, 3, 6, 824533) I am a husband aged 30. My wife is about the same age.
('41', 452, 3, 7, 824588) We have five children, of which two are fortunately dead.
('41', 452, 3, 8, 824646) I know the responsibility for the rest of our children.
('41', 452, 3, 9, 824702) But I find it difficult, if not impossible, to discharge that responsibility.
('41', 452, 3, 10, 824780) You have advised self restraint.
('41', 452, 3, 11, 824813) Well, I have practised it for the last three years, but that is very much against my partners wish.
('41', 452, 3, 12, 824913) She insists on what poor mortals call the joys of life.
('41', 452, 3, 13, 824969) You from your superior height may call it a sin.
('41', 452, 3, 14, 825018) But my partner does not see it in that light.
('41', 452, 3, 15, 825064) Nor is she afraid of bearing more children to me.
('41', 452, 3, 16, 825114) She has not the sense of responsibility that I flatter myself with the belief I have.
('41', 452, 3, 17, 825200) My parents side more with my wife than with me and there are daily quarrels.
('41', 452, 3, 18, 825277) The denial of satisfaction to my wife has made her so peevish and so irritable that she flares up on the slightest pretext.
('41', 452, 3, 19, 825401) My problem now is how to solve the difficulty.
('41', 452, 3, 20, 825448) The children I have are too many for me.
('41', 452, 3, 21, 825489) I am too poor to support them.
('41', 452, 3, 22, 825520) The wife seems utterly irreconcilable.
('41', 452, 3, 23, 825559) If she does not have the satisfaction she demands, she may even go astray or go mad or commit suicide.
('41', 452, 3, 24, 825662) I tell you, sometimes I feel that if the law of the land permitted it, I would shoot down all unwanted children as you would stray dogs.
('41', 452, 3, 25, 825799) For the last three months I have gone without the second meal, without tiffin.
('41', 452, 3, 26, 825878) I have business obligation which prevent me from fasting for days.
('41', 452, 3, 27, 825945) I get no compassion from the wife because she cosiders I am a humbug.
('41', 452, 3, 28, 826015) I know the literature on birth control.
('41', 452, 3, 29, 826055) It is temptingly written.
('41', 452, 3, 30, 826081) And I have read your book on self restraint.
('41', 452, 3, 31, 826126) I find myself between the devil and the deep blue sea.
('41', 452, 4, 32, 826181) The foregoing is a faithful paraphrase of a heart rending letter from a young man who has given me his full name and address and whom I have known for some years.
('41', 452, 4, 33, 826344) Being afraid to give his name, he
('41', 453, 0, 1, 826378) 454 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 453, 1, 2, 826420) tells me he wrote twice before anonymously hoping that I would deal with his communications in the pages of Young India.
('41', 453, 1, 3, 826541) I receive so many anonymous letters of this type that I hesitate to deal with them, even as I have considerable hesitation in dealing with this letter, although I know it to be perfectly genuine and know it to be a letter from a striving soul.
('41', 453, 1, 4, 826785) The subject matter is so delicate.
('41', 453, 1, 5, 826820) But I see that I may not shirk an obvious duty claiming as I do claim a fair amount of experience of such cases and more especially because my method has given relief in several similar cases.
('41', 453, 1, 6, 827013) The condition in India, so far as English educated Indians are concerned, is doubly difficult.
('41', 453, 1, 7, 827108) The gulf between husband and wife from the point of view of social attainments is almost too wide to be bridgeable.
('41', 453, 1, 8, 827224) Some young men seem to think that they have solved it satisfactorily by simply throwing their wives overboard, although they know that in their caste there is no divorce possible and therefore no remarriage on the part of their wives possible.
('41', 453, 1, 9, 827468) Yet othersand this is the far more numerous classuse their wives merely as vehicles of enjoyment without sharing their intellectual life with them.
('41', 453, 1, 10, 827616) A very small numberbut daily growinghas a quickened conscience and are faced with the moral difficulty such as my correspondent is faced with.
('41', 453, 1, 11, 827759) In my opinion, sexual union to be legitimate is permissible only when both the parties desire it.
('41', 453, 1, 12, 827857) I do not recognize the right of either partner to compel satisfaction.
('41', 453, 1, 13, 827928) And if my position is correct in the case in point, there is no more obligation on the part of the husband to yield to the wifes importunities.
('41', 453, 1, 14, 828072) But this refusal at once throws a much greater and more exalted responsibility on the husbands shoulders.
('41', 453, 1, 15, 828178) He will not look down upon his wife from his isolent height but will humbly recognize that what to him is not a necessity is to her a fundamental necessity.
('41', 453, 1, 16, 828335) He will therefore treat her with the utmost gentleness and love and will have confidence in his own purity to transmute his partners passion into energy of the highest type.
('41', 453, 1, 17, 828509) He will therefore have to become her real friend, guide and physician.
('41', 453, 1, 18, 828580) He will have to give her his fullest confidence and with inexhaustible patience explain to her the moral basis of his action, the true nature of the relationship that should subsist between husband and wife and the true meaning of marriage.
('41', 453, 1, 19, 828821) He will find in the process that many things that were not clear to him before will be clear and he will draw his partner closer to him if his own restraint is truthful.
('41', 453, 1, 20, 828991) In the case in point I cannot help saying that the desire not to
('41', 454, 0, 1, 829056) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 455
('41', 454, 1, 2, 829098) have more children is not enough reason for refusing satisfaction.
('41', 454, 1, 3, 829165) It appears almost cowardly to reject ones wifes advances merely for fear of having to support children.
('41', 454, 1, 4, 829269) A check upon an unlimited increase in the family is a good ground for both the parties jointly and individually putting a restraint upon sexual desires, but it is not sufficient warrant for one to refuse the privileges of a common bed to the other.
('41', 454, 1, 5, 829518) And why this impatience of children?
('41', 454, 1, 6, 829555) Surely there is enough scope for honest, hard working and intelligent men to earn enough for a reasonable number of children.
('41', 454, 1, 7, 829681) I admit that for one like my correspondent who is honestly trying to devote his whole time to the service of the country it is difficult to support a large and growing family and at the same time to serve a country, millions of whose children are semi starved.
('41', 454, 1, 8, 829942) I have often expressed the opinion in these pages that it is wrong to bring forth progeny in India so long as she is in bondage.
('41', 454, 1, 9, 830071) But that is a very good reason for young men and young women to abstain from marriage, not a conclusive reason for one partner refusing sexual co operation to the other.
('41', 454, 1, 10, 830241) That co operation can be lawfully refused, it is a duty to refuse, when the call for brahmacharya on the highest ground of pure religion is imperative.
('41', 454, 1, 11, 830393) And when such a call has clearly come, it will have its healthy reaction upon the partner.
('41', 454, 1, 12, 830484) Assuming, however, that it does not produce such reaction in time, it will still be a duty to adhere to restraint even at the risk of losinng the life or the sanity of ones partner.
('41', 454, 1, 13, 830666) The cause of brahmacharya demands sacrifices no less heroic than, say, the cause of Truth or of ones country.
('41', 454, 1, 14, 830776) In view of what I have said above, it is hardly necessary to state that artificial control of births is an immoral practice having no place in the conception of life that underlies my argument.

('41', 455, 1, 2, 831035) 526. TO EUROPEAN FRIENDS
('41', 455, 2, 3, 831060) It is not without deep sorrow that I am now able to announce that the much talked of visit of mine to Europe is not to come off this year at any rate.
('41', 455, 2, 4, 831211) To those in Austria, Holland, England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Russia who had sent me kind invitations I can only say that their disappointment will be no greater than mine.
('41', 455, 2, 5, 831400) Somehow or other I dread a visit to Europe and America.
('41', 455, 2, 6, 831456) Not that I distrust the peoples of these great Continents any more than I distrust my own, but I distrust myself.
('41', 455, 2, 7, 831570) I have no desire to go to the West in search of health or for sightseeing.
('41', 455, 2, 8, 831645) I have no desire to deliver pubic speeches.
('41', 455, 2, 9, 831689) I detest being lionized.
('41', 455, 2, 10, 831714) I wonder if I shall ever again have the health to stand the awful strain of public speaking and public demonstrations.
('41', 455, 2, 11, 831833) If God ever sent me to the West, I should go there to penetrate the hearts of the masses, to have quiet talks with the youth of the West and have the privilege of meeting kindred spiritslovers of peace at any price save that of Truth.
('41', 455, 2, 12, 832068) But I feel that I have as yet no message to deliver personally to the West.
('41', 455, 2, 13, 832144) I believe my message to be universal but as yet I feel that I can best deliver it through my work in my own country.
('41', 455, 2, 14, 832261) If I can show visible success in India, the delivery of the message becomes complete.
('41', 455, 2, 15, 832347) If I came to the conclusion that India had no use for my message, I should not care to go elsewhere in search of listeners even though I still retained faith in it.
('41', 455, 2, 16, 832512) If, therefore, I ventured out of India, I should do so because I have faith, though I cannot demonstrate it to the satisfaction of all, that the message is being surely received by India be it ever so slowly.
('41', 455, 2, 17, 832721) Thus whilst I was hesitatingly carrying on the correspondence with friends who had invited me, I saw that there was need for me to go to Europe, if only to see M. Romain Rolland.
('41', 455, 2, 18, 832900) Owing to my distrust of myself over a general visit, I wanted to make my visit to that wise man of the West the primary cause of my journey to Europe.
('41', 455, 2, 19, 833051) I therefore referred my difficulty to him and asked him in the frankest manner possible whether he would let me make my desire to meet him the primary cause of my visit to Europe.
('41', 455, 2, 20, 833231) In reply I have a noble letter from him through Mirabai (Miss Slade) wherein he says that in the
('41', 456, 0, 1, 833328) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 457
('41', 456, 1, 2, 833370) name of truth itself, he will not think of letting me go to Europe if a visit to him is to be the primary cause.
('41', 456, 1, 3, 833483) He will not let me interrupt my labours here for the sake of our meeting.
('41', 456, 1, 4, 833557) I read in his letter no false humility.
('41', 456, 1, 5, 833597) I read in it a most genuine expression of truth.
('41', 456, 1, 6, 833646) He knew when he wrote his reply that my desire to go to Europe to meet him was not for a mere courteous discussion but in the interest of the cause as dear to him as to me.
('41', 456, 1, 7, 833819) But evidently he was too humble to bear the burden of calling me merely so that in furtherance of the common interest we might by mutual talks understand each other better.
('41', 456, 1, 8, 833992) And I wanted him to shoulder that very burden, if he felt that truth required us to meet each other face to face.
('41', 456, 1, 9, 834106) His reply therefore I have taken as a clear answer to my prayer.
('41', 456, 1, 10, 834171) Apart from this visit, I felt within me no imperative call.
('41', 456, 1, 11, 834231) I have taken the public into my confidence as, against my wish, the fact that a visit to Europe during this season was under serious contemplation was published in the papers.
('41', 456, 1, 12, 834407) I regret my decision but it seems to be the correct one.
('41', 456, 1, 13, 834464) For whilst there is no urge within to go to Europe, there is an incessant call within for so much to do here.
('41', 456, 1, 14, 834574) And now the death of my best comrade seems to keep me rooted to the Ashram.
('41', 456, 1, 15, 834650) But I my say to the many friends in Europe, that next year, if all is well and if they still will have me I shall try to undertake the postponed tour, under the strict limitations mentioned by me and this I shall do whether I am ready to deliver my message or not.
('41', 456, 1, 16, 834915) To see my numerous friends face to face will be no small privilege.
('41', 456, 1, 17, 834983) But let me conclude this personal explanation by saying that if ever I am privileged to visit the West, I shall go there without changing my dress or habits, save in so far as the climate may require a change and self imposed restrictions may permit.
('41', 456, 1, 18, 835234) My outward form is I hope an expression of the inward.

('41', 457, 2, 4, 835676) Where the wheel is reported to have failed, it was not the wheel that failed, but the wheel mesters that failed because they had no faith.
('41', 457, 2, 5, 835815) Schoolboy all the world over will respond to honest endeavour as the boys of the Sasavane Ashram have done.
('41', 457, 2, 6, 835923) And from the figures that are published from time to time in these columns, anyone who cares can work out an arithmetical calculation showing how many children working, say, at least one hour per day at the weel or the takli can spin enough yarn to clothe the whole nation.

('41', 460, 2, 4, 838992) It is perhaps the greatest trial of my life.
('41', 460, 2, 5, 839037) But so far it appears that He who has subjected me to the ordeal is giving me the strength to go through it.
('41', 460, 2, 6, 839146) Now therefore to the business.
('41', 460, 2, 7, 839177) Here are copies of cables ex changed between Sastri and myself.
('41', 460, 2, 8, 839241) Please tell me if I have erred anywhere in my reply.
('41', 460, 2, 9, 839294) And if you have got the papers refer red to by Sastri in his cable of date after my departure from South Africa after July 1914, please send them to me by registered post, especially the arrangements of 1915 and the recent bill.

('41', 460, 6, 14, 839643) MY DEAR GANESAN, Here is the preface 1 to the History of Satyagraha in South Africa.
('41', 460, 6, 15, 839728) Desai is anxious that you should send a proof copy of the whole book, cover and all, as it is to be issued, and that this you should do before finishing the binding of all copies.
('41', 460, 6, 16, 839908) He tells me that whoever looks after the printing in your office, is extremely careless and tells me sometimes important corrections made by him have not been carried out.
('41', 460, 6, 17, 840080) He is anxious that such mistakes should be avoided for this book.
('41', 460, 6, 18, 840146) I have already telegraphed 2 to you that you may dedicate it to Maganlal Gandhi.
('41', 460, 7, 19, 840227) 1 This appears to be a slip for foreword 2 The telegram is not available.

('41', 461, 1, 4, 840469) But if I can do it in some other way, I would gladly adopt it.
('41', 461, 1, 5, 840532) There is a way, perhaps, of taking Mr. Greggs book off your hands.

('41', 461, 6, 13, 840840) I delayed sending the other pamphlets pending the publication of Mr. Greggs volume.
('41', 461, 6, 14, 840924) The other pamphlets represent the conclusions of two very well known lawyers of Madras and Bihar.
('41', 461, 6, 15, 841022) You were good enough to say that when you had more leisure you would like to discuss the potency of khadi with me.

('41', 462, 3, 4, 841538) DEAR MR. PETIT, Whilst I was thinking of applying to you for a contribution for the expenses I am incurring in connection with the position of emigrants abroad, I received a long confidential cablegram from the Rt.
('41', 462, 3, 5, 841753) Sastri to which I have been obliged to send a reply which has cost me Rs.92 4 0. I do not know how prolonged this cable correspondence will be.
('41', 462, 3, 6, 841897) Whilst I have not Mr. Banarsidas with me, I have Pandit Totaram Sanadhya of Fiji, whom I dare say you know at least by repute.
('41', 462, 3, 7, 842024) He is staying at the Ashram with his wife.
('41', 462, 3, 8, 842067) He is draw ing regularly Rs. 50, and he is allowed to incur extra expenses in connection with Fiji.
('41', 462, 3, 9, 842167) All the expenses are kept and even accounts are published.
('41', 462, 3, 10, 842226) I send you a copy herewith.
('41', 462, 3, 11, 842254) Totaramji gives his spare time to teaching Hindi to the children in the Ashram.
('41', 462, 3, 12, 842334) I would like the Association 1 to take this burden off my shoulders.
('41', 462, 3, 13, 842403) If the Association would not care to bear the whole of the honorarium paid to Totaramji, it may halve with me.
('41', 462, 3, 14, 842514) I send you also the account published by Totaramji of his work and issued for private circulation.
('41', 462, 3, 15, 842613) I am managing all the expenses connected with Ashram activities through the generosity of private friends, but I think that the expenses on account of activity in connection with the emigrants should be borne by the Association.
('41', 462, 3, 16, 842842) I would therefore like you to consider this letter as if it was divided into two parts, the first with reference to the general expenses which in my books amount to roughly Rs. 5,000 to date.
('41', 462, 3, 17, 843034) I could send you an extract from the Ashram ledger to show how the account is made up,secondly, the expenses that I am now incurring regarding cables.
('41', 462, 3, 18, 843185) I shall be thankful for whatever the Committee of the Association considers a legitimate charge upon its funds.

('41', 463, 7, 9, 843746) THE ASHRAM, SABARMATI, April 27, 1928
('41', 463, 8, 10, 843784) MY DEAR JUGALKISHORE, I was glad to receive your letter after such a long absence.
('41', 463, 8, 11, 843867) I was wondering how you were faring at the P. M. V. 1
('41', 463, 9, 12, 843921) My plan about the spinners register is not half as ambitious as you think, though we cannot be too accurate nor too insistent on every worker coming in the closest touch with the spinners and yet, strange as it may appear though we represent spinners above everybody else, our workers are least in touch with them!
('41', 463, 9, 13, 844236) But even if we do not come in such close contact with them and understand their lives as we understand our blood sisters, we should at least know who and where they are, who are supplying us with their yarn.
('41', 463, 9, 14, 844444) I have therefore said that we should trace the residence and names of every spinner whose yarn is received in the bazaar.
('41', 463, 9, 15, 844566) Let us at least have that very rudimentary contact with them.
('41', 463, 9, 16, 844628) This does not require the elaborate register mentioned by Satis Babu in his Manual.
('41', 463, 9, 17, 844712) Even he is not able to enforce that register when he buys yarn at the Feni Bazaar.
('41', 463, 9, 18, 844795) His register was and is in complete operation at his Atrai Dept.
('41', 463, 9, 19, 844860) where he brought into being the spinners for the first time and kept touch with them.
('41', 463, 9, 20, 844946) The largest quantity of yarn however received by him is at

('41', 464, 1, 2, 845068) the Feni Bazaar.
('41', 464, 1, 3, 845085) My register therefore is really a census register to be taken once for all or periodically.
('41', 464, 1, 4, 845177) You see therefore you do not require the staff suggested by you for my simple measure.
('41', 464, 1, 5, 845264) Nobody has complained that the Gandhi Ashram will not give this list.
('41', 464, 1, 6, 845334) I think I saw the argument advanced by Dhiren about the difficulty of tracing every spinner and I wrote combating that argument and showing a way out of the difficulty.
('41', 464, 1, 7, 845503) The difficulty raised by Dhiren was not raised by him alone.
('41', 464, 1, 8, 845564) It is a difficulty common to almost all and all are gradually getting over the difficulty.
('41', 464, 1, 9, 845655) I quite agree with you that in order to establish a living contact with the spinners, we must have women workers.
('41', 464, 1, 10, 845769) Tell Shanti Devi I would like her to make a start.
('41', 464, 1, 11, 845820) Now about your scheme.
('41', 464, 1, 12, 845843) I like the general idea.
('41', 464, 1, 13, 845868) How far you can give effect to it there, I do not know.
('41', 464, 1, 14, 845924) Because after all you want honest and able teachers who know their work.
('41', 464, 1, 15, 845997) We have not too many as yet.
('41', 464, 1, 16, 846026) But make out your scheme and send it to Jamnalalji unofficially in the first instance and see how it appeals to him.
('41', 464, 1, 17, 846143) Tell me how Bharat is doing there and how spinning is going on among the students.
('41', 464, 1, 18, 846226) By this time you know about Maganlals death.
('41', 464, 2, 19, 846271) Yours sincerely,

('41', 465, 7, 16, 847180) I do not think I replied to the previous letter because in it you led me to expect another to tell me definitely what the passage would be and whether there would be any difficulty about your passports.
('41', 465, 7, 17, 847383) In your recent letter whilst I understand all about the passports, there is no reference to the fare required.
('41', 465, 7, 18, 847494) If you give me a definite idea, I would be able to approach friends and ask them to give me the amount.

('41', 467, 2, 6, 849628) I regard this move ment as one for developing fearlessness and for self purification.
('41', 467, 2, 7, 849714) How can they who call themselves Raniparaj live in fear?
('41', 467, 2, 8, 849771) In the sacrificial effort of self purification, how could they afford to have vices like drinking, gambling and wearing foreign cloth?
('41', 467, 2, 9, 849906) I trust, therefore, that the Raniparaj men and women will give increasing importance to the spinning wheel, use more and more khadi and abstain from drinking and give up other vices.

('41', 467, 5, 12, 850160) 540. THE MEANING OF VOLUNTARY POVERTY 1
('41', 467, 6, 13, 850200) Chhaganlal Joshi is the Secretary to the Managing Committee of the Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati.
('41', 467, 6, 14, 850297) He had a university scholarship for post graduate study in economics and ever since he gave up that scholarship to take part in the non co operation movement he has been in the Ashram.
('41', 467, 6, 15, 850482) About a fortnight ago he had a summons from a first class magistrate to appear as witness in a criminal case.
('41', 467, 6, 16, 850592) The policeman who came to serve the summons behaved most carelessly.
('41', 467, 6, 17, 850661) He came shouting for Chhaganlal Joshi.
('41', 467, 6, 18, 850700) This I heard and directed him to Sjt.
('41', 467, 6, 19, 850738) Chhaganlal Joshi.
('41', 467, 6, 20, 850756) He gave him the summons.
('41', 467, 6, 21, 850781) Chhaganlal asked him to wait until he had read it, but take it if you care he said and went away.
('41', 467, 6, 22, 850879) Chhaganlal read out the summons to me.
('41', 467, 6, 23, 850918) He seemed to be knowing nothing about the case, and he did not know what to do.
('41', 467, 6, 24, 850998) He had no time of his own, nor had he any money for railway fare.
('41', 467, 6, 25, 851064) For all his time and money belonged to the Ashram, as every member is
('41', 467, 7, 26, 851134) 1 The Gujarati original of which this is a translation by Mahadev Desai appeared in Navajivan, 29 4 1928.
('41', 468, 0, 1, 851240) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 469
('41', 468, 1, 2, 851282) supposed to have given his all to the Ashram.
('41', 468, 1, 3, 851328) The money in possession of the Ashram is all public money ear marked by the donors for the purpose for which it exists, and could certainly not be utilized for railway fare to respond to a summons.
('41', 468, 1, 4, 851526) And so Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 5, 851538) Chhaganlal Joshi was in the predicament of the pauper of Orissa, the only difference being that whilst the latter could receive and use for himself whatever others gave him the former could not use a donation except for the purpose of the Ashram.
('41', 468, 1, 6, 851785) Herein lies the beauty as well as the restraint of voluntary poverty.
('41', 468, 1, 7, 851855) What then would an Orissa pauper do if he was served with a sum mons as in this case?
('41', 468, 1, 8, 851941) The policeman had not cared to explain to him the meaning of the summons, nor to pay him the railway fare to enable him to go to the court.
('41', 468, 1, 9, 852081) In the present case the magistrates court was some miles away from Ahmedabad near a station on the Prantij line.
('41', 468, 1, 10, 852194) The Oris sa pauper would be absolutely helpless and would not know what to do.
('41', 468, 1, 11, 852273) So Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 12, 852281) Chhaganlal decided to sit still and suffer the consequences.
('41', 468, 1, 13, 852342) Otherwise his voluntary poverty would have no meaning, nor could he serve the poor if he did not behave like them.
('41', 468, 1, 14, 852457) This inevitable inability to respond to the summons was interpreted by the magistrate as contempt of court and he issued a warrant of arrest against Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 15, 852611) The man serving the warrant said: We will not arrest you, if you promise to attend on the due date. I would willingly promise, said Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 16, 852748) Joshi, provided I got the railway fare and allowance. The man had no authority to make the payment and so he produced Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 17, 852871) Joshi before a first class magistrate in Ahmedabad.
('41', 468, 1, 18, 852923) The latter had no time to go into the ase.
('41', 468, 1, 19, 852966) Joshi explained how he failed to obey the summons, but the magistrate trained in the traditions of the bureaucracy said : I am afraid I can do nothing.
('41', 468, 1, 20, 853118) I am prepared to release you on bail, and you may if you like agitate later on. If he was prepared to give bail, without getting the fare and the allowance, why should he not have obeyed the original summons?
('41', 468, 1, 21, 853327) The sun was blazing overhead when Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 22, 853366) Joshi was ordered to proceed to the police station.
('41', 468, 1, 23, 853418) He refused any longer to walk and the policemen in charge were compelled to hire a carriage.
('41', 468, 1, 24, 853511) Ultimately Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 25, 853527) Joshi was taken to Talod under a full police escort and produced before the magistrate.
('41', 468, 1, 26, 853615) The moment the magistrate saw Sjt.
('41', 468, 1, 27, 853650) Joshi he
('41', 469, 0, 1, 853659) 470 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 469, 1, 2, 853701) realized his mistake, paid him the fare and allowance and released him on parole.
('41', 469, 1, 3, 853783) It is reported that this simple act of courage had a very good effect on the people of Talod who were greatly delighted.
('41', 469, 1, 4, 853904) Those who have accepted voluntary poverty can by acting in the manner of Chhaganlal Joshi easily hasten the end of the injustice and tyranny that seems today to be the lot of the poor.
('41', 469, 1, 5, 854089) The thoughtless discourtesy of the magistrate in the case was remarkable.
('41', 469, 1, 6, 854163) He issued summons without the least inquiry and having done so did nothing to provide the man summoned with the wherewithal to obey the summons.
('41', 469, 1, 7, 854308) I am told that it is not the practice to pay the witnesses railway fare and allowance in advance.
('41', 469, 1, 8, 854406) If that is the case, it means terrible hardship for the poor.
('41', 469, 1, 9, 854468) The issue of warrant in the case betrayed the magistrates criminal negligence.
('41', 469, 1, 10, 854547) He had no evidence of the proper service of the summons.
('41', 469, 1, 11, 854604) He did not care to inquire whether Sjt.
('41', 469, 1, 12, 854644) Joshi had at all received the summons.
('41', 469, 1, 13, 854683) One can only imagine what terrible injustice lies hidden in this Governments department of justice.
('41', 469, 1, 14, 854783) It is difficult to say what would have happened in Talod had Sjt.
('41', 469, 1, 15, 854849) Chhaganlal been the dumb pauper of Orissa.
('41', 469, 1, 16, 854892) What a shower of abuse he might have received and how fiercely the magistrate might have bullied him!
('41', 469, 1, 17, 854994) The man who had been so much sinned against might have been branded as a sinner.
('41', 469, 1, 18, 855075) Though the Government is responsible for this reckless and insolent behaviour towards the poor, one cannot help observing that the Indian officials who behave in this fashion have absolutely no excuse to do so.
('41', 469, 1, 19, 855286) It is possible that this high handedness was there even in pre British days.
('41', 469, 1, 20, 855363) But a wrong does not become right if it can be proved to be pre British.
('41', 469, 1, 21, 855436) And if even Indian officials do not mend their ways, those who have accepted voluntary poverty ought to correct them through satyagraha.

('41', 470, 1, 2, 855637) 541. SOUL OF THE ASHRAM
('41', 470, 2, 3, 855661) When Shri Vallabhbhai received the news of Maganlal Gandhis death, he wired: The soul of the Ashram has departed. There was no exaggeration in this.
('41', 470, 2, 4, 855810) I cannot imagine the existence of Satyagraha Ashram without Maganlal.
('41', 470, 2, 5, 855880) Many of my activities were started because I knew that he was there.
('41', 470, 2, 6, 855949) If ever there was a person with whom I identified myself, it was Maganlal.
('41', 470, 2, 7, 856024) We often have to consider whether certain matters will hurt another person, even if that person be ones own son or wife.
('41', 470, 2, 8, 856145) I never had to entertain such fear with regard to Maganlal.
('41', 470, 2, 9, 856205) I never hesitated to set him the most difficult tasks.
('41', 470, 2, 10, 856260) I very often put him in embarrassing situations and he silently bore with them.
('41', 470, 2, 11, 856340) He regarded no work as too mean.
('41', 470, 2, 12, 856373) If I were fit to be anyones guru, I would have proclaimed him my first disciple.
('41', 470, 2, 13, 856454) In all my life I gave only one person the freedom to regard me as his guru and I had my fill of it.
('41', 470, 2, 14, 856554) The fault was not his, as I could see; only I had imperfections.
('41', 470, 2, 15, 856619) Anyone who becomes a guru should possess the power of conferring on the pupil the capacity to carry out whatever task is assigned to him.
('41', 470, 2, 16, 856757) I had not that power and still do not have it.
('41', 470, 2, 17, 856804) But if Maganlal was not a disciple, he was certainly a servant.
('41', 470, 2, 18, 856868) I am convinced that no master could possibly find a servant better or more loyal than Maganlal.
('41', 470, 2, 19, 856964) This may be a conjecture, but I can assert from my experience that I have not found another servant like him.
('41', 470, 2, 20, 857074) It has been my good fortune always to have found co workers, or servants if you like, who were faithful, virtuous, intelligent and industrious.
('41', 470, 2, 21, 857218) Still, Maganlal was the best of all these co workers and servants.
('41', 470, 2, 22, 857285) The three streams of knowledge, devotion and action continuously flowed within Maganlal and, by offering his knowledge and his devotion in the yajna of action, he demonstrated before everyone their true form.
('41', 470, 2, 23, 857494) And because in this way each action of his was full of awareness, knowledge and faith, his life attained the very summit of sannyasa.
('41', 470, 2, 24, 857628) Maganlal had renounced his all.
('41', 470, 2, 25, 857660) I never saw an iota of self interest in any of his actions.
('41', 470, 2, 26, 857720) He showednot once, not for a short time but time after time for twenty four years incessantly that true sannyasa lay in selfless action or action without desire for reward.
('41', 470, 2, 27, 857893) Maganlals father entrusted all his four sons to me one after
('41', 471, 0, 1, 857954) 472 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 471, 1, 2, 857996) another for serving the country.
('41', 471, 1, 3, 858029) Maganlal was entrusted to me in 1903. He accompanied me to South Africa to earn a living.
('41', 471, 1, 4, 858119) In 1904, I invited him along with other friends to embrace poverty in order to serve the country.
('41', 471, 1, 5, 858217) He heard me calmly and embraced poverty.
('41', 471, 1, 6, 858258) From that time on until his death, his life was an un interrupted flow.With each day I realize more and more that my mahatmaship, which is a mere adornment, depends on others.
('41', 471, 1, 7, 858434) I have shone with the glory borrowed from my innumerable co workers.
('41', 471, 1, 8, 858503) However, no one has done more to add to this glory than Maganlal.
('41', 471, 1, 9, 858569) He co operated with me fully and with intelligence in all my activitiesphysical or spiritual.
('41', 471, 1, 10, 858663) I see no better instance than Maganlal of one who made a tremendous effort to act as he believed.
('41', 471, 1, 11, 858761) Maganlal was awake all the twenty four hours esta blishing unity of thought and action.
('41', 471, 1, 12, 858849) He used up all his energy in this.
('41', 471, 1, 13, 858884) If I have not exaggerated, consciously or unconsciously, in this sketch, one can say that a country in which dharma can be so embodied must triumph and so must its dharma.
('41', 471, 1, 14, 859056) Hence I wish that every servant of the country should study Maganlals life and if it commends itself to him imitate it with deter mination.
('41', 471, 1, 15, 859196) What was possible for Maganlal is possible for every man who makes the effort.
('41', 471, 1, 16, 859275) Maganlal could become a true leader because he was a true soldier and I find those who could put up with his fire weeping around me now.
('41', 471, 1, 17, 859412) This country, as also the world, is in need of true soldiers.
('41', 471, 1, 18, 859474) Service of the country, service of the world, self realization, vision of Godthese are not separate things but different aspects of the same thing.
('41', 471, 1, 19, 859622) Maganlal realized the truth of this in his own life and made others do so.
('41', 471, 1, 20, 859697) Those who are curious can study his life and find this out.

('41', 472, 3, 4, 859901) KUNVERJI,
('41', 472, 4, 5, 859911) I have your letter.
('41', 472, 4, 6, 859931) I have never felt that you have taken up khadi work for the sake of money, and my question arose only from yours.
('41', 472, 4, 7, 860045) Will you always be able to live contented doing khadi work?
('41', 472, 4, 8, 860105) You certainly know there is no financial gain in this.
('41', 472, 4, 9, 860160) It provides plain bread.
('41', 472, 4, 10, 860185) I assume from your letter that you will not be able to live in the Ashram if a rule is adopted that only brahmacharis can do so.
('41', 472, 4, 11, 860314) Even in that case I believe there will be no problem in employing you in khadi work.

('41', 472, 9, 18, 860626) You offer to come to the Ashram, and yet, at the end of your letter, you are obliged to say, I am afraid for a long time, I wont be physically fit. No, your sadhana is to make yourself physically fit and, therefore, it is better for you to be where you are, and convalesce.
('41', 472, 9, 19, 860900) I would even suggest your going to Giridih and be at the side of Nikhil.

('41', 473, 5, 13, 861644) I have no confidence in my abiliy to assist.
('41', 473, 5, 14, 861689) My solution of the problem is so different from what is generally expected.
('41', 473, 5, 15, 861765) I am more than ever convinced that the communal problem should be solved outside of legislation and if, in order to reach that state, there has to be civil war, so be it.

('41', 473, 10, 22, 862132) DEAR LALAJI, I have your characteristic letter.
('41', 473, 10, 23, 862180) I am glad you had an ocular demonstration of what form untouchability takes in the south.
('41', 473, 10, 24, 862270) I wish you could have been there longer to see the unapproachables and the
('41', 474, 0, 1, 862345) VOL. 41: 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 475
('41', 474, 1, 2, 862387) invisibles face to face, and to talk to them.
('41', 474, 1, 3, 862433) And in this connection let me tell you what an important part khadi is playing in reaching even the unapproachables and invisibles, because it is khadi that makes it possible to establish contacts which before were impossible or unthinkable.
('41', 474, 1, 4, 862675) However this is by the way and written not to influence you in favour of khadi through a side issue.
('41', 474, 1, 5, 862776) I am therefore glad that yu are making a serious study of the subject.
('41', 474, 1, 6, 862847) And I am glad, too, that you are determined not to come to any hasty decision.
('41', 474, 1, 7, 862926) Whatever conclusions you may ultimately form, I would like you to feel about them as you feel about untouchability.
('41', 474, 1, 8, 863042) No argument against untouchability from the so called sanatana quarters or any quarter could possibly dislodge you from the position you hold.
('41', 474, 1, 9, 863185) I would like you therefore to make a thorough study of the problem before coming to any conclusion whatsoever.
('41', 474, 1, 10, 863296) I want you for khadi.
('41', 474, 1, 11, 863318) I know what a gain it would be.
('41', 474, 1, 12, 863350) But I do not want you as a patron on whose certificate I may trade.
('41', 474, 1, 13, 863418) I want you as a fellow worker who will not be dislodged from his position and who would be working for the cause of khadi to the best of his ability.
('41', 474, 1, 14, 863568) For the present, therefore, I would like you, after you study, to discuss the subject with me if you have any doubts before you commit yourself.
('41', 474, 1, 15, 863713) By all means carry on correspondence with me or those who may be hostile to khadi, but I would like you to promise that you will not commit yourself before discussing with me the criticism that may apear to you to be convincing and unanswerable.
('41', 474, 1, 16, 863959) Let me assure you that there are in the khadi movement people who have made a thorough study of the subject and who will leave khadi without a moments hesitation if they found that the premises on which they proceeded were insupportable.
('41', 474, 1, 17, 864197) Yes, indeed, Maganlals death is the heaviest blow I could have received.
('41', 474, 1, 18, 864270) But in the battle for freedom, we have little time to shed tears over the departure of the dearest.

('41', 478, 2, 3, 867010) MY DEAR RAMANATHAN, I have your letter about .
('41', 478, 2, 4, 867057) 1 I see your law is at fault.
('41', 478, 2, 5, 867087) If you have no writing from .
('41', 478, 2, 6, 867117) , I am sure that we cannot pay ourselves for any loss incurred owing to the negligence or fraud of workers, even though the latter may have furnished cash security.
('41', 478, 2, 7, 867282) Do you not see that it is a dangerous doctrine?
('41', 478, 2, 8, 867330) If such were the law, employees would be at the mercy of employers who would be judges and executioners combined.
('41', 478, 2, 9, 867444) What may appear to an employer to be negligence or fraud, may not honestly appear to be that to an employee and may not be such even in law.
('41', 478, 2, 10, 867585) A well ordered society, therefore, requires unequivocal written documents, if securities furnished by employees are to be appropriated for patent negligence or fraud.
('41', 478, 2, 11, 867752) Whatever, therefore, you do about .
('41', 478, 2, 12, 867788) I suggest that you should take a written document from all the employees from whom you have taken securities.
('41', 478, 2, 13, 867898) About .
('41', 478, 2, 14, 867906) , I suggest that you state the facts that you may have in your possession in proof of his dishonesty, tell him that you hold the security as guarantee for the damage sustained in accordance with the custom of the association and in accordance with the verbal agreement between him and yourself and offer to take him to a court of law if he wishes or to submit it to arbitrators, one to be appointed by him and one by us.
('41', 478, 2, 15, 868327) I promised to write to .
('41', 478, 2, 16, 868352) after I had heard from you.
('41', 478, 2, 17, 868380) I will await your answer before writing to him.

('41', 479, 2, 4, 868757) DEAR DR.
('41', 479, 2, 5, 868766) BIDHAN, Your letter flatters me, 1 but I must not succumb to my pride.
('41', 479, 2, 6, 868837) Apart from the fact that as a non co operator I may have nothing to do with the University that is in any way connected with Government, I do not consider myself to be a fit and proper person to deliver Kamala lectures 2. I do not possess the literary attainment which Sir Ashutosh undoubtedly contemplated for the lecturers.
('41', 479, 3, 7, 869163) You are asking me to shoulder a responsibility which my shoulders cannot bear.
('41', 479, 3, 8, 869242) I am keeping fairly fit.
('41', 479, 3, 9, 869267) I am biding my time and you will find me leading the country in the field of politics when the country is ready.
('41', 479, 3, 10, 869380) I have no false modesty about me.
('41', 479, 3, 11, 869414) I am undoubtedly a politician in my own way, and I have a scheme for the countrys freedom.
('41', 479, 3, 12, 869505) But my time is not yet and may never come to me in this life.
('41', 479, 3, 13, 869567) If it does not, I shall not shed a single tear.
('41', 479, 3, 14, 869615) We are all in the hands of God.
('41', 479, 3, 15, 869647) I therefore await His guidance.

('41', 480, 3, 4, 870019) PRABHUDAS, I have your letter.
('41', 480, 3, 5, 870050) I do not have the courage to let you come here.
('41', 480, 3, 6, 870098) Nor is it necessary for you to come.
('41', 480, 3, 7, 870135) I have suggested to Devdas that he should go and be with you.
('41', 480, 3, 8, 870197) If you send me a specimen of your model of the spinning wheel, I will ask someone here to work it.
('41', 480, 3, 9, 870296) I will obtain Keshus report.
('41', 480, 3, 10, 870325) Lakshmidas, who also is here now, may also see it.
('41', 480, 3, 11, 870376) I may suffer your coming here when the weather is colder.
('41', 480, 3, 12, 870434) Do come in the winter.
('41', 480, 3, 13, 870457) Besides, Chhaganlal is there, and even for his sake, it is essential that you remain there.
('41', 480, 3, 14, 870549) I certainly cannot let Chhaganlal come here.
('41', 480, 3, 15, 870594) When his health is completely restored, he will of course come.
('41', 480, 3, 16, 870658) My proposed visit to Europe has been cancelled, and so that reason also for your coming here does not exist.
('41', 480, 3, 17, 870767) Moreover, as it is, you have been doing some work there and so, you need have no scruples in staying on there.
('41', 480, 3, 18, 870878) What can I write about Maganlal?
('41', 480, 3, 19, 870911) Khushalbhai and Devbhabhi have arrived.
('41', 480, 3, 20, 870951) They are bearing the loss with great fortitude.
('41', 480, 3, 21, 870999) Some changes have been taking place in the Ashram these days.
('41', 480, 3, 22, 871061) You must be getting an account of them.
('41', 480, 4, 23, 871101) Blessings from BAPU [PS.] The figures of the account marked by me in the accompanying pamphlet do not seem to be correct.
('41', 480, 4, 24, 871223) Go through them and then let me know.
('41', 480, 4, 25, 871261) Return the pamphlet to me.
('41', 480, 4, 26, 871288) I wish to write something about it.

('41', 480, 6, 29, 871524) The Tuesday following this announcement fell on 1st May.
('41', 480, 6, 30, 871581) The reference to Khushalbhai and Devbhabhis arrival and their bearing the loss of Maganlals death with fortitude also indicates that the letter may have been written on 1st May, 1928. Maganlal had died in Patna on April 23, 1928.

('41', 481, 1, 2, 871853) 553. SPEECH AT OPENING OF CRECHE, AHMEDABAD 1
('41', 481, 2, 3, 871899) May 1, 1928 Perhaps it is quite appropriate that this creche is being opened by one who calls himself a labourer, though let me confess to you that it was not without some hesitation that I accepted the invitation when it was brought to me by Sheth Kasturbhai, not because I did not like the object, but because I was so preoccupied, and nothing would have pleased me better than that you should have got this function performed by someone more deserving than myself preferably a mill owner.
('41', 481, 2, 4, 872391) But my regard for Sheth Kasturbhai prevailed and I had to yield.
('41', 481, 2, 5, 872456) When I established my Ashram in Ahmedabad the consideration which weighed with me was not merely that it was the capital of Gujarat, nor that it was a busy commercial centre but that it was a great centre of textile industry and I felt that I could reasonably count on the help of the mill agents and be able to render some service to the city.
('41', 481, 2, 6, 872801) Today I am glad to be able to say that these expectations of mine have not been altogether unfulfilled.
('41', 481, 2, 7, 872905) Though I have a recollection of some bitter experiences I have also a number of sweet recollections of my relations with the mill owners.
('41', 481, 2, 8, 873043) I have not yet given up hope of Ahmedabad.
('41', 481, 2, 9, 873086) I still expect great things of it.
('41', 481, 2, 10, 873121) It has much to accomplish yet, and among other things, speaking as a labourer myself, and as one who has tried to enter into the innermost feelings of the working class I say that Ahmedabad has much to do yet towards the amelioration of the condition of the labouring class.
('41', 481, 2, 11, 873396) My connection with the labour of this place is not of yesterday.
('41', 481, 2, 12, 873461) It is as old as my first coming to this city, and so I make bold to tell you that you have not yet done your part towards your labouring population.
('41', 481, 2, 13, 873610) In some cases the labourers have not been provided with even the primary amenities of life.
('41', 481, 2, 14, 873702) There are exceptions, however.
('41', 481, 2, 15, 873733) Some mill owners have made some effort in the direction, and the present one is an instance in point.
('41', 481, 2, 16, 873835) The sentiments about the welfare of the mill hands that Sheth Kas turbhai has just now uttered before you reflect credit on him and the city of Ahmedabad.
('41', 481, 2, 17, 873990) Sheth Kasturbhai was delighted with Port Sunlight, and rightly.
('41', 481, 2, 18, 874054) But Port Sunlight cannot be our ideal.
('41', 481, 2, 19, 874093) Messrs Lever Bros.
('41', 481, 2, 20, 874112) represent to my mind the minimum standard that an
('41', 481, 3, 21, 874162) 1 Kasturbhai Lalbhai, Agent, Raipur Manufacturing Company, had requested Gandhiji to perform the opening ceremony.

('41', 482, 1, 2, 874319) employer must do for his employees.
('41', 482, 1, 3, 874355) To do less would be a discredit.
('41', 482, 1, 4, 874388) But we cannot afford to rest content with that.
('41', 482, 1, 5, 874436) We must think in terms of our own civilization, and if the picture presented to us in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana of the social conditions prevailing in the ancient times be correct, our ideal would seem to go much farther than Port Sunlight.
('41', 482, 1, 6, 874684) I have read a lot of li terature about Port Sunlight, and I am an ardent admirer of their welfare work, but I maintain that ours is a higher ideal.
('41', 482, 1, 7, 874832) In the West there is still a watertight division between the employer and the employees.
('41', 482, 1, 8, 874921) I know it is impertinent to talk of our ideal, while the curse of untouchability still stalks through the land.
('41', 482, 1, 9, 875033) But I should be untrue to myself and be failing in my duty to you if I did not place before you what I regard as the highest ideal.
('41', 482, 1, 10, 875165) The relation between mill agents and mill hands ought to be one of father and childeren or as between blood brothers.
('41', 482, 1, 11, 875283) I have often heard the mill owners of Ahmedabad refer to themselves as masters and their employees as their servants.
('41', 482, 1, 12, 875401) Such loose talk should be out of fashion in a place like Ahmedabad which prides itself on its love of religion and love of ahimsa.
('41', 482, 1, 13, 875532) For that attitude is a negation of ahimsa, inasmuch as our ideal demands that all our power, all our wealth and all our brains should be devoted solely to the welfare of those who through their own ignorance and our false notions of things are styled labourers or servants.
('41', 482, 1, 14, 875806) What I expect of you therefore is that you should hold all your riches as a trust to be used solely in the interests of those who sweat for you, and to whose industry and labour you owe all your position and prosperity.
('41', 482, 1, 15, 876026) I want you to make your labourers co partners of your wealth.
('41', 482, 1, 16, 876088) I do not mean to suggest that unless you legally bind yourselves to do all that, there should be a labour insurrection.
('41', 482, 1, 17, 876208) The only sanction that I can think of in this connection is of mutual love and regard as between father and son, not of law.
('41', 482, 1, 18, 876333) If only you make it a rule to respect these mutual obligations of love, there would be an end to all labour disputes, the workers would no longer feel the need for organizing themselves into unions.
('41', 482, 1, 19, 876532) Under the ideal contemplated by me, there would be nothing left for our Anasuyabehns and Shankerlals to do; their occupation would be gone.
('41', 482, 1, 20, 876672) But that cannot happen until there is a single mill hand who does not regard the mill in which he works as his own, who complains of sweating and overwork, and who therefore nurses in his breast nothing but ill will towards his employers.And where is the difficulty?
('41', 482, 1, 21, 876939) You have told us and it is recognized everywhere that the mill 
('41', 483, 0, 1, 877003) 484 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 483, 1, 2, 877045) owners stand only to gain by doing all this.
('41', 483, 1, 3, 877090) Messrs Lever Bros.
('41', 483, 1, 4, 877109) lost nothing by doing all that they did.
('41', 483, 1, 5, 877150) They felt so encouraged that they even tried to create another Port Sunlight in Natal.
('41', 483, 1, 6, 877237) As our experience gradually broadens we are beginning to see more and more clearly that the more we give to our workers the more we stand to gain.
('41', 483, 1, 7, 877384) From the moment your men come to realize that the mills are theirs, no less than yours, they will begin to feel towards you as blood brothers, there would be no question of their acting against the common interest and the need for having a heavy supervisory establishment over them.
('41', 483, 1, 8, 877667) You have given me credit for keeping the city of Ahmedabad free from a labour upheaval such as Bombay is at present passing through.
('41', 483, 1, 9, 877800) Well, I cannot quite disclaim that credit, for does anyone among you for a moment doubt that things would have been otherwise here, but for the work that Shrimati Anasuyabehn and Sjt.
('41', 483, 1, 10, 877984) Shankerlal have been doing?
('41', 483, 1, 11, 878012) It is true perhaps that you the mill owners of Ahmedabad are more tactful than the Bombay mill owners.
('41', 483, 1, 12, 878115) In case of an upheaval you do not employ hooligans to crush your men as some employers in the West do, and I fancy that you have deliberately abjured that weapon of suppressing the aspirations of labour.
('41', 483, 1, 13, 878319) My critics tell me that this is all moonshine, and that you would not hesitate to resort to such means, if you could.
('41', 483, 1, 14, 878437) But I believe that they are mistaken and I want you to prove by your conduct that they are mistaken.
('41', 483, 1, 15, 878538) I hope you will help to bring near the time when the sort of work that Sjt.
('41', 483, 1, 16, 878614) Banker Shrimati Anasuyabehn are doing would be rendered needless, and pending that consummation give them all the help, all the encouragement that they need in their work.
('41', 483, 1, 17, 878786) Now perhaps you understand why I have dared to appropriate a little credit for the peace that prevails here today.
('41', 483, 1, 18, 878901) It belongs not to me but to Shrimati Anasuyabehn and Sjt.
('41', 483, 1, 19, 878959) Shankerlal Banker.
('41', 483, 1, 20, 878978) They live, move and have their being among the labourers, which I am unable to do.
('41', 483, 1, 21, 879061) If you aid the efforts of these friends you will find there will not be much need left for erecting creches like this one or for providing medical relief.
('41', 483, 1, 22, 879216) I do not wish to detract from the merit of these efforts of yours, but I ask you whether any well to do man would care to send his children to a creche like this.
('41', 483, 1, 23, 879379) Our endeavour should be to bring about a state of things under which there would be no occasion for a mill hands baby to be torn from its mother, and when a factory hands child would receive the same opportunities for education that our own children have.

('41', 484, 4, 5, 879781) This Congress resolves : (1) That in any future scheme of constitution, so far as representation in various legislatures is concerned, joint electorates in all the provinces and in the Central Legislature be constituted; (2) That, with a view to giving full assurances to the two great communities that their legitimate interests will be safeguarded in the Legislatures such representation of the communities should be secured for the present, and if desired, by the reservation of seats in joint electorates on the basis of population in every province and in the Cental Legislature : Provided that reciprocal concessions in favour of minorities may be made by mutual agreement so as to give them representation in excess of the proportion of the number of seats to which they would be entitled on the population basis in any province or provinces and the proportions so agreed upon for the provinces shall be maintained in the representation of the two communities in the Central Legislature from the provinces.
('41', 484, 4, 6, 880795) In the decision of the reservation of seats for the Punjab, the question of the representation of Sikhs as an important minority will be given full consideration; 3(a) That the proposal made by the Muslim leaders that the reforms should be introduced in the N.W.F. Province and British Baluchistan on the same footing as in other provinces is, in the opinion of the Congress, a fair and reasonable one, and should be given effect to, care being taken that simultaneously with other measures of administrative reform an adequate system of judicial administration shall be introduced in the said provinces; (b)(i) That with regard to the proposal that Sind should be constituted into a separate province, this Congress is of opinion that the time has come for the redistribution of provinces on a linguistic basisa principle that has been adopted in the constitution of the Congress; (ii) This Congress is also of opinion that such readjustment of provinces be immediately taken in hand and that any province which demands such reconstitution on linguistic basis be dealt with accordingly; (iii) This Congress is further of opinion that a beginning may be made by reconstituting Andhra, Utakl, Sind and Karnatak into separate provinces; 4. That, in the future constitution, liberty of conscience shall be guaranteed

('41', 485, 1, 2, 882297) and no legislature, Central or Provincial, shall have power to make any laws interfering with liberty of conscience; Liberty of conscience means liberty of belief and worship, freedom of religious observances and association and freedom to carry on religious education and propaganda with due regard to the feelings of others and without interfering with similar rights of others; 5. That no bill, resolution, motion or amendment regarding intercommunal matters shall be moved, discussed or passed in any legislature, Central or Provincial, if a three fourths majority of the members of either community affected thereby in that legislature oppose the introduction, discussion or passing of such bill, resolution, motion or amendment.
('41', 485, 1, 3, 883032) Intercommunal matters means matters agreed upon by such a joint Standing Committee of both communitiesof the Hindu and Muslim members of the legislature concerned appointed at the commencement of every session of the legislature.

('41', 485, 2, 5, 883295) This Congress resolves that :
('41', 485, 3, 6, 883325) 1. Without prejudice to the rights Hindus and Mussalmans claim, the one to play music and conduct processions wherever they please and the other to slaughter cows for sacrifice or food wherever they please, the Mussalmans appeal to the Mussalmans to spare Hindu feelings as much as possible in the matter of the cow and the Hindus appeal to the Hindus to spare Mussalman feelings, as much as possible in the matter of music before mosques.
('41', 485, 3, 7, 883765) And therefore, this Congress calls upon both the Hindus and Mussal mans not to have recourse to violence or to law to prevent the slaughter of a cow or the playing of music before a mosque.
('41', 485, 4, 8, 883955) 2. This Congress further resolves that every individual or group is at liberty to convert or reconvert another by argument or persuasion but no individual or group shall attempt to do so, or prevent its being done by force, fraud or other unfair means such as the offering of material inducement.
('41', 485, 4, 9, 884252) Persons under eighteen years of age should not be converted unless it be along with their parents or guardians.
('41', 485, 4, 10, 884364) If any person under eighteen years of age is found stranded without his parents or guardian by persons of another faith he should be promptly handed over to persons of his own faith.
('41', 485, 4, 11, 884547) There must be no secrecy as to the person, place, time and manner about any conversion or reconversion, nor should there be any demonstration of jubilation in support of any conversion or reconversion.
('41', 485, 5, 12, 884749) Whenever any complaint is made in respect of any conversion or reconversion, that it was effected in secrecy or by force, fraud or other unfair means,

('41', 486, 7, 8, 885551) ALLAHABAD,
('41', 486, 8, 9, 885562) January 11, 1928
('41', 486, 9, 10, 885579) MY DEAR BAPUJI,
('41', 486, 10, 11, 885595) The Working Committee is now meeting in Banaras and so I cannot go to Bombay or Sabarmati for some time.
('41', 486, 11, 12, 885700) I am loath to inflict another letter on you so soon after my last but I am very much troubled by your criticisms of the Congress resolutions and I feel I must write to you again.
('41', 486, 11, 13, 885879) You are always very careful with you words and your language is studiously restrained.
('41', 486, 11, 14, 885966) It amazes me all the more to find you using language which appears to me wholly unjustified.
('41', 486, 11, 15, 886059) You have condemned in general language the proceedings of the Subjects Committee and specially selected some resolutions for greater criticism and condemnation.
('41', 486, 11, 16, 886220) May I point out that it is always unsafe to judge on hearsay evidence?
('41', 486, 11, 17, 886291) You were not present yourself and it is quite conceivable that the opinions you may have formed after a personal visit to the Subjects Committee may have been different.
('41', 486, 11, 18, 886461) Yet you have chosen to condemn and judge unfavourably the whole Committee, or at any rate a great majority of it, simply basing your judgment on the impressions of a few persons.
('41', 486, 11, 19, 886640) Do you think this is quite fair to the Committee or the Congress?
('41', 486, 11, 20, 886706) You have referred to discipline and to the Working Committee as the National Cabinet.
('41', 486, 11, 21, 886792) May I remind you that you are a member of the Working Committee and it is an extraordinary thing for a memebr on the morrow of the Congress to criticize, and run down the Congress and its principal resolutions.
('41', 486, 11, 22, 887003) There has been a general chorus of congratulation on the success of the Madras Congress.
('41', 486, 11, 23, 887092) This may be wrong or without sufficient basis but undoubtedly there was this general impression in the country and atmosphere counts for a great deal in all public work.
('41', 486, 11, 24, 887262) And now most people who thought so feel a bit dazed at your criticisms and wonder if their previous enthusiasm was not overdone or mistaken.
('41', 486, 12, 25, 887403) 1 Vide Letter to Jawaharlal Nehru, 17 1 1928.
('41', 487, 0, 1, 887449) 488 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 487, 1, 2, 887491) You have described the Independence Resolution as hastily conceived and thoughtlessly passed.
('41', 487, 1, 3, 887585) I have already pointed out to you how the country has discussed and considered this question for years past, and how I have personally thought over it, discussed it, spoken about it in meetings, written about it and generally been full of it for the last five years or more.
('41', 487, 1, 4, 887860) It seems to me that under the circumstances no stretch of language can justify the use of the words hastily conceived.
('41', 487, 1, 5, 887979) As for thoughtlessly passed I wonder if you know that the resolution was discussed in the Subjects Committee for about three hours and more than a dozen speeches for and against were made.
('41', 487, 1, 6, 888168) Ultimately as you know it was passed almost unanimously both in the Committee and the open Congress.
('41', 487, 1, 7, 888269) Were all the people in the Committee and the Congress who voted for it thoughtless?
('41', 487, 1, 8, 888353) Is this not rather a large assumption?
('41', 487, 1, 9, 888392) And why should it not be said with greater truth that the small minority opposed to the resolution were mistaken?
('41', 487, 1, 10, 888506) You mention that last year the resolution was rejected by the Committee.
('41', 487, 1, 11, 888579) I do not know what inferene you draw from this but to me it seems obvious that this can only mean that the Committee and the Congress have been eager to pass it in the past as in the present but refrained from doing so out of regard for you.
('41', 487, 1, 12, 888821) I hope will agree with me that it is not healthy politics for any organization to subordinate its own definite opinion on a public issue out of personal regard only.
('41', 487, 1, 13, 888987) I am not referring here to the merits of the resolution.
('41', 487, 1, 14, 889044) But I shall only say this that after prolonged and careful thought a demand for independence and all that this implies has come to mean a very great deal for me and I attach more importance to it than to almost anything else.
('41', 487, 1, 15, 889270) I have thought over every word you said the other day in Madras on this question and it has merely confirmed me in my opinion.
('41', 487, 1, 16, 889397) But I doubt if anyone outside a small circle understands your position in regard to this.
('41', 487, 1, 17, 889487) I am sure that none of the othersliberals, etc., who want dominion status think in the same way with you.
('41', 487, 1, 18, 889593) Yesterday Sir Ali Imam addressed a meeting here on the Simon boycott.
('41', 487, 1, 19, 889663) I also spoke for a few minutes and like King Charles head independence cropped up and I laid stress on it.
('41', 487, 1, 20, 889770) After the meeting Ali Imam told me that I did well in laying stress on this; he and his friends would probably come round to this position sooner or later but for the time being they had to be a little restrained as they wanted to carry many people with them.
('41', 487, 1, 21, 890030) I am sure most liberals welcome the Independence Resolution, whatever they may say about it, as they feel that it strengthens their position.
('41', 487, 1, 22, 890172) But whether they like it or not, it passes my comprehension how a national organization can have as its ideal and goal dominion status.
('41', 487, 1, 23, 890308) The very idea suffocates and strangles me.
('41', 487, 2, 24, 890351) I took no special interest in the resolution on the boycott of British goods chiefly because I felt that it would meet with your strong disapproval and the boycott could not succeed unless a more or less unanimous effort was made.
('41', 487, 2, 25, 890582) But I have no doubt that it can be made into a partial success if there was some unanimity in our own ranks.
('41', 487, 2, 26, 890691) You must have read about the wonderful effectiveness of the boycott in China.
('41', 488, 0, 1, 890769) VOL. 41 : 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 489
('41', 488, 1, 2, 890812) There was nothing special in China which we have not got and there is no fundamental reason why we cannot succeed where they succeeded.
('41', 488, 1, 3, 890948) But granting that it is not likely to succeed is it such a laughing matter after all?
('41', 488, 1, 4, 891034) Has our boycott of foreign cloth by khaddar succeeded so remarkably?
('41', 488, 1, 5, 891103) Has our spinning franchise succeeded?
('41', 488, 1, 6, 891141) They have not but you do not hesitate to them on the country and the Congress because you felt, and rightly, that they would be good for the nation even if they did not wholly succeed.
('41', 488, 2, 7, 891326) I remember how Kelkar, Aney and Co., even as members of the Working Committee, used to make fun of the Congress resolutions on khadi, and it is very painful for me to think that you are also ridiculing important Congress resolutions.
('41', 488, 2, 8, 891560) The Kelkars and Aneys do not count and I do not care what they say or do.
('41', 488, 2, 9, 891634) But I do care very much for what you say and do.
('41', 488, 3, 10, 891683) Having singled out two resolutions for your special condemnation you casually refer to the others as several irresponsible resolutions.
('41', 488, 3, 11, 891819) Excepting the Unity Resolution every other resolution of the Congress may come under this heading.
('41', 488, 3, 12, 891918) And so the labours of the 200 and odd persons in the Subjects Committee and the larger number in the Congress are summarily and rather contemptuously disposed of.
('41', 488, 3, 13, 892081) It is very hard luck on the unhappy persons who, though wanting perhaps in foresight and intelligence, did not spare themselves and tried to do their best.
('41', 488, 3, 14, 892237) We have all sunk to the level of the schoolboys debating society and you chastize us like an angry school master, but a school master who will not guide us or give us lessons but will only point out from time to time the error of our ways.
('41', 488, 3, 15, 892477) Personally I very much wish that we were more like real schoolboys, with the life and energy and daring of schoolboys, and a little less like the right honourable and honourable gentlemen who are for ever weighing the pros and cons and counting the cost.
('41', 488, 4, 16, 892732) You know how intensely I have admired you and believed in you as a leader who can lead this country to victory and freedom.
('41', 488, 4, 17, 892856) I have done so in spite of the fact that I hardly agreed with anything that some of your previous publicationsIndian Home Rule, etc.,contained.
('41', 488, 4, 18, 893000) I felt and feel that you were and are infinitley greater than your little books.
('41', 488, 4, 19, 893081) Above everything I admire action and daring and courage and I found them all in you in a superlative degree.
('41', 488, 4, 20, 893190) And I felt instinctively that, however much I may disagree with you, your great personality and your possession of these qualities would carry us to our goal.
('41', 488, 4, 21, 893349) During the N. C. O. period you were supreme; you were in your element and automatically you took the right step.
('41', 488, 4, 22, 893462) But since you came out of prison something seems to have gone wrong and you have been very obviously ill at ease.
('41', 488, 4, 23, 893576) You will remember how within a few months or even weeks you repeatedly changed your attitudethe Juhu statements, the A.I.C.C. meeting at Ahmedabad and after, etc.,and most of us were left in utter bewilderment.
('41', 488, 4, 24, 893787) That bewilderment has continued since then.
('41', 488, 4, 25, 893831) I have asked you many times what you expected to do in the future and your answers have been far from satisfying.
('41', 488, 4, 26, 893945) All you
('41', 489, 0, 1, 893953) 490 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 489, 1, 2, 893995) have said has been that within a year or eighteen months you expected the khadi movement to spread repidly and in a geometric ratio and then some direct action in the political field might be indulged in.
('41', 489, 1, 3, 894200) Several years and eighteen months have passed since then and the miracle has not happened.
('41', 489, 1, 4, 894291) It was difficult to believe that it would happen but faith in your amiazing capacity to bring off the improbable kept us in an expectant mood.
('41', 489, 1, 5, 894434) But such faith for an irreligious person like me is a poor reed to reply on and I am beginning to think if we are to wait for freedom till khadi becomes universal in India we shall have to wait till the Greek Kalends.
('41', 489, 1, 6, 894652) Khadi will grow slowly, and if war comes it will grow very fast, but I do not see how freedom is coming in its train.
('41', 489, 1, 7, 894770) As I mentioned before you our khadi work is almost wholly divorced from politics and our khadi workers ae developing a mentality which does not concern itself with anything outside their limited sphere of work.
('41', 489, 1, 8, 894981) This may be good for the work they do, but little can be expected from them in the political field.
('41', 489, 2, 9, 895081) What then can be done?
('41', 489, 2, 10, 895104) You say nothing,you only criticize and no helpful lead comes from you.
('41', 489, 2, 11, 895175) You tell us that if the country will not even take to khadi how can we expect it to do anything more difficult or daring.
('41', 489, 2, 12, 895297) I do not think the reasoning is correct.
('41', 489, 2, 13, 895338) If the country does not go ahead politically by one method, surely it is up to our leaders to think of other or additional methods.
('41', 489, 3, 14, 895470) Reading many of your articles in Young Indiayour autobiography, etc., I have often felt how very different my ideals were from yours.
('41', 489, 3, 15, 895604) And I have felt that you were very hasty in your judgments, or rather having arrived at certain conclusions you were over eager to justify them by any scrap of evidence you might get.
('41', 489, 3, 16, 895788) I remember how in an article on the Two Ways or some such titleyou gave some newspaper cuttings from America about crimes and immorality and contrasted American civilization with Indian.
('41', 489, 3, 17, 895975) I felt it was something like Katharine Mayo drawing conclusions from some unsavoury hospital statistics.
('41', 489, 3, 18, 896080) Your long series of articles based on the French bookTowards Moral Bankruptcyalso made me feel the same way.
('41', 489, 3, 19, 896189) You misjudge greatly, I think, the civilization of the West and attach too great an importance to its many failings.
('41', 489, 3, 20, 896306) You have stated somewhere that India has nothing to learn from the West and that she had reached a pinnacle of wisdom in the past.
('41', 489, 3, 21, 896437) I certainly disagree with this viewpoint and I neither think that the so called Ramaraj was very good in the past, nor do I want it back.
('41', 489, 3, 22, 896575) I think that western or rather industrial civilization is bound to conquer India maybe with many changes and adaptations, but none the less, in the main, based on industrialism.
('41', 489, 3, 23, 896753) You have criticized strongly the many obvious defects of industrialism and hardly paid any attention to its merits.
('41', 489, 3, 24, 896869) Everybody knows these defects and the utopias and social theories are meant to remove them.
('41', 489, 3, 25, 896961) It is the opinion of most thinkers in the West that these defects are not due to industrialism as such but to the capitalist system which is based on exploitation of others.
('41', 489, 3, 26, 897135) I believe you have stated that in your
('41', 490, 0, 1, 897174) VOL. 41 : 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 491
('41', 490, 1, 2, 897217) opinion there is no necessary conflict between capital and labour.
('41', 490, 1, 3, 897284) I think that under the capitalist system this conflict is unavoidable.
('41', 490, 2, 4, 897355) You have advocated very eloquently and forcefully the claims of the Daridranarayanathe poor in India.
('41', 490, 2, 5, 897457) I do believe that the remedy you have suggested is very helpful to them and if adopted by them in large number will relieve to some extent their misery.
('41', 490, 2, 6, 897610) But I doubt very much if the fundamental cause of poverty are touched by it.
('41', 490, 2, 7, 897687) You do not say a word against the semi feudal zamindari system which prevails in a great part of India or against the capitalist exploitation of both the workers and the consumers.
('41', 490, 3, 8, 897868) But I must stop.
('41', 490, 3, 9, 897885) I have already exceeded all reasonable limits and I hope you will forgive me.
('41', 490, 3, 10, 897963) My only excuse is my mental agitation.
('41', 490, 3, 11, 898002) I did not want to become the secretary of the A.I.C.C. as I wanted perfect freedom to say and do what I considered necessary.
('41', 490, 3, 12, 898128) But Ansari pressed me on the ground that many of my resolutions and specially the Independence Resolution, had been passed by the Congress and I thus had full freedom to work on my own lines.
('41', 490, 3, 13, 898320) I could not answer this argument and had to accept.
('41', 490, 3, 14, 898372) Now I find that every effort is being made to belittle and ridicule these very Congress resolutions and it is a painful experience.
('41', 490, 4, 15, 898504) Yours affectionately, JAWAHARLAL

('41', 490, 6, 17, 898568) APPENDIX III FOREIGN PROPAGANDA BY C. RAJAGOPALACHARI
('41', 490, 7, 18, 898622) Before the Non co operation movement, Indian political activity largely consisted of propaganda in Great Britain.
('41', 490, 7, 19, 898736) A great deal of money, comparatively, was spent on it and was considered well spent.
('41', 490, 7, 20, 898821) When Gandhiji took up the guidance of our national affairs there was a change of outlook.
('41', 490, 7, 21, 898911) A grasp of the essentials of national strength was the first result of his programme and it marked all our political thought at the time.
('41', 490, 7, 22, 899049) We understood the natural laws that governed the sanctions needed for the non violent enforcement of national demands.
('41', 490, 7, 23, 899168) An almost exclusive spirit of self reliance was the natural consequence.
('41', 490, 7, 24, 899241) The cultivation of favourable opinion in foreign parts including Great Britain was valued at its correct worth and distinct efforts to that end were practically given up, and opposed vigorously whenever the question was raised.
('41', 490, 7, 25, 899469) So intense was the work in India and so marked were the results that the tables were soon turned, and instead of Indians going to do propaganda in Great Britain and foreign parts, India attracted numerous foreign visitors; and the British Government was forced to undertake counterpropaganda in foreign parts.
('41', 490, 7, 26, 899779) In India itself the Government had to give up its self confidence and organize its own propaganda among the people in order to resist or at least postpone the effects of the
('41', 491, 0, 1, 899953) 492 THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
('41', 491, 1, 2, 899995) national upheaval.
('41', 491, 2, 3, 900014) With the stoppage of aggressive non co operation, however, there has been a reversion in Indian thought.
('41', 491, 2, 4, 900119) Slowly but steadily the cry for foreign propaganda is gaining in volume again.
('41', 491, 2, 5, 900198) The internal situation also, namely, the difficulties in the way of united national action, has naturally led people to turn to easir outlets of activities abroad.
('41', 491, 2, 6, 900362) To those who still hold to the creed of non co operation and who look to emancipation only from within, this turn of the national gaze and energy to East and West is a symptom of growing weakness and a cause for anxiety.
('41', 491, 2, 7, 900583) The vision is bound to be cluded and constructive efforts are bound to be prejudicially affected by the growing tendency to this diversion.
('41', 491, 2, 8, 900723) Not only does it divert attention but some of the best workers will be drawn bodily into this channel of pleasanter though futile work.
('41', 491, 3, 9, 900859) Pre non co operation foreign propaganda was mostly propaganda in Britain.
('41', 491, 3, 10, 900933) But one of the permanent results of the efforts of these eight years is loss of faith in Britain.
('41', 491, 3, 11, 901031) The last vestiges of faith that stuck to the British Labour Party have been also destroyed.
('41', 491, 3, 12, 901123) The present harking back to foreign propaganda is therefore not for propaganda in England, but for the cultivation of contacts and friendship with other foreign nations.
('41', 491, 3, 13, 901293) We are told that it is very desirable to develop intimate association with the German and Russian people.
('41', 491, 3, 14, 901399) We are told that the Latin races of Europe present a favourable field for propaganda.
('41', 491, 3, 15, 901485) France, Italy, Spain and Portugal are mentioned.
('41', 491, 3, 16, 901534) Even Scandinavia is not forgotten, being important neutral soil.
('41', 491, 3, 17, 901599) We are told, again, that the need of the hour is to link India up with other countries suffering under like imperialistic exploitation.
('41', 491, 3, 18, 901735) We are asssured that the hope of India is a federated Asia rising against Western domination.
('41', 491, 3, 19, 901829) This change of attitude in regard to foreign propaganda had naturally its echo in the proceedings of the All India Congress Committee where foreign affairs dominated the atmosphere, and many resolutions were adopted calculated to form a basis for international friendships.
('41', 491, 4, 20, 902103) It would be narrow mindedness, indeed, and show us to be lacking the spirit of culture and humanity to refuse to have dealings with other nations if we were better circumstanced.
('41', 491, 4, 21, 902282) But what would be civilization and culture and broad mindedness under favourable circumstances would bee mere helplessness under existing conditions and would lead to nothing beneficial.
('41', 491, 4, 22, 902469) Friendship with other nations can grow and be beneficial only if as in personal friendships it is not cultivated on the mere expectation of advantages, all on one side.
('41', 491, 4, 23, 902638) If we seek honourable friendship with others there must be something for us to give them while we seek something from them.
('41', 491, 4, 24, 902762) If we are in effect truly unable to help others and only ask for something at their hands it would not conduce mutual esteem; nor can a healthy alliance grow.
('41', 491, 4, 25, 902921) If we are able really to help others, it must be by a supreme effort of national assertion which can and must, if well directed, produce far more marked results at home.
('41', 492, 0, 1, 903091) VOL. 41 : 3 DECEMBER, 1927 1 MAY, 1928 493
('41', 492, 1, 2, 903134) nations, whose friendship we go to woo, must find something to learn or something to gain from close association with us.
('41', 492, 1, 3, 903256) If we have going on amidst us some movement of dynamic value, some revolutionary effort or some great constructive activity worthy of copy or study on others part, we would be seeking friendship on honourable, if not equal, terms.
('41', 492, 1, 4, 903487) But we cannot be ever living either on the capital of our ancient culture or on the history of the Gandhian movement.
('41', 492, 2, 5, 903605) The link of mere friendship of slavery is not likely to be a real or useful bond.
('41', 492, 2, 6, 903687) Why do we turn to Russia, China or Turkey?
('41', 492, 2, 7, 903730) It is to simply the greatness of the past history of these nations that attracts us.
('41', 492, 2, 8, 903815) If that alone were offered we would hardly be interested.
('41', 492, 2, 9, 903873) But it is because we believe that there are great movements now going on in those countries which furnish matter for useful study or admiring observation, that some of our people go to those countries.
('41', 492, 2, 10, 904075) Similarly if we seek international friendship with such nations, we should have something to offer to them of value.
('41', 492, 2, 11, 904192) Otherwise we would only be beggars and should expect to be treated no better.
('41', 492, 3, 12, 904270) But then, it may be said, this is to ignore world politics.
('41', 492, 3, 13, 904330) There are wars coming on.
('41', 492, 3, 14, 904356) The nations of the world are ever seeking to subvert one anothers plans, and India is an important piece on the board.
('41', 492, 3, 15, 904475) We are not so helpless internationally as we may be internally in our own affairs.
('41', 492, 3, 16, 904558) This needs clearing up and plain talking.
('41', 492, 3, 17, 904600) Are we in for a war and the formation of alliances with those likely to fight England, or do we expect other countries to go to war over us?
('41', 492, 3, 18, 904741) If the powers abroad go to war, they do it with gunpowder and ships.
('41', 492, 3, 19, 904810) Are we ever likely usefull to participate as a nation in such war?
('41', 492, 3, 20, 904877) Is it contemplated that India and other slave nations in the East may enter into a treaty, some time in the future, to rise in revolt helping each other against the common foe?
('41', 492, 3, 21, 905054) Is India to expect, under any contingency arising in a world war, to render active assistance to a belligerent power against England?
('41', 492, 3, 22, 905188) What, to put only one argument, is the chance of our ever achieving anything in this way?
('41', 492, 3, 23, 905278) Is it practical politics of the remotest kind, disarmed as we are?
('41', 492, 4, 24, 905345) We do not want arms, it may said: we can do a great deal by passive resistance.
('41', 492, 4, 25, 905425) The only weapon in our hand is non co operation with the British Government during a war or peace.
('41', 492, 4, 26, 905524) Here we come back to the old position.
('41', 492, 4, 27, 905563) The Indian fight against England if it is to be by non violent means depends entirely on its own strength and can never be converted into an international affair.
('41', 492, 4, 28, 905726) In a non violent struggle it is not easy, if at all possible, to obtain any material help from abroad It must be conceived and organized and fought only on a basis of complete self reliance.
('41', 492, 5, 29, 905917) Non material moral help we can get from foreign countries.
('41', 492, 5, 30, 905976) This we shall do not by any propaganda, foreign or domestic, but exactly in the measure that we do solid constructive work and develop internal strength.

('41', 493, 9, 13, 906579) THIS BE SO, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY GOVERNMENT PUBLISHED

('41', 493, 11, 15, 906699) PROTECTION PAPERS TO FRAUDULENT ENTRANTS BEFORE 1ST AUGUST 1910.

('41', 493, 21, 26, 907314) WILL NOT KNOWINGLY GO BACK ON PREVIOUS PROMISE.
('41', 493, 21, 27, 907362) REGARDING
('41', 493, 22, 28, 907372) INTRODUCTION OF FAMILIES, THE NUMBER OF ENTRANTS BEFORE 1914 STILL
('41', 493, 23, 29, 907439) WITHOUT FAMILIES MUST BE SMALL.
('41', 493, 23, 30, 907471) NOR IS THERE GOOD REASON WHY IF
('41', 493, 24, 31, 907503) FRAUDULENT ENTRANTS AFTER 1914 REMAIN WITHOUT FAMILIES, THOSE
('41', 493, 25, 32, 907565) BEFORE 1914 SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THAT DESIRABILITY.
('41', 493, 25, 33, 907620) DEPARTMENT
('41', 493, 26, 34, 907631) ASK WHY FRAUDULENT ENTRANTS IN NATAL AND CAPE BEFORE 1914
('41', 493, 27, 35, 907689) SHOULD BE TREATED WORSE THAN SIMILAR PEOPLE IN TRANSVAAL.
('41', 493, 28, 36, 907747) ALSO FEAR THAT THERE BEING NO REGISTRATION CERTIFICATES IN THESE
